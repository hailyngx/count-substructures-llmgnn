Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
\[0 \rightarrow 3, 1 \rightarrow 5, 2 \rightarrow 2, 3 \rightarrow 8, 4 \rightarrow 3, 5 \rightarrow 4, 6 \rightarrow 5, 7 \rightarrow 5, 8 \rightarrow 4, 9 \rightarrow 1\]

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. The updated list of edges to consider is as follows:
(0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (3, 9)

Counting the number of triangles formed by these edges, we find the total number of triangles to be 3. 
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 4, 5>

Therefore, the final output is:
\[ [3] \]
