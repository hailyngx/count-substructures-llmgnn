Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly to start counting triangles. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their number of connections:
Vertex 3 (Degree 2)
Vertex 5 (Degree 3)
Vertex 6 (Degree 3)
Vertex 1 (Degree 4)
Vertex 8 (Degree 4)
Vertex 4 (Degree 6)
Vertex 2 (Degree 7)
Vertex 7 (Degree 7)
Vertex 9 (Degree 8)
Vertex 0 (Degree 9)

Now, we can start counting the triangles:
1. Triangles with Vertex 3:
- No triangles with Vertex 3 (Degree 2).

2. Triangles with Vertex 5:
- No triangles with Vertex 5 (Degree 3).

3. Triangles with Vertex 6:
- No triangles with Vertex 6 (Degree 3).

4. Triangles with Vertex 1:
- No triangles with Vertex 1 (Degree 4).

5. Triangles with Vertex 8:
- No triangles with Vertex 8 (Degree 4).

6. Triangles with Vertex 4:
- No triangles with Vertex 4 (Degree 6).

7. Triangles with Vertex 2:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>

8. Triangles with Vertex 7:
- Triangle <0, 7, 9>
- Triangle <2, 7, 9>

9. Triangles with Vertex 9:
- No additional triangles with Vertex 9 (Degree 8).

10. Triangles with Vertex 0:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4> and <0, 7, 9>.
