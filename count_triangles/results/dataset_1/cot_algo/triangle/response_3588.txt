Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new order is: 1, 6, 8, 5, 7, 9, 0, 2, 3, 4.

Using Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found are: 
<4, 0, 5>
<4, 0, 2>
<4, 3, 1>
<9, 7, 4>

Total number of triangles: [4]
