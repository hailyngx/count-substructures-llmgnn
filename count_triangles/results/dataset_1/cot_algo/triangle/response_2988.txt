Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 0 has a degree of 2
- Vertex 1 has a degree of 2
- Vertex 3 has a degree of 3
- Vertex 4 has a degree of 4
- Vertex 5 has a degree of 4
- Vertex 6 has a degree of 2
- Vertex 7 has a degree of 1
- Vertex 8 has a degree of 5

Next, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 7 (degree 1)
- Vertex 0 (degree 2)
- Vertex 1 (degree 2)
- Vertex 6 (degree 2)
- Vertex 3 (degree 3)
- Vertex 5 (degree 4)
- Vertex 4 (degree 4)
- Vertex 8 (degree 5)

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the ordering of the vertices:
- Edge between 7 and 8: No triangle formed
- Edge between 0 and 1: No triangle formed
- Edge between 6 and 3: Triangle <3, 4, 6>
- Edge between 3 and 4: Triangle <3, 4, 5>
- Edge between 3 and 8: Triangle <3, 4, 8>
- Edge between 4 and 8: Triangle <4, 5, 8>
- Edge between 5 and 8: Triangle <4, 5, 8>
- Edge between 5 and 4: Triangle <4, 5, 3>
- Edge between 5 and 1: No triangle formed
- Edge between 5 and 0: No triangle formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, and <4, 5, 8>.
