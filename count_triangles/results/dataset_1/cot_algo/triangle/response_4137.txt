Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles by examining each edge:

(0, 3): Node 0 and Node 3 do not share any common connections.
(0, 8): Node 0 and Node 8 do not share any common connections.
(1, 2): Node 1 and Node 2 do not share any common connections.
(1, 4): Node 1 and Node 4 do not share any common connections.
(1, 8): Node 1 and Node 8 do not share any common connections.
(1, 9): Node 1 and Node 9 do not share any common connections.
(2, 4): Node 2 and Node 4 do not share any common connections.
(2, 6): Node 2 and Node 6 do not share any common connections.
(3, 0): Node 0 and Node 3 do not share any common connections.
(4, 1): Node 1 and Node 4 share a common connection with Node 2, forming a triangle: <1, 2, 4>.
(4, 2): Node 2 and Node 4 do not share any common connections.
(4, 6): Node 4 and Node 6 do not share any common connections.
(4, 8): Node 4 and Node 8 share a common connection with Node 1, forming a triangle: <1, 4, 8>.
(4, 9): Node 4 and Node 9 do not share any common connections.
(6, 2): Node 2 and Node 6 do not share any common connections.
(6, 4): Node 4 and Node 6 do not share any common connections.
(7, 8): Node 7 and Node 8 do not share any common connections.
(8, 0): Node 0 and Node 8 do not share any common connections.
(8, 1): Node 1 and Node 8 do not share any common connections.
(8, 4): Node 4 and Node 8 do not share any common connections.
(8, 7): Node 7 and Node 8 do not share any common connections.
(9, 1): Node 1 and Node 9 do not share any common connections.
(9, 4): Node 4 and Node 9 do not share any common connections.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 8>
