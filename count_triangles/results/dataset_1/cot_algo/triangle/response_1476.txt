Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree.

Vertex 3: degree 0
Vertex 5: degree 1
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 6

Following the rule of proceeding only if the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles formed by looking at shared connections along the edges:

1. (0, 4) & (4, 7) - <0, 4, 7>
2. (0, 7) & (7, 4) - <0, 4, 7>
3. (4, 6) & (6, 9) - <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
