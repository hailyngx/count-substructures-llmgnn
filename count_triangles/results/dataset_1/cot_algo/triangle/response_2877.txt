Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0: 2, 3, 4
1: 4, 6
2: 0, 7, 8
3: 0, 9
4: 0, 1, 8, 9
5: 6, 7
6: 1, 5, 7
7: 2, 5, 6, 9
8: 2, 4, 9
9: 3, 4, 7, 8
```

Sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following new labels:
```
0: 3
1: 2
3: 2
5: 2
3: 2
2: 3
4: 4
7: 4
8: 3
9: 4
```

Now, we will iterate through the edges in the order given and count the triangles.

1. Edge (0, 2): Both vertices have label 3, so we proceed. No triangles formed.
2. Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 has label 3 and vertex 3 has label 2, so we proceed. No triangles formed.
3. Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 has label 3 and vertex 4 has label 4, so no need to proceed as 4 has more connections.
4. Edge (1, 4): Both vertices have label 2, so we proceed. No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 6): Both vertices have label 2, so we proceed. No triangles formed.
6. Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 has label 3 and vertex 7 has label 4, so no need to proceed as 7 has more connections.
7. Edge (2, 8): Vertex 2 has label 3 and vertex 8 has label 3, so we proceed. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>.
8. Edge (3, 9): Both vertices have label 2, so we proceed. No triangles formed.
9. Edge (4, 8): Both vertices have label 4, so we proceed. No triangles formed.
10. Edge (4, 9): Vertex 4 has label 4 and vertex 9 has label 4, so we proceed. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 9>.
11. Edge (5, 6): Both vertices have label 2, so we proceed. No triangles formed.
12. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has label 2 and vertex 7 has label 4, so no need to proceed as 7 has more connections.
13. Edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 has label 2 and vertex 7 has label 4, so no need to proceed as 7 has more connections.
14. Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has label 4 and vertex 9 has label 4, so we proceed. No triangles formed.
15. Edge (8, 9): Both vertices have label 3, so we proceed. No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <2, 4, 8>, <4, 7, 9>.
