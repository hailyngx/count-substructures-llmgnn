Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their number of connections. Then we will proceed to count the triangles as described in the instructions.

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections), the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 2 has 1 connection
Node 6 has 1 connection
Node 8 has 1 connection
Node 0 has 2 connections
Node 7 has 3 connections
Node 5 has 3 connections
Node 9 has 4 connections
Node 3 has 4 connections
Node 1 has 5 connections
Node 4 has 5 connections

Based on the sorted labels, we can now count the number of triangles. The triangles found are:
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
