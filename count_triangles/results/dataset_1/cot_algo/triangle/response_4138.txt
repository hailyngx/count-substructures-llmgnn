Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 1
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 2
Vertex 8: degree 4

Now, we relabel the vertices:

Vertex 4: 1 
Vertex 1: 2 
Vertex 2: 3 
Vertex 3: 4 
Vertex 7: 5 
Vertex 6: 6 
Vertex 5: 7 
Vertex 8: 8 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge in the order of the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections. We proceed as follows:

1. Check (1, 5):
    - Shared connections: none
    
2. Check (1, 7):
    - Shared connections: none
    
3. Check (2, 3):
    - Shared connections: none
    
4. Check (3, 2):
    - Shared connections: none
    
5. Check (3, 8):
    - Shared connections: <2, 3, 4>
    
6. Check (4, 8):
    - Shared connections: <2, 3, 4>
    
7. Check (5, 1):
    - Shared connections: none
    
8. Check (5, 6):
    - Shared connections: none
    
9. Check (5, 7):
    - Shared connections: none
   
10. Check (6, 8):
    - Shared connections: none
   
11. Check (7, 1):
    - Shared connections: none
   
12. Check (7, 5):
    - Shared connections: none
   
13. Check (8, 3):
    - Shared connections: <2, 3, 4>
   
14. Check (8, 4):
    - Shared connections: <2, 3, 4>
    
15. Check (8, 6):
    - Shared connections: none

The total number of triangles is 3, and the unique triangles found are <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, and <3, 4, 8>. Therefore, the answer is [3].
