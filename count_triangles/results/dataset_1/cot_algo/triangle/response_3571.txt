Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to create a Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 3: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 8

Now, we will go through each edge starting from the one with the vertex of lower label and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2) - shared connection with 9
2. Edge (0, 8) - no triangles
3. Edge (0, 9) - shared connection with 2 and 8
4. Edge (2, 4) - shared connection with 6, 9
5. Edge (2, 6) - shared connection with 4, 9
6. Edge (2, 7) - no triangles
7. Edge (2, 8) - shared connection with 0, 9
8. Edge (2, 9) - shared connection with 0, 4, 6, 8
9. Edge (3, 5) - no triangles
10. Edge (4, 6) - shared connection with 2, 9
11. Edge (4, 9) - shared connection with 2, 6
12. Edge (5, 3) - no triangles
13. Edge (7, 9) - shared connection with 2, 4
14. Edge (8, 0) - no triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [15] and the unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 9>.
