Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the degrees of each vertex to sort them in ascending order:
- Degree of 0: 2
- Degree of 1: 4
- Degree of 2: 3
- Degree of 3: 4
- Degree of 4: 2
- Degree of 5: 1
- Degree of 6: 3
- Degree of 8: 4
- Degree of 9: 1

Now, we can relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 5 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 9 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 2 (Degree 3) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 6 (Degree 3) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 0 (Degree 2) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 4 (Degree 2) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 8 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 1 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 3 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 8

Now, let's list the edges in the new order:
(4, 8) (4, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (7, 4) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (0, 3)

Now let's count the triangles formed by each edge:

- (4, 8): <4, 8, 6>
- (4, 1): No triangle formed
- (2, 7): No triangle formed
- (2, 8): <2, 8, 6>
- (2, 5): No triangle formed
- (2, 3): No triangle formed
- (7, 4): No triangle formed
- (2, 6): <2, 6, 8>
- (8, 1): <8, 1, 4>
- (8, 3): <8, 3, 2>
- (8, 5): No triangle formed
- (8, 6): No triangle formed
- (1, 4): No triangle formed
- (1, 2): <1, 2, 8>
- (0, 3): No triangle formed

Total number of triangles: [4]

Triangles found: <4, 8, 6>, <2, 8, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <8, 1, 4>, <8, 3, 2>, <1, 2, 8>
