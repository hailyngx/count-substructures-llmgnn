Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 3: 1 connection  
Node 4: 2 connections  
Node 5: 2 connections  
Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 2: 5 connections  
Node 9: 5 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles formed by shared connections:

- Triangle <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle <2, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
