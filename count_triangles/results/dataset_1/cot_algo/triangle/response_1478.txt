Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 8: 0 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 4: 7 connections
Node 0: 7 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will iterate through the edges and count the number of triangles:

1. Consider edge (2, 7):
   - Node 2 has 1 connection and Node 7 has 5 connections. So, proceed.
   - Shared connections between 2 and 7: [0]
   - No triangle found.

2. Consider edge (5, 7):
   - Node 5 has 1 connection and Node 7 has 5 connections. So, proceed.
   - Shared connections between 5 and 7: []
   - No triangle found.

3. Consider edge (6, 4):
   - Node 6 has 2 connections and Node 4 has 7 connections. So, proceed.
   - Shared connections between 6 and 4: [0]
   - No triangle found.

4. Consider edge (7, 2):
   - Node 7 has 5 connections and Node 2 has 1 connection. Do not proceed as the lower labeled vertex has more connections.

5. Consider edge (0, 9):
   - Node 0 has 7 connections and Node 9 has 2 connections. So, proceed.
   - Shared connections between 0 and 9: [3]
   - Triangle formed: <0, 3, 9>

6. Continue this process for all edges.

After iterating through all edges, the total number of triangles found is 1.
The unique triangle found is <0, 3, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
