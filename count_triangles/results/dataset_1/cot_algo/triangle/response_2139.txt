Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices by their degrees:

- Vertex 3: degree 1
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 6
- Vertex 4: degree 7

Next, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: [] 
Unique triangles: <> 

Therefore, there are a total of 0 triangles in the given graph.
