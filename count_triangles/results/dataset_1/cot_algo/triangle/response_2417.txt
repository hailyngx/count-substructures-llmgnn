Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their connections are: 

Node 2 has 0 connections.
Node 4 has 0 connections.
Node 1 has 1 connections.
Node 5 has 1 connections.
Node 7 has 1 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 9 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. Thus, we will consider the following edges: (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 3), (5, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 6).

With these edges, we can find the following unique triangles:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
