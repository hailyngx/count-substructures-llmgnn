Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes will be:
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 5: 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles identified in the graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 8, 6>

There are 15 triangles in total, which can be denoted as [15].
