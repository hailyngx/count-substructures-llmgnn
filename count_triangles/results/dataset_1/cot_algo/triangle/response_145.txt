Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 6: degree 0
- Node 9: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is [5].

The unique triangles found are:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 5, 0>
- <1, 5, 4>
