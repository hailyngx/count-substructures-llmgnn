Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
By sorting the nodes based on their degrees, we get the following order: 
Nodes: 3, 7, 0, 5, 2, 6, 8, 9, 1, 4

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For edge (0, 2): Node 0 has 3 connections and Node 2 has 2 connections. They share 1 common connection (Node 6), so there is 1 triangle <0, 2, 6>.

- For edge (0, 6): Node 0 has 3 connections and Node 6 has 3 connections. They share 1 common connection (Node 2), so there is 1 triangle <0, 2, 6>.

- For edge (0, 9): Node 0 has 3 connections and Node 9 has 4 connections. They share 1 common connection (Node 1), so there is 1 triangle <0, 1, 9>.

- For edge (1, 4): Node 1 has 4 connections and Node 4 has 4 connections. They share 3 common connections (Nodes 5, 6, 9), so there are 3 triangles <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>.

- For edge (1, 5): Node 1 has 4 connections and Node 5 has 3 connections. They share 1 common connection (Node 4), so there is 1 triangle <1, 4, 5>.

- For edge (1, 6): Node 1 has 4 connections and Node 6 has 3 connections. They share 1 common connection (Node 0), so there is 1 triangle <0, 1, 6>.

- For edge (1, 9): Node 1 has 4 connections and Node 9 has 4 connections. They share 2 common connections (Nodes 0, 4), so there are 2 triangles <0, 1, 9>, <1, 4, 9>.

- For edge (2, 6): Node 2 has 2 connections and Node 6 has 3 connections. They share 1 common connection (Node 0), so there is 1 triangle <0, 2, 6>.

- For edge (3, 8): Node 3 has 1 connection and Node 8 has 4 connections. They do not share any common connections, so no triangle is formed.

- For edge (3, 9): Node 3 has 1 connection and Node 9 has 4 connections. They share 1 common connection (Node 1), so there is 1 triangle <1, 3, 9>.

- For edge (4, 5): Node 4 has 4 connections and Node 5 has 3 connections. They share 1 common connection (Node 1), so there is 1 triangle <1, 4, 5>.

- For edge (4, 8): Node 4 has 4 connections and Node 8 has 3 connections. They share 1 common connection (Node 3), so there is 1 triangle <3, 4, 8>.

- For edge (4, 9): Node 4 has 4 connections and Node 9 has 4 connections. They share 2 common connections (Nodes 1, 0), so there are 2 triangles <0, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 9>.

- For edge (5, 1): Already counted when considering edge (1, 5).

- For edge (5, 4): Already counted when considering edge (4, 5).

- For edge (6, 0): Already counted when considering edge (0, 6).

- For edge (6, 1): Already counted when considering edge (1, 6).

- For edge (6, 2): Already counted when considering edge (2, 6).

- For edge (7, 8): Node 7 has 1 connection and Node 8 has 3 connections. They do not share any common connections, so no triangle is formed.

- For edge (8, 3): Already counted when considering edge (3, 8).

- For edge (8, 4): Already counted when considering edge (4, 8).

- For edge (8, 7): Already counted when considering edge (7, 8).

- For edge (9, 0): Already counted when considering edge (0, 9).

- For edge (9, 1): Already counted when considering edge (1, 9).

- For edge (9, 3): Already counted when considering edge (3, 9).

- For edge (9, 4): Already counted when considering edge (4, 9).

Total number of triangles: [12]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 12.
