Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, the ordering becomes: 
(0: 5 connections), (1: 2 connections), (2: 3 connections), (3: 2 connections), (5: 1 connection), (6: 4 connections), (7: 3 connections), (8: 3 connections), (9: 4 connections), (4: 5 connections).

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will analyze the edges according to the order of vertices. 

Analyzing the edges in the order mentioned in the question: 
1. (0, 1): No triangles formed.
2. (0, 6): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
3. (0, 7): No triangles formed.
4. (0, 8): No triangles formed.
5. (0, 9): No triangles formed.
6. (1, 0): No triangles formed.
7. (1, 2): No triangles formed.
8. (2, 1): No triangles formed.
9. (2, 4): Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>.
10. (2, 8): No triangles formed.
11. (3, 4): No triangles formed.
12. (3, 7): No triangles formed.
13. (4, 2): Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
14. (4, 3): No triangles formed.
15. (4, 6): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
16. (4, 8): No triangles formed.
17. (4, 9): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>.
18. (5, 6): No triangles formed.
19. (6, 0): No triangles formed.
20. (6, 4): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
21. (6, 5): No triangles formed.
22. (6, 9): Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>.
23. (7, 0): No triangles formed.
24. (7, 3): No triangles formed.
25. (7, 9): No triangles formed.
26. (8, 0): No triangles formed.
27. (8, 2): No triangles formed.
28. (8, 4): No triangles formed.
29. (9, 0): No triangles formed.
30. (9, 4): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>.
31. (9, 6): Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>.
32. (9, 7): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, and <0, 4, 9>.
