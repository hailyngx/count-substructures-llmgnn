Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on their number of connections:

Nodes:
0 - 2 connections
1 - 0 connections
3 - 1 connection
4 - 2 connections
5 - 2 connections
6 - 3 connections
7 - 5 connections
8 - 4 connections
9 - 3 connections

Based on the sorting, the new labels for the vertices are:
0 > 1 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7 > 8 > 9

Now, we will count the triangles by checking the shared connections between vertices of each edge:

Triangles:
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
