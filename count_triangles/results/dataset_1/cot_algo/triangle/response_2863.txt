Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 -> 3 connections
Node 1 -> 3 connections
Node 4 -> 2 connections
Node 6 -> 2 connections
Node 8 -> 2 connections
Node 9 -> 2 connections
Node 3 -> 2 connections
Node 5 -> 3 connections
Node 7 -> 4 connections
Node 2 -> 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph.
We start with the edge involving the vertex with lower label and fewer connections:

For edge (0, 2):
Both 0 and 2 are connected to 3 and 7, forming a triangle <0, 2, 7>.

For edge (0, 3):
Both 0 and 3 are connected to 2, forming a triangle <0, 2, 3>.

For edge (1, 5):
Both 1 and 5 are connected to 6, forming a triangle <1, 5, 6>.

For edge (1, 6):
Node 1 has a connection with node 7, and node 6 has a connection with node 5, forming a triangle <1, 6, 5>.

For edge (1, 7):
Node 1 has a connection with node 5, and node 7 has connections with nodes 2 and 4, forming triangles <1, 5, 7> and <1, 7, 2>.

For edge (4, 5):
Node 4 has connections with nodes 7 and 1, and node 5 has a connection with 6, forming a triangle <4, 5, 6>.

For edge (5, 6):
Both 5 and 6 are connected to 1, forming a triangle <5, 6, 1>.

For edge (7, 4):
Both 7 and 4 are connected to 1, forming a triangle <7, 4, 1>.

For edge (7, 5):
Both 7 and 5 are connected to 1, forming a triangle <7, 5, 1>.

For edge (7, 2):
Node 7 is connected to node 4 and node 1, and node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8, forming a triangle <7, 2, 1>.

The total number of triangles is [7].
