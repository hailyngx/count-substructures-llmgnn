Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 9: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles in the graph:

Triangles:
- <0, 7, 1>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 6, 5>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <4, 9, 6>

Total number of triangles: [9]
