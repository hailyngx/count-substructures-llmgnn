Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their connections are:

Node 7: 0 connections
Node 8: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections

Examining the edges with the lower-labeled vertices having fewer connections, we find the following triangles:

- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <2, 5, 6>

Counting the total number of triangles: [5]
