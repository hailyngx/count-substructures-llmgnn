Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 1 - 3 connections  
Node 6 - 3 connections  
Node 8 - 3 connections  
Node 9 - 3 connections  
Node 0 - 4 connections  
Node 7 - 4 connections  
Node 2 - 5 connections  
Node 5 - 6 connections  
Node 3 - 7 connections  
Node 4 - 7 connections  

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and examining the edges, we can find the triangles in the graph:  
1. <0, 4, 5>  
2. <0, 4, 6>  
3. <0, 4, 9>  
4. <2, 3, 5>  
5. <2, 3, 7>  
6. <2, 5, 8>  
7. <3, 5, 8>  
8. <4, 5, 8>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
