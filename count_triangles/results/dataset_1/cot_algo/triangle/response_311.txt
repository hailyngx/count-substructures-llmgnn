Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most connections: 
Nodes: 4, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 7, 0, 3, 5  

Applying the degree-based ordering method, we will analyze the edges as follows:

(1) Edge (4, 1): Node 4 has degree 1, and Node 1 has degree 5. Not processed.
(2) Edge (7, 5): Node 7 has degree 1, and Node 5 has degree 6. Not processed.
(3) Edge (8, 0): Node 8 has degree 2, and Node 0 has degree 4. Possible triangle: 0, 8, 9.
(4) Edge (9, 0): Node 9 has degree 2, and Node 0 has degree 4. Not processed.
(5) Edge (1, 6): Node 1 has degree 5, and Node 6 has degree 5. Possible triangle: 1, 0, 6.
(6) Edge (5, 7): Node 5 has degree 6, and Node 7 has degree 1. Not processed.
(7) Edge (5, 1): Node 5 has degree 6, and Node 1 has degree 5. Possible triangle: 1, 5, 6.
(8) Edge (3, 6): Node 3 has degree 6, and Node 6 has degree 5. Possible triangle: 0, 3, 6.
(9) Edge (3, 2): Node 3 has degree 6, and Node 2 has degree 2. Not processed.
(10) Edge (6, 0): Node 6 has degree 5, and Node 0 has degree 4. Possible triangle: 0, 6, 9.
(11) Edge (6, 1): Node 6 has degree 5, and Node 1 has degree 5. Possible triangle: 1, 0, 6.
(12) Edge (5, 9): Node 5 has degree 6, and Node 9 has degree 2. Possible triangle: 0, 5, 9.
(13) Edge (3, 5): Node 3 has degree 6, and Node 5 has degree 6. Possible triangle: 0, 3, 5.

Calculating the total number of triangles and listing the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 8, 9>, <1, 0, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 3, 5>
