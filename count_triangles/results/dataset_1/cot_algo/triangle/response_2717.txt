Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 3: 0 connections
Vertex 8: 0 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles:

1. For edge (3, 7): No triangles formed.
2. For edge (8, 3): No triangles formed.
3. For edge (9, 5): No triangles formed.
4. For edge (2, 0): No triangles formed.
5. For edge (6, 4): Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>.
6. For edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
7. For edge (5, 4): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>.
8. For edge (5, 9): No triangles formed.
9. For edge (7, 3): No triangles formed.
10. For edge (7, 6): Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>.
11. For edge (7, 0): Triangle formed: <0, 1, 7>.
12. For edge (7, 1): Triangle formed: <0, 1, 7>.
13. For edge (0, 1): No triangles formed.
14. For edge (0, 7): Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>.
15. For edge (0, 5): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>.
16. For edge (0, 4): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>.
17. For edge (0, 2): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
