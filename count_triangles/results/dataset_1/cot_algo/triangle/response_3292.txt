Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph as follows:

1. Determine the degrees of each node:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6

2. Sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 1: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 0: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 8: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6

3. Traverse the edges based on the sorted nodes:

Starting with edges involving nodes with degrees 2:
- Edge (1, 8): no triangles
- Edge (3, 6): no triangles

Moving on to edges involving nodes with degrees 3:
- Edge (7, 5): forms triangle <5, 7, 9>

Continuing with edges involving nodes with degrees 4:
- Edge (0, 5): forms triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Edge (2, 4): no triangles
- Edge (6, 2): no triangles
- Edge (4, 9): forms triangle <4, 5, 9>
- Edge (4, 8): forms triangle <4, 8, 9>

Checking edges involving nodes with degrees 5:
- Edge (5, 6): forms triangle <5, 6, 7>
- Edge (5, 7): forms triangle <5, 6, 7>
- Edge (5, 9): forms triangle <5, 7, 9>

Exploring edges involving nodes with degrees 6:
- Edge (8, 9): forms triangle <8, 9, 5>

4. Count the total number of triangles: [5]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 5.
