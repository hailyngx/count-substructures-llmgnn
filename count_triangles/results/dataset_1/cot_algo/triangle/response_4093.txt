Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order and label them accordingly:
Vertices sorted by degree: 3, 0, 7, 9, 2, 1, 8, 6, 5, 4

The sorted edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections are:
(3, 4), (0, 5), (7, 1), (9, 4), (2, 4), (1, 6), (8, 2), (6, 4), (5, 0), (4, 2), (7, 5), (9, 7), (5, 2), (4, 3), (1, 8), (6, 0)

Now, we will find the triangles formed by these edges:
- Triangle <0, 5, 6> is formed by shared connection 5.
- Triangle <1, 6, 7> is formed by shared connection 6.
- Triangle <2, 4, 5> is formed by shared connection 5.
- Triangle <2, 4, 8> is formed by shared connection 4.
- Triangle <4, 6, 5> is formed by shared connection 6.
- Triangle <4, 6, 8> is formed by shared connection 6.

Total number of triangles: [6]
