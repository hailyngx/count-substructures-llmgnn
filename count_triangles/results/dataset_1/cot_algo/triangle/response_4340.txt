Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's begin by sorting the vertices based on their degree:

- Vertex 2: Degree 0
- Vertex 9: Degree 1
- Vertex 0: Degree 2
- Vertex 1: Degree 3
- Vertex 8: Degree 3
- Vertex 7: Degree 4
- Vertex 6: Degree 4
- Vertex 5: Degree 5
- Vertex 4: Degree 5
- Vertex 3: Degree 5

Now, we will reorder the nodes based on their degrees:

- Vertex 2: Degree 0
- Vertex 9: Degree 1
- Vertex 0: Degree 2
- **Vertex 1: Degree 3**
- **Vertex 8: Degree 3**
- **Vertex 7: Degree 4**
- **Vertex 6: Degree 4**
- **Vertex 5: Degree 5**
- **Vertex 4: Degree 5**
- **Vertex 3: Degree 5**

We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Let's list the triangles formed by shared connections:

- Triangle <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle <1, 4, 3>
- Triangle <1, 5, 3>
- Triangle <5, 6, 3>
- Triangle <5, 6, 1>
- Triangle <5, 4, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **[6]**.
