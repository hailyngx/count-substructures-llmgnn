Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2

Next, we will relabel the nodes according to their degrees:
- Node 6 (degree 2) becomes Node 0
- Node 8 (degree 2) becomes Node 1
- Node 9 (degree 2) becomes Node 2
- Node 2 (degree 3) becomes Node 3
- Node 5 (degree 3) becomes Node 4
- Node 0 (degree 3) becomes Node 5
- Node 3 (degree 3) becomes Node 6
- Node 7 (degree 4) becomes Node 7
- Node 1 (degree 4) becomes Node 8
- Node 4 (degree 4) becomes Node 9

Now, let's list the edges according to the new node labels:
(5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) 
(8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) 
(9, 6) (9, 0) 
(6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 3) 
(7, 4) (7, 9)

Now, we will count the triangles by checking for shared connections:
- Triangle 1: <6, 7, 9>
- Triangle 2: <4, 7, 9>
- Triangle 3: <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
