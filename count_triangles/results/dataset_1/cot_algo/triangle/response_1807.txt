Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering each edge, we count the triangles by checking for shared connections between vertices:

[Count of triangles: 6]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
