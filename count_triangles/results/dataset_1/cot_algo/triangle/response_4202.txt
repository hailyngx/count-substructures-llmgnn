Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes by their degrees:

Node 4: degree 1
Node 2: degree 1
Node 5: degree 1
Node 3: degree 1
Node 8: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4

Next, we will list the triangles:

<0, 7, 1>
<0, 9, 5>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<6, 4, 9>

Counting the triangles in the graph, we get a total of [5].
