Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 6
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 8: Degree 1

Next, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:

Node 8: Label 0
Node 0: Label 1
Node 4: Label 2
Node 6: Label 3
Node 2: Label 4
Node 7: Label 5
Node 5: Label 6

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 7): Nodes 0 and 7 have shared connection with Node 4. Triangle: <0, 4, 7>
2. Edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (5, 2): Nodes 2 and 5 have shared connection with Node 4. Triangle: <2, 4, 5>
7. Edge (5, 4): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (5, 6): Nodes 5 and 6 have shared connection with Node 7. Triangle: <5, 6, 7>
9. Edge (5, 7): Nodes 5 and 7 have shared connection with Nodes 0, 4, and 6. Triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>
10. Edge (6, 5): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (6, 7): Nodes 6 and 7 have shared connection with Nodes 0 and 5. Triangles: <0, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 7>
12. Edge (7, 0): Node 0 and 7 have shared connection with Node 4. Triangle: <0, 4, 7>
13. Edge (7, 4): Nodes 4 and 7 have shared connection with Nodes 0 and 5. Triangles: <0, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>
14. Edge (7, 5): Nodes 5 and 7 have shared connection with Nodes 0, 4, and 6. Triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>
15. Edge (7, 6): Nodes 6 and 7 have shared connection with Nodes 0 and 5. Triangles: <0, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 7>
16. Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10] inside brackets. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<5, 6, 7>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 7>
