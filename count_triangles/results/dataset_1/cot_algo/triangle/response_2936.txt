Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we relabel them as follows:
Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 1 connection.
Node 8 has 1 connection.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 5 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we find the triangles and count them:
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
