Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are:
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
[13] 

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 4>
