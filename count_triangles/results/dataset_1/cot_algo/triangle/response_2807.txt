Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices should be relabeled as follows based on the number of connections:
Vertices: [0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 8, 6]

Now we will count the triangles:
For edge (0, 8):
- Vertex 0 and 8 share a connection with vertex 1, forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.

For edge (1, 6):
No triangles are formed as the conditions are not met.

For edge (1, 8):
- Vertex 1 and 8 share a connection with vertex 0, forming a triangle <1, 0, 8>.

For edge (2, 9):
No triangles are formed as the conditions are not met.

For edge (3, 8):
No triangles are formed as the conditions are not met.

For edge (4, 9):
No triangles are formed as the conditions are not met.

For edge (6, 1):
No triangles are formed as the conditions are not met.

For edge (6, 9):
- Vertex 6 and 9 share a connection with vertex 1, forming a triangle <6, 1, 9>.

For edge (8, 0):
- Vertex 8 and 0 share a connection with vertex 1, forming a triangle <8, 1, 0>.

For edge (8, 1):
- Vertex 8 and 1 share a connection with vertex 0, forming a triangle <8, 0, 1>.

For edge (8, 3):
No triangles are formed as the conditions are not met.

For edge (9, 2):
No triangles are formed as the conditions are not met.

For edge (9, 4):
No triangles are formed as the conditions are not met.

For edge (9, 6):
No triangles are formed as the conditions are not met.

The total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 8>, <6, 1, 9>
