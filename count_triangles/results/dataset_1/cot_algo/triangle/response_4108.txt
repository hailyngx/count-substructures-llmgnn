Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 1
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we can count the triangles:

- Edge (1, 9): Shared connection with node 0 forms triangle <0, 1, 9>
- Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed
- Edge (4, 8): Shared connection with node 5 forms triangle <4, 5, 8>
- Edge (7, 5): Shared connection with node 6 forms triangle <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, and <5, 6, 7>.
