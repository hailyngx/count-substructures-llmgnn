Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
(2 connections) - 0, 2, 4, 8
(3 connections) - 7, 9
(4 connections) - 3
(5 connections) - 1, 5
(6 connections) - 6
