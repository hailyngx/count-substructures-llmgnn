Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
- Node 8 (1 connection): Vertex 0
- Node 6 (1 connection): Vertex 1
- Node 7 (1 connection): Vertex 2
- Node 8 (2 connections): Vertex 3
- Node 5 (2 connections): Vertex 4
- Node 3 (1 connection): Vertex 5
- Node 4 (1 connection): Vertex 6
- Node 4 (2 connections): Vertex 7
- Node 2 (1 connection): Vertex 8
- Node 4 (3 connections): Vertex 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles and their corresponding vertices are:
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <2, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
