Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have the following labels for the vertices:
Vertices: 6-3-5-1-2-7-9-0-4-8

Checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 9, 3>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 8, 4>
<3, 9, 0>
<4, 8, 6>
<4, 9, 0>
<4, 9, 3>
<6, 7, 1>
<7, 0, 9>
<8, 0, 9>
<8, 3, 4>
<8, 4, 9>
<9, 0, 3>
<9, 1, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [18].
