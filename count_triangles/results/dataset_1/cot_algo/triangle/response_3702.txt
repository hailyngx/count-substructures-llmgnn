Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertices: 3, 7, 2, 1, 0, 6, 5, 8, 4, 9

The edges are re-ordered as follows according to the new labels:
(0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Looking at the edges, we proceed with the vertex with the lower label when the degrees aren't equal: 
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
