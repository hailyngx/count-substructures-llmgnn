Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 2, 9, 5, 7, 4, 0, 2, 6, 3, 1.

Now, we will iterate through each edge and count the number of triangles:

For edge (0, 1):
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 4, 6, and 8.
- Nodes 0 and 1 share node 8, forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.

For edge (0, 3):
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 3 has connections with nodes 0, 2, and 8.
- No triangles are formed.

For edge (0, 8):
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, and 9.
- Nodes 0 and 8 share nodes 1 and 3, forming triangles <0, 1, 8> and <0, 3, 8>.

For the remaining edges, no additional triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
