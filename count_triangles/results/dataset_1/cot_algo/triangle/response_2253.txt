Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices: 
1 -> degree 2
2 -> degree 1
5 -> degree 0
10 -> degree 0
6 -> degree 1
7 -> degree 2
3 -> degree 3
4 -> degree 3
8 -> degree 4
9 -> degree 4

Now, let's relabel the vertices to match this degree-based ordering:
1 -> 1
2 -> 6
5 -> 10
10 -> 5
6 -> 2
7 -> 7
3 -> 3
4 -> 4
8 -> 8
9 -> 9

Now, let's count the number of triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (1, 3) [1 has 2 connections, 3 has 3 connections]:
   Shared connections: None

2. Edge (1, 4) [1 has 2 connections, 4 has 3 connections]:
   Shared connections: None

3. Edge (2, 8) [2 has 1 connection, 8 has 4 connections]:
   Shared connections: None

4. Edge (3, 1) [3 has 3 connections, 1 has 2 connections]:
   Shared connections: None

5. Edge (3, 4) [3 has 3 connections, 4 has 3 connections]:
   Shared connections: None

6. Edge (4, 1) [4 has 3 connections, 1 has 2 connections]:
   Shared connections: None

7. Edge (6, 9) [6 has 1 connection, 9 has 4 connections]:
   Shared connections: None

8. Edge (7, 3) [7 has 2 connections, 3 has 3 connections]:
   Shared connections: None

9. Edge (8, 2) [8 has 4 connections, 2 has 1 connection]:
   Shared connections: None

10. Edge (9, 6) [9 has 4 connections, 6 has 1 connection]:
   Shared connections: None

11. Edge (9, 7) [9 has 4 connections, 7 has 2 connections]:
   Shared connections: None

12. Edge (10, 5) [No shared connections, as both nodes have degree 0]

[Total number of triangles: 0]
