Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of vertices with their number of connections is as follows:
Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 7: 0 connections
Vertices 2, 3, 9: 1 connection
Vertices 4, 8: 2 connections
Vertices 0, 6: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(5, 6), (7, 6), (2, 3), (2, 9), (3, 0), (9, 1), (4, 8), (4, 1), (8, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9), (8, 4)

After applying the degree-based ordering method, the total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
