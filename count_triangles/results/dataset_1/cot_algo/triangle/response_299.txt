Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
Node 1 (1 connections): relabeled as 9
Node 5 (1 connections): relabeled as 8
Node 9 (1 connections): relabeled as 7
Node 0 (3 connections): relabeled as 6
Node 6 (2 connections): relabeled as 5
Node 4 (3 connections): relabeled as 4
Node 7 (4 connections): relabeled as 3
Node 3 (4 connections): relabeled as 2
Node 2 (7 connections): relabeled as 1

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 2): Forms triangle with nodes 2 and 8. Triangle <0, 2, 8>.
- Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (0, 8): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 2. Triangle <0, 2, 8>.
- Edge (1, 2): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 2. Triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (1, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 3): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 2. Triangle <0, 2, 3>.
- Edge (2, 4): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 2. Triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- Edge (3, 4): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 2. Triangle <0, 3, 4>.
- Edge (3, 8): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 2. Triangle <0, 3, 8>.
- Edge (3, 9): Forms triangle with nodes 7 and 9. Triangle <7, 9, 3>.
- Edge (4, 9): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 2. Triangle <0, 4, 9>.
- Edge (6, 7): Forms triangle with nodes 3 and 7. Triangle <3, 6, 7>.
- Edge (7, 8): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 2. Triangle <0, 7, 8>.
