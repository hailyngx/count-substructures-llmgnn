Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we have the following relabeling:

Node 3: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 2: Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
