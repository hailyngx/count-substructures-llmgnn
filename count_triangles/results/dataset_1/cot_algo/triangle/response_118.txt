Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the triangles efficiently.

We will first label the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 3 has degree 1
- Vertices 0, 3, 6, and 9 have degree 2
- Vertices 4, 8 have degree 4
- Vertices 1, 2, 5, and 7 have degree 5

Next, we will list the edges in increasing order of labels for the vertices:
(3, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 5) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 7) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by these edges:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle 4: <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle 5: <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle 6: <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle 7: <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle 8: <1, 7, 8>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
