Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 0>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
