Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then relabeling the vertices accordingly:

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now we analyze the edges based on the relabeled vertices:

1. (2, 0): No triangle.
2. (3, 0): No triangle.
3. (4, 0): Triangle <0, 4, 7>.
4. (5, 0): No triangle.
5. (8, 1): No triangle.
6. (9, 1): No triangle.
7. (3, 4): Triangle <3, 4, 7>.
8. (3, 5): Triangle <3, 5, 6>.
9. (3, 7): No triangle.
10. (3, 8): No triangle.
11. (4, 3): Already counted in edge 7 (3, 4).
12. (4, 7): No triangle.
13. (5, 3): Already counted in edge 8 (3, 5).
14. (6, 5): Triangle <3, 5, 6>.
15. (6, 7): No triangle.
16. (6, 9): Triangle <1, 6, 9>.
17. (7, 3): Already counted in edge 7 (3, 4).
18. (7, 4): Already counted in edge 7 (3, 4).
19. (7, 6): No triangle.
20. (8, 3): No triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 9>.
