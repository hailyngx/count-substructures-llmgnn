Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Steps to find the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Sort the vertices based on their degree:
   - Vertex 5 has degree 1
   - Vertices 0, 5, 6 have degree 2
   - Vertices 7, 3 have degree 3
   - Vertices 8, 1 have degree 4
   - Vertex 9 has degree 7
   - Vertex 2 has degree 5
2. Relabel the vertices based on their degree:
   - Vertex 5 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 0
   - Vertices 0, 4 (Degree 2) -> Vertex 1, 2
   - Vertices 7, 3 (Degree 3) -> Vertex 3, 4
   - Vertices 8, 1 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 5, 6
   - Vertex 9 (Degree 7) -> Vertex 7
   - Vertex 2 (Degree 5) -> Vertex 8
3. Check edges using the new labels:
   - Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <0, 1, 4>
   - Edge (0, 4) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (1, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <1, 4, 8>
   - Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle
   - Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle
4. Count the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 2
4. Output the total number of triangles inside brackets []:
   - [2]
5. List the unique triangles found inside <>:
   - <0, 1, 4>
   - <1, 4, 8>
