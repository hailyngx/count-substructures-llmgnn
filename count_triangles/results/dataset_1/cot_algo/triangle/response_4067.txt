Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following order: 3, 5, 1, 7, 2, 4, 6, 9, 0, 8.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method with this vertex order, we can count the triangles in the graph.

Calculating the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (3, 8, 9)
- Triangle 2: (4, 6, 9)

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles found: <3, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 9>.
