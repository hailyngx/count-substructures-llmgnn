Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
- Node 1 has 1 connection
- Node 0 has 1 connection
- Node 5 has 1 connection
- Node 6 has 1 connection
- Node 4 has 2 connections
- Node 7 has 3 connections
- Node 2 has 3 connections
- Node 8 has 4 connections
- Node 3 has 4 connections
- Node 9 has 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0 (1 connection) ↔ Node 8 (4 connections): No triangle
2. Node 1 (1 connection) ↔ Node 7 (3 connections): No triangle
3. Node 2 (3 connections) ↔ Node 7 (3 connections): No triangle
4. Node 2 (3 connections) ↔ Node 8 (4 connections): No triangle
5. Node 3 (4 connections) ↔ Node 4 (2 connections): No triangle
6. Node 3 (4 connections) ↔ Node 8 (4 connections): Triangle formed with Node 9 (6 connections): <3, 8, 9>
7. Node 3 (4 connections) ↔ Node 9 (6 connections): Triangle formed with Node 4 (2 connections): <3, 4, 9>
8. Node 4 (2 connections) ↔ Node 9 (6 connections): No triangle
9. Node 5 (1 connection) ↔ Node 6 (1 connection): No triangle
10. Node 5 (1 connection) ↔ Node 9 (6 connections): No triangle
11. Node 6 (1 connection) ↔ Node 9 (6 connections): No triangle
12. Node 7 (3 connections) ↔ Node 9 (6 connections): No triangle
13. Node 8 (4 connections) ↔ Node 9 (6 connections): Triangle formed with Node 3 (4 connections): <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <3, 4, 9> and <3, 8, 9>.
