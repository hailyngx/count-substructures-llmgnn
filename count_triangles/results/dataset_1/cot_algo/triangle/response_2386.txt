Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will construct a sorted list of vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices:
1. Node 9 (Degree: 1)
2. Node 1 (Degree: 2)
3. Node 5 (Degree: 1)
4. Node 4 (Degree: 2)
5. Node 2 (Degree: 1)
6. Node 7 (Degree: 4)
7. Node 6 (Degree: 4)
8. Node 3 (Degree: 3)
9. Node 0 (Degree: 5)
10. Node 8 (Degree: 9)

Next, we will go through each edge in the graph, ensuring that we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Then we will count the number of triangles formed:

Triangles: [14]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 0>
<7, 8, 3>
<7, 8, 6>
<7, 8, 4>
<8, 9, 8>
