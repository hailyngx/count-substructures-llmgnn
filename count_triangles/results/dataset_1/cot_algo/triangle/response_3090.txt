Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 1, 6, 0, 5, 9, 4, 3, 8, 2, 7

Next, we will relabel the vertices:
1(0), 6(1), 0(2), 5(3), 9(4), 4(5), 3(6), 8(7), 2(8), 7(9)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 1): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 7): Triangle <1, 2, 7> formed
- Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 1): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (4, 7): Triangle <1, 4, 7> formed
- Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 2): Triangle <1, 7, 8> formed
- Edge (7, 3): No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 4): No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 0): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (9, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 8>
