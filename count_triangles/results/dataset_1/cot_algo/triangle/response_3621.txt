Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degrees:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degree-based ordering:

Vertex 0 (degree 2) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 1 (degree 3) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 2 (degree 3) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 3 (degree 2) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 4 (degree 4) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 5 (degree 1) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 6 (degree 4) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 7 (degree 4) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 8 (degree 2) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 9 (degree 3) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will identify triangles based on shared connections:

- Triangle <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle <6, 4, 7>
- Triangle <8, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
