Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
Nodes in decreasing degree: 0, 8, 4, 9, 1, 5, 2, 7, 3, 6

The edges to consider following the degree-based ordering are:
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 7), (5, 8)

Counting the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle <0, 1, 3>
- Triangle <0, 8, 2>
- Triangle <0, 8, 5>
- Triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle <4, 5, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
