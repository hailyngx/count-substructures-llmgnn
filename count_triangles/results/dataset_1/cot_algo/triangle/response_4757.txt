Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method begins by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 6 connections
Vertex 7: 6 connections
Vertex 2: 6 connections

Now, we will check each edge starting with the vertex with the lower label and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

For edge (0, 2):
No triangles formed.

For edge (0, 3):
Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>

For edge (0, 4):
No triangles formed.

For edge (0, 5):
Triangle formed: <0, 6, 5>
Triangle formed: <0, 7, 5>

For edge (0, 7):
Triangle formed: <0, 2, 7>
Triangle formed: <0, 5, 7>
Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>

For edge (1, 7):
No triangles formed.

For edge (1, 8):
No triangles formed.

For edge (2, 3):
No triangles formed.

For edge (2, 6):
Triangle formed: <2, 9, 6>
Triangle formed: <2, 7, 6>

For edge (2, 8):
No triangles formed.

For edge (3, 0):
No triangles formed.

For edge (3, 2):

For edge (8, 1):
No triangles formed.

For edge (8, 2):
No triangles formed.

For edge (8, 6):
No triangles formed.

For edge (9, 6):
No triangles formed.

For edge (9, 7):
