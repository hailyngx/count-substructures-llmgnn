Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 3 has 1 connection.
Vertex 6 has 2 connections.
Vertices 2, 5, and 8 have 3 connections.
Vertices 7, 9, and 0 have 5 connections.
Vertex 1 has 6 connections.
Vertex 4 has 7 connections.

When considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
