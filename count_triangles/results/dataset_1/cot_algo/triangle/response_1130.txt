Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following connections:
Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9 (Degree 6)
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 9 (Degree 4)
Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8 (Degree 4)
Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7 (Degree 4)
Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (Degree 7)
Node 5: 1, 4 (Degree 2)
Node 6: 3, 4, 8 (Degree 3)
Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 9 (Degree 4)
Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 6 (Degree 4)
Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 7 (Degree 4)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will proceed to find the triangles.
