Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Node 0 has 1 connection.
Nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8 have 1 connection.
Node 4 has 0 connections.
Node 1 has 0 connections.
Node 7 has 0 connections.
Node 9 has 0 connections.
Node 2 has 6 connections.

Since the vertex with the lower label must have fewer connections for the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to focus on edges with nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 8 (with 1 connection) and node 2 (with 6 connections).

Now, we can analyze the shared connections between the lower labeled nodes and node 2 to count the triangles:

For edge (0, 2): Node 0 and node 2 share no common neighbors.
For edge (3, 2): Node 3 and node 2 share no common neighbors.
For edge (5, 2): Node 5 and node 2 share no common neighbors.
For edge (6, 2): Node 6 and node 2 share no common neighbors.
For edge (8, 2): Node 8 and node 2 share no common neighbors.

There are no triangles involving node 0, 3, 5, 6, or 8 with the current connection pattern.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 0 as there are no triangles formed among the given nodes.
