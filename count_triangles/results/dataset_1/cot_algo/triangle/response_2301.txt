Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, the graph with vertices sorted would be: 
Vertices: (2) (9) (3) (5) (8) (4) (7) (0) (1) (6)

Now, by following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles: 

Triangles: 
<1, 7, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
