Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have:
Nodes: 2, 3, 7, 10, 5, 4, 7, 0, 1, 8

Now, we start counting the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 4):
   - Node 0 has connections with nodes 4, 6, and 8;
   - Node 4 has connections with node 0.
   Hence, the triangle <0, 4, 6> is found.

2. Edge (0, 6):
   - Node 0 has connections with nodes 4, 6, and 8;
   - Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9.
   Hence, the triangles <0, 6, 4> and <0, 6, 5> are found.

3. Edge (0, 8):
   - Node 0 has connections with nodes 4, 6, and 8;
   - Node 8 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 9.
   Hence, the triangle <0, 8, 6> is found.

4. Edge (1, 6):
   - Node 1 has connections with nodes 6 and 8;
   - Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9.
   Hence, the triangle <1, 6, 9> is found.

5. Edge (1, 8):
   - Node 1 has connections with nodes 6 and 8;
   - Node 8 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 9.
   Hence, the triangle <1, 8, 6> is found.

6. Edge (6, 5):
   - Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9;
   - Node 5 has connections with node 6.
   Hence, the triangle <5, 6, 0> is found.

7. Edge (6, 9):
   - Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9;
   - Node 9 has connections with nodes 6, 8.
   Hence, the triangles <6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 8> are found.

8. Edge (8, 9):
   - Node 8 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 9;
   - Node 9 has connections with nodes 6, 8.
   Hence, the triangle <8, 9, 6> is found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
