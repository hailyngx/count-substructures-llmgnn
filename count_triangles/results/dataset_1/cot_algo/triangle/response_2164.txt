Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 1 (degree 0): 1
Node 2 (degree 0): 2
Node 3 (degree 1): 3
Node 4 (degree 3): 4
Node 5 (degree 5): 5
Node 6 (degree 3): 6
Node 7 (degree 2): 7
Node 8 (degree 0): 0
Node 9 (degree 0): 2
Node 10 (degree 0): 3

Next, we will list the edges based on the sorted nodes:

(1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 5) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 7) 

Now, we will count the triangles:

[Number of triangles: 1]
<3, 4, 5>
