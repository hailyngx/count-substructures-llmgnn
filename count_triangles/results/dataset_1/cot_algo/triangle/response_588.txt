Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 3

Now, let's relabel the vertices accordingly:

Node 0 -> 0
Node 6 -> 1
Node 5 -> 2
Node 4 -> 3
Node 9 -> 4
Node 3 -> 5
Node 7 -> 6
Node 8 -> 7
Node 2 -> 8
Node 1 -> 9

Now, based on the sorted labels, we check the edges for triangles:
  
(0, 2): Shared connection with node 4 -> Triangle <0, 2, 4>
(1, 4): Shared connection with node 2 -> Triangle <1, 4, 2>
(1, 5): No triangle
(1, 6): No triangle
(1, 7): Shared connection with node 3 -> Triangle <1, 7, 3>
(2, 4): Shared connection with node 0 and 9 -> Triangles <2, 4, 0> and <2, 4, 9>
(3, 1): No triangle
(3, 7): Shared connection with node 8 -> Triangle <3, 7, 8>
(3, 8): Shared connection with node 7 and 9 -> Triangles <3, 8, 7> and <3, 8, 9>
(5, 6): No triangle
(7, 8): Shared connection with node 3 and 9 -> Triangles <7, 8, 3> and <7, 8, 9>
(8, 9): Shared connection with node 2 and 3 -> Triangles <8, 9, 2> and <8, 9, 3>

Total number of triangles: [9]
