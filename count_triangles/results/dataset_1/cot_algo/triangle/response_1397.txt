Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order:

Vertices: 
0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 2)
2 (degree 2)
8 (degree 2)
3 (degree 3)
7 (degree 4)

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
0 → 0
1 → 1
2 → 2
8 → 3
3 → 4
7 → 5

Next, we will check the edges, starting from the edge with the lower labeled vertex:
(0, 7): 0 and 5 share a connection. No triangle.
(1, 3): 1 and 4 share a connection. No triangle.
(1, 7): 1 and 5 share a connection. No triangle.
(2, 3): 2 and 4 share a connection. No triangle.
(2, 8): 2 and 3 share a connection. No triangle.
(3, 1): 4 and 1 share a connection. No triangle.
(3, 2): 4 and 2 share a connection. No triangle.
(7, 0): 5 and 0 share a connection. No triangle.
(7, 1): 5 and 1 share a connection. No triangle.
(7, 8): 5 and 3 share a connection. No triangle.
(8, 2): 3 and 2 share a connection. No triangle.
(8, 7): 3 and 5 share a connection. Triangle formed with vertex 2. (2, 3, 8)

Total number of triangles: [1]

Unique triangles: <2, 3, 8>
