Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices sorted by their degree:

0: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
7: 1 connection
8: 1 connection
4: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
9: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
2: 4 connections

Now we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Start with the edge (0, 3): Both 0 and 3 have 2 connections.
2. Move to the edge (0, 4): Both 0 and 4 have 2 connections.
3. Move to the edge (1, 5): Both 1 and 5 have 2 connections.
4. Move to the edge (1, 6): Both 1 and 6 have 2 connections.
5. Move to the edge (2, 5): 2 has 4 connections, which is more than 5.
6. Move to the edge (2, 8): Both 2 and 8 have 1 connection.
7. Move to the edge (2, 9): 2 has 4 connections, which is more than 9.
8. Move to the edge (3, 9): 3 has 2 connections, which is fewer than 9. Shared connection with 0 forms a triangle <0, 3, 9>.
9. Move to the edge (4, 6): Both 4 and 6 have 2 connections.
10. Move to the edge (5, 7): Both 5 and 7 have 1 connection.
11. Move to the edge (5, 2): 5 has 4 connections, which is more than 2.
12. Move to the edge (5, 9): 5 has 4 connections, which is more than 9.
13. Move to the edge (6, 1): Both 6 and 1 have 2 connections.
14. Move to the edge (6, 4): Both 6 and 4 have 2 connections.
15. Move to the edge (9, 2): 9 has 3 connections, which is fewer than 2. Shared connection with 3 forms a triangle <3, 9, 2>.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles: <0, 3, 9>, <3, 9, 2>
