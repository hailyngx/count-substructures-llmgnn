Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree from least to most connections, the new labels for the vertices will be: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

The edges that we will consider are: (0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 6), (2, 3), (3, 8), (4, 5), (7, 9), (8, 9).

By examining these edges, we find the following triangles:
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
