Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  
Vertex 2 (Degree 1)  
Vertex 5 (Degree 1)  
Vertex 9 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 8 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 3 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 1 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 5 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 0 (Degree 5)  
Vertex 6 (Degree 5)  
Vertex 7 (Degree 5)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:  

Total number of triangles: [4]  
Unique triangles:  
<0, 6, 4>  
<0, 6, 1>  
<4, 0, 1>  
<0, 7, 8>
