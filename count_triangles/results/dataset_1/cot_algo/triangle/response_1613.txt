Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following list: 
Nodes with their sorted degree: 1(1), 8(1), 3(2), 6(2), 0(3), 9(3), 1(4), 7(4), 4(5), 2(6).

Now, looking at the edges and starting from the smallest degree node:
- (0, 2) forms a triangle with 4.
- (0, 8) does not form any triangles.
- (1, 7) does not form any triangles.
- (2, 4) forms a triangle with 5.
- (2, 5) forms a triangle with 4 and 7.
- (2, 7) forms a triangle with 4 and 5.
- (2, 9) forms a triangle with 3.
- (3, 5) forms a triangle with 9.
- (6, 4) forms a triangle with 5.
- (7, 1) does not form any triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 9, 3>, <3, 5, 9>, and <4, 6, 5>.
