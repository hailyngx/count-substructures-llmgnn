Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 1

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 1 (Degree 1) -> Node A
- Node 0 (Degree 2) -> Node B
- Node 5 (Degree 2) -> Node C
- Node 4 (Degree 3) -> Node D
- Node 6 (Degree 3) -> Node E
- Node 2 (Degree 4) -> Node F
- Node 3 (Degree 4) -> Node G
- Node 7 (Degree 4) -> Node H
- Node 8 (Degree 4) -> Node I
- Node 9 (Degree 1) -> Node J

Following the degree-based ordering, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (A, C): No triangles formed
2. (B, J): No triangles formed
3. (C, A): No triangles formed
4. (D, C): No triangles formed
5. (E, D): No triangles formed
6. (F, G): No triangles formed
7. (D, E): Triangle <D, E, G>
8. (C, D): No triangles formed
9. (E, F): No triangles formed
10. (D, F): No triangles formed
11. (J, B): No triangles formed
12. (F, G): No triangles formed
13. (D, G): No triangles formed
14. (C, G): No triangles formed
15. (E, I): No triangles formed
16. (F, H): No triangles formed
17. (F, I): No triangles formed
18. (H, G): No triangles formed
19. (B, I): No triangles formed
20. (I, F): No triangles formed
21. (H, G): No triangles formed
22. (H, I): No triangles formed
23. (I, G): Triangle <E, G, I>
24. (I, H): No triangles formed
25. (I, E): Triangle <D, E, I>
26. (J, B): No triangles formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <D, E, G> and <D, E, I>.
