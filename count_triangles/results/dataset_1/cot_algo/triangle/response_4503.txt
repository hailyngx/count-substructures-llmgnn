Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertex 3 has 1 connection.
Vertex 7 has 2 connections.
Vertices 2, 4, and 8 have 3 connections each.
Vertices 1, 6, and 9 have 4 connections each.
Vertex 5 has 5 connections.
Vertex 0 has 6 connections.

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degree in ascending order: 

Vertex 3 (degree 1) will be labeled as 0.
Vertex 7 (degree 2) will be labeled as 1.
Vertices 2, 4, and 8 (degree 3) will be labeled as 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
Vertices 1, 6, and 9 (degree 4) will be labeled as 5, 6, and 7 respectively.
Vertex 5 (degree 5) will be labeled as 8.
Vertex 0 (degree 6) will be labeled as 9.

Next, we will go through each edge, only proceeding if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will check for shared connections to find triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Finally, we count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 9>
