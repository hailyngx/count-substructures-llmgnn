Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 

Vertex 3 - Degree 2
Vertex 4 - Degree 2
Vertex 6 - Degree 2
Vertex 1 - Degree 3
Vertex 6 - Degree 3
Vertex 0 - Degree 4
Vertex 5 - Degree 4
Vertex 7 - Degree 4
Vertex 9 - Degree 4
Vertex 8 - Degree 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

1. (6, 8, 9)
2. (0, 2, 5)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
