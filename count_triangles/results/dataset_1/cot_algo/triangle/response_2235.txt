Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will determine the number of connections for each vertex to perform Degree-Based Ordering. Then we will sort the vertices accordingly:

- Vertex 0: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their number of connections in ascending order:
- Vertex 2 (1 connection)
- Vertex 4 (1 connection)
- Vertex 1 (2 connections)
- Vertex 3 (2 connections)
- Vertex 5 (2 connections)
- Vertex 6 (2 connections)
- Vertex 7 (2 connections)
- Vertex 8 (2 connections)
- Vertex 9 (2 connections)
- Vertex 0 (4 connections)

Next, we will follow the given edges and check for shared connections to count the number of triangles. The triangles are counted only once following the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 7>

Finally, we output the total number of triangles found in the graph:
