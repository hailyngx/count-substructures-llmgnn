Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will list the nodes and their respective degrees:
Node 0 - Degree: 2
Node 1 - Degree: 2
Node 2 - Degree: 2
Node 3 - Degree: 5
Node 4 - Degree: 3
Node 5 - Degree: 4
Node 6 - Degree: 5
Node 7 - Degree: 4
Node 8 - Degree: 1
Node 9 - Degree: 4

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Node 8 is the lowest degree node, so it will be labeled as 0.
Node 0 and Node 1 both have degree 2, but Node 0 appears first, so it will be labeled as 1 and Node 1 as 2.
Node 2 also has degree 2, so it will be labeled as 3.
Node 4 has degree 3, so it will be labeled as 4.
Node 7 and Node 5 both have degree 4, but Node 7 appears first, so it will be labeled as 5 and Node 5 as 6.
Node 9 and Node 6 both have degree 5, but Node 9 appears first, so it will be labeled as 7 and Node 6 as 8.
Node 3 has degree 5, so it will be labeled as 9.

Now, we will check for triangles using the given edges based on the Degree-Based Ordering:

1. (0, 2): No triangle.
2. (0, 4): No triangle.
3. (1, 3): No triangle.
4. (1, 9): No triangle.
5. (2, 0): No triangle.
6. (3, 1): No triangle.
7. (3, 5): No triangle.
8. (3, 7): Triangle formed: <3, 6, 7>.
9. (3, 8): No triangle.
10. (4, 0): No triangle.
11. (4, 6): No triangle.
12. (4, 7): Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>.
13. (5, 3): No triangle.
14. (5, 6): No triangle.
15. (5, 9): No triangle.
16. (6, 4): No triangle.
17. (6, 5): No triangle.
18. (6, 7): Triangle formed: <5, 6, 7>.
19. (6, 9): No triangle.
20. (7, 3): Triangle formed: <3, 5, 6>.
21. (7, 4): Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>.
22. (7, 6): Triangle formed: <3, 5, 6>.
23. (8, 3): No triangle.
24. (9, 1): No triangle.
25. (9, 5): No triangle.
26. (9, 6): No triangle.

Total number of triangles: [4]
