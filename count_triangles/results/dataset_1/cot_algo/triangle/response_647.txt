Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 1
- Node 5: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 0
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 5
- Node 7: Degree 5
- Node 9: Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with Node 7: <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (0, 7) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (1, 0) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle with Node 4: <1, 6, 4>
- Edge (1, 8) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 9) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (4, 6) forms a triangle with Node 7: <4, 6, 7>
- Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle with Nodes 1 and 6: <4, 7, 1> and <4, 7, 6>
- Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle with Nodes 1 and 6: <4, 9, 1> and <4, 9, 6>
- Edge (5, 4) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (6, 1) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (6, 4) forms a triangle with Node 7: <6, 4, 7>
- Edge (6, 7) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (6, 9) forms a triangle with Nodes 4 and 7: <6, 9, 4> and <6, 9, 7>
- Edge (7, 0) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (7, 4) forms a triangle with Nodes 1 and 6: <7, 4, 1> and <7, 4, 6>
- Edge (7, 5) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (7, 6) forms a triangle with Nodes 1 and 4: <7, 6, 1> and <7, 6, 4>
- Edge (7, 9) forms a triangle with Nodes 4 and 6: <7, 9, 4> and <7, 9, 6>
- Edge (8, 1) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (8, 9) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 3) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 4) forms a triangle with Node 7: <9, 4, 7>
- Edge (9, 6) forms a triangle with Node 7: <9, 6, 7>
- Edge (9, 7) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 8) does not form any triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <1, 6, 4>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 9, 1>, <4, 9, 6>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 9, 4>, <6, 9, 7>, <7, 4, 1>, <7, 4, 6>, <7, 9, 4>, <7, 9, 6>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 6, 7>.
