Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have the following relabeling: 

Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 5: 2 connections  
Node 6: 2 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 7: 5 connections  
Node 0: 5 connections  
Node 2: 6 connections  
Node 8: 6 connections  
Node 9: 6 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with node 7: <0, 3, 7>
2. Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle with node 4: <0, 8, 4>
3. Edge (0, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
5. Edge (1, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
7. Edge (2, 6) doesn't form a triangle.
8. Edge (2, 7) forms a triangle with node 0: <2, 7, 0>
9. Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle with node 4: <2, 8, 4>
10. Edge (2, 9) forms a triangle with node 3: <2, 9, 3>
11. Edge (3, 7) doesn't form a triangle.
12. Edge (4, 5) doesn't form a triangle.
13. Edge (4, 8) forms a triangle with node 0: <4, 8, 0>
14. Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle with node 2: <4, 9, 2>
15. Edge (5, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
16. Edge (6, 7) doesn't form a triangle.

Thus, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles are <0, 3, 7>, <0, 8, 4>, <2, 7, 0>, <2, 8, 4>, and <2, 9, 3>.
