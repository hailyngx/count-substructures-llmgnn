Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
(4, 3, 1, 7, 8, 5, 9, 2, 6, 0)

Based on the degree-based ordering, we start counting triangles.

Triangles:
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [11]
