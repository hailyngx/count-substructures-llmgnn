Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method is as follows:

Node 0 has 7 connections.
Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 6 connections.
Node 8 has 1 connection.
Node 9 has 5 connections.

Sorting the nodes in ascending order based on their connections:
Nodes 8, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 7, 0.

Based on the sorted order, we process the edges:

1. Edge between 0 and 1: Both nodes have a degree that satisfies the conditions. They share node 7 forming a triangle <0, 1, 7>.
2. Edge between 0 and 2: Both nodes have a degree that satisfies the conditions. They share node 5 forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
3. Edge between 0 and 3: Both nodes have a degree that satisfies the conditions.
4. Edge between 0 and 4: Node 0 has a lower degree and shares nodes 5 and 7 with node 4 forming two triangles <0, 4, 5> and <0, 4, 7>.
5. Edge between 0 and 5: Node 0 has a lower degree and shares nodes 2, 4, and 7 forming three triangles <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, and <0, 5, 7>.
6. Edge between 0 and 7: Node 0 has a lower degree and shares nodes 1, 4, and 5 forming three triangles <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, and <0, 5, 7>.
7. Edge between 0 and 9: Node 0 has a lower degree and shares nodes 3 and 4 forming two triangles <0, 3, 9> and <0, 4, 9>.
8. Edge between 1 and 7: Node 1 has a lower degree.
9. Edge between 1 and 9: Node 1 has a lower degree.
10. Edge between 2 and 3: Both nodes have a degree that satisfies the conditions.
11. Edge between 2 and 5: Node 2 has a lower degree.
12. Edge between 2 and 7: Node 2 has a lower degree.
13. Edge between 3 and 6: Both nodes have a degree that satisfies the conditions. They share node 8 forming a triangle <3, 6, 8>.
14. Edge between 3 and 9: Node 3 has a lower degree and shares nodes 0 and 4 forming a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
15. Edge between 4 and 5: Node 4 has a lower degree and shares nodes 0, 5, and 7 forming three triangles <0, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, and <0, 5, 7>.
16. Edge between 4 and 7: Node 4 has a lower degree and shares nodes 0, 5, and 7 forming three triangles <0, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, and <0, 5, 7>.
17. Edge between 5 and 7: Node 5 has a lower degree.
18. Edge between 6 and 8: Both nodes have a degree that satisfies the conditions.
19. Edge between 7 and 9: Node 7 has a lower degree.

Count of triangles = 1 (from edge 3 and 6)
