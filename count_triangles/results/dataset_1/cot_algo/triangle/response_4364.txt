Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and labeling the vertices accordingly, we have:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 7: 6 connections
- Node 2: 7 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:
- For the edge (0, 2): Triangle formed with node 7. Triangle is <0, 2, 7>.
- For the edge (0, 7): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (0, 8): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (1, 2): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (2, 0): Triangle formed with node 7. Triangle is <0, 2, 7>.
- For the edge (2, 1): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (2, 4): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (2, 7): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (2, 8): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (2, 9): Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 6. Triangles are <2, 4, 6> and <2, 6, 9>.
- For the edge (3, 7): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (3, 9): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (4, 2): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (4, 5): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (4, 6): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (4, 9): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (5, 4): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (5, 7): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (6, 4): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (6, 7): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (6, 8): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (6, 9): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (7, 0): Triangle formed with node 2. Triangle is <0, 2, 7>.
- For the edge (7, 2): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (7, 3): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (7, 5): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (7, 6): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (7, 8): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (8, 0): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (8, 2): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (8, 6): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (8, 7): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (9, 2): Triangle formed with nodes 4 and 6. Triangles are <2, 4, 6> and <2, 6, 9>.
- For the edge (9, 3): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (9, 4): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (9, 6): No triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
