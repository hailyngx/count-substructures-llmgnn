Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are as follows: 

Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 1
Node 4: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 3: degree 0
Node 5: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 9: degree 5

Using these labels, we can identify the triangles formed in the graph:

- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <0, 7, 9>
- Triangle <1, 9, 0>
- Triangle <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle <4, 6, 5>
- Triangle <5, 7, 9>
- Triangle <5, 8, 7>
- Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
