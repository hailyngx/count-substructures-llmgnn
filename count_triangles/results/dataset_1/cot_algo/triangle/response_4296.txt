Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections.

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection

Sorted nodes: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 2, 7, 5, 3

Now, we will iterate through the edges in the graph. Count triangles by checking shared connections between nodes only when the edge connects a lower labeled node to a higher labeled node.

Calculating the triangles:
1. (0, 5): No triangle
2. (1, 2): No triangle
3. (2, 8): No triangle
4. (3, 4): No triangle
5. (3, 5): No triangle
6. (3, 6): No triangle
7. (3, 7): Triangle <3, 5, 7>
8. (3, 7): No triangle
9. (5, 0): No triangle
10. (5, 3): Triangle <3, 5, 7>
11. (5, 7): Triangle <3, 5, 7>
12. (5, 9): No triangle
13. (7, 3): Triangle <3, 5, 7>
14. (7, 5): Triangle <3, 5, 7>
15. (2, 1): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [3]
