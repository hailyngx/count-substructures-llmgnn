Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the relabeling of vertices is: 
Vertex 1 has 1 connection.  
Vertex 6 has 2 connections.  
Vertices 0, 1, and 3 have 4 connections.  
Vertices 5 and 7 have 5 connections.  
Vertices 2, 4, and 8 have 6 connections.  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 3, 4>  
<0, 4, 5>  
<2, 4, 8>  
<2, 5, 7>  
<5, 6, 7>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
