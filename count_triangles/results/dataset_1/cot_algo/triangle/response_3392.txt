Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:  
Node 3: 1 connection  
Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 5: 1 connection  
Node 6: 1 connection  
Node 7: 1 connection  
Node 8: 1 connection  
Node 9: 1 connection  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  

Edges to consider based on the method:  
(0, 2)  
(0, 5)  
(0, 6)  
(1, 4)  
(2, 4)  
(2, 7)  
(4, 8)  

Calculating the triangles formed:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>  
2. Triangle <0, 2, 7>  

Total number of triangles: [2]
