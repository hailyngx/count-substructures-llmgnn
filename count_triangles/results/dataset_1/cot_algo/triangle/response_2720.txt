Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, the relabeling of the nodes is as follows: 
Node 2 has 2 edges
Node 5 has 2 edges
Node 8 has 1 edges
Node 0 has 4 edges
Node 4 has 4 edges
Node 7 has 4 edges
Node 6 has 5 edges
Node 1 has 6 edges
Node 3 has 6 edges
Node 9 has 7 edges

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
