Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 7 has 0 connection(s).
Node 4 has 1 connection(s).
Node 9 has 2 connection(s).
Node 2 has 2 connection(s).
Node 3 has 2 connection(s).
Node 6 has 2 connection(s).
Node 1 has 3 connection(s).
Node 5 has 3 connection(s).
Node 0 has 4 connection(s).
Node 8 has 5 connection(s).

The sorted vertices are: 7, 4, 9, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 0, 8. 

Based on the connections, the triangles in the graph are:
- <1, 8, 5>
- <1, 8, 6>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
