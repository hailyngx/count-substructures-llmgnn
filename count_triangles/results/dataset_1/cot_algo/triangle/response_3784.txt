Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling: 

Vertex 0 has 1 connection
Vertex 2 has 1 connection
Vertex 5 has 1 connection
Vertex 8 has 1 connection
Vertex 6 has 2 connections
Vertex 7 has 2 connections
Vertex 1 has 3 connections
Vertex 4 has 3 connections
Vertex 3 has 5 connections
Vertex 9 has 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles based on this degree-based ordering:

1. Edge (0, 7): No triangle.
2. Edge (1, 4): No triangle.
3. Edge (1, 8): No triangle.
4. Edge (1, 9): Triangle <1, 8, 9>.
5. Edge (2, 6): No triangle.
6. Edge (3, 4): No triangle.
7. Edge (3, 5): No triangle.
8. Edge (3, 6): Triangle <3, 6, 9>.
9. Edge (3, 8): No triangle.
10. Edge (3, 9): No additional triangle (already counted above).
11. Edge (4, 7): No triangle.
12. Edge (4, 9): Triangle <4, 7, 9>.
13. Edge (5, 9): No triangle.
14. Edge (6, 9): No additional triangle (already counted above).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 3, and the unique triangles are <1, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>. 

Final output: [3]
