Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get: 

Vertices: 7, 6, 2, 9, 3, 5, 8, 1, 0, 4

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 7>
<4, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
