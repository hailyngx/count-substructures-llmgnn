Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 1: 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:
(0, 1) shares connections with: (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (4, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8)
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
(0, 2) shares connections with: (2, 4), (2, 8)
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
(0, 3) shares connections with: (3, 2)
<0, 3, 2>
(0, 4) shares connections with: (4, 8)
<0, 4, 8>
(0, 6) shares connections with: (6, 8)
<0, 6, 8>
(0, 7) shares connections with: (7, 8)
<0, 7, 8>
(0, 8) shares connections with: (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7)
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 6>
<0, 8, 7>

Total number of triangles: [13]
