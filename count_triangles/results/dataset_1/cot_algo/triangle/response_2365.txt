Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The vertices in this graph can be sorted as follows:

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 2: 7 connections

Now, we will check for triangles while considering edges with the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:

1. Edge (1, 7) - Node 1 has 2 connections and Node 7 has 4 connections. No triangle.
2. Edge (1, 8) - Node 1 has 2 connections and Node 8 has 3 connections. No triangle.
3. Edge (2, 5) - Node 2 has 7 connections and Node 5 has 6 connections. Node 5 shares connections with Node 6 and Node 4, forming a triangle <2, 5, 6>.
4. Edge (2, 6) - Node 2 has 7 connections and Node 6 has 2 connections. No triangle.
5. Edge (2, 8) - Node 2 has 7 connections and Node 8 has 3 connections. Node 2 shares connections with Node 1, forming a triangle <1, 2, 8>.
6. Edge (2, 9) - Node 2 has 7 connections and Node 9 has 3 connections. No triangle.
7. Edge (3, 5) - Node 3 has 4 connections and Node 5 has 6 connections. No triangle.
8. Edge (3, 7) - Node 3 has 4 connections and Node 7 has 4 connections. No triangle.
9. Edge (4, 5) - Node 4 has 2 connections and Node 5 has 6 connections. No triangle.
10. Edge (4, 8) - Node 4 has 2 connections and Node 8 has 3 connections. No triangle.
11. Edge (5, 2) - Node 5 has 6 connections and Node 2 has 7 connections. No triangle.
12. Edge (5, 3) - Node 5 has 6 connections and Node 3 has 4 connections. No triangle.
13. Edge (5, 4) - Node 5 has 6 connections and Node 4 has 2 connections. No triangle.
14. Edge (5, 6) - Node 5 has 6 connections and Node 6 has 2 connections. No triangle.
15. Edge (6, 2) - Node 6 has 2 connections and Node 2 has 7 connections. No triangle.
16. Edge (6, 5) - Node 6 has 2 connections and Node 5 has 6 connections. No triangle.
17. Edge (7, 1) - Node 7 has 4 connections and Node 1 has 2 connections. No triangle.
18. Edge (7, 3) - Node 7 has 4 connections and Node 3 has 4 connections. Node 7 shares connections with Node 9, forming a triangle <3, 7, 9>.
19. Edge (7, 9) - Node 7 has 4 connections and Node 9 has 3 connections. No triangle.
20. Edge (8, 1) - Node 8 has 3 connections and Node 1 has 2 connections. No triangle.
21. Edge (8, 2) - Node 8 has 3 connections and Node 2 has 7 connections. No triangle.
22. Edge (8, 4) - Node 8 has 3 connections and Node 4 has 2 connections. No triangle.
23. Edge (9, 2) - Node 9 has 3 connections and Node 2 has 7 connections. No triangle.
24. Edge (9, 7) - Node 9 has 3 connections and Node 7 has 4 connections. No triangle.

There are 2 unique triangles: <1, 2, 8> and <3, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
