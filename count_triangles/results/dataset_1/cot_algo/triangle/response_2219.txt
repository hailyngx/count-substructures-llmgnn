Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 3: 0 connections
Vertex 8: 0 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can find the number of triangles in the graph:
- For the edge (0, 4): shared connections with 7
- For the edge (0, 7): shared connections with 4
- For the edge (0, 9): no triangles
- For the edge (1, 2): no triangles
- For the edge (1, 4): shared connections with 7
- For the edge (1, 5): no triangles
- For the edge (2, 3): no triangles
- For the edge (2, 7): shared connections with 0 and 4
- For the edge (3, 5): no triangles
- For the edge (4, 6): no triangles
- For the edge (4, 7): shared connections with 0 and 2
- For the edge (5, 3): no triangles
- For the edge (6, 9): no triangles
- For the edge (7, 8): no triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 0>
