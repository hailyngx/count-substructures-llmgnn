Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 1 (Degree 0): 1
Node 7 (Degree 0): 2
Node 9 (Degree 0): 3
Node 5 (Degree 1): 4
Node 3 (Degree 2): 5
Node 7 (Degree 2): 6
Node 0 (Degree 3): 7
Node 2 (Degree 4): 8
Node 4 (Degree 4): 9
Node 6 (Degree 4): 10

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can proceed to count the number of triangles in the graph. The triangles are as follows:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
