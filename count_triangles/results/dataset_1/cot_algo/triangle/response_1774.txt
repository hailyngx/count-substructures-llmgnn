Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices with their degrees:  
0: 3  
1: 3  
4: 3  
7: 3  
5: 4  
8: 4  
9: 4  
6: 4  
2: 5  
3: 5  

Next, let's count the number of triangles:

For each edge, we will only consider pairs where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Edge (0, 3):  
0 and 3 do not share connections with any other vertices, so no triangles.

Edge (0, 5):  
0 shares connections with 3 and 6.  
3 shares connections with 1, 2.  
In this case, there is one triangle: <0, 3, 5>.

Edge (0, 6):  
0 shares connections with 3 and 5.  
3 shares connections with 1, 2.  
In this case, there are two triangles: <0, 3, 6> and <0, 5, 6>.

... (continue for all edges)

After considering all edges, the total number of triangles is 8.

Therefore, the answer is: [8]
