Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 3: degree 0
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The triangles formed by the given graph are:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <1, 9, 0>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 7, 4>
- <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
