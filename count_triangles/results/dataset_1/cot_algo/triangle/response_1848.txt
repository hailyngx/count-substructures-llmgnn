Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we relabel the nodes as follows:
Vertices: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 4

Calculating the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

For edge (0, 1):
Vertex 0 has connections with: 1, 2
Vertex 1 has connections with: 0, 7, 8
Shared connections: 1
Triangle found: <0, 1, 7>

For edge (0, 2):
Vertex 0 has connections with: 1, 2
Vertex 2 has connections with: 0, 3, 4
Shared connections: 1
Triangle found: <0, 2, 4>

For edge (1, 7):
Vertex 1 has connections with: 0, 7, 8
Vertex 7 has connections with: 1, 4
Shared connections: 1
Triangle found: <1, 7, 4>

For edge (1, 8):
Vertex 1 has connections with: 0, 7, 8
Vertex 8 has connections with: 1, 3
Shared connections: 1
Triangle found: <1, 8, 3>

For edge (2, 0):
Vertex 2 has connections with: 0, 3, 4
Vertex 0 has connections with: 1, 2
Shared connections: 1
Triangle found: <2, 0, 1>

For edge (2, 3):
