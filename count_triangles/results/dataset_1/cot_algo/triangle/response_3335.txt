Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
0: 1 connection
5: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
6: 5 connections
2: 5 connections
7: 5 connections

Now, we go through each edge in the graph and count the triangles formed:

- Edge (0, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (1, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (1, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (1, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (2, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (2, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (2, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (2, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (3, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (3, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (4, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (4, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (5, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (6, 2): Triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>
- Edge (6, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (6, 7): Triangle formed: <2, 6, 7>
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (7, 0): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (7, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (7, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (7, 6): Triangle formed: <2, 6, 7>
- Edge (8, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (9, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (9, 2): Triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>
- Edge (9, 6): Triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles:
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
