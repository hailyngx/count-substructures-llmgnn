Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices from least to most connections: 3, 1, 9, 5, 6, 4, 7, 8, 2, 0

Now, let's relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 3 with 0 connections is now labeled as 0
Vertex 1 with 1 connection is now labeled as 1
Vertex 9 with 1 connection is now labeled as 2
Vertex 5 with 2 connections is now labeled as 3
Vertex 6 with 2 connections is now labeled as 4
Vertex 4 with 3 connections is now labeled as 5
Vertex 7 with 4 connections is now labeled as 6
Vertex 8 with 5 connections is now labeled as 7
Vertex 2 with 6 connections is now labeled as 8
Vertex 0 with 6 connections is now labeled as 9

Let's go through each edge and count the triangles:
(0, 2) is not considered as vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 2
(0, 3) is not considered as vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 3
(0, 4) forms a triangle with vertex 6: <4, 5, 6>
(0, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 6: <4, 5, 6>
(0, 9) is not considered as vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 9
(1, 2) is not considered as vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 2
(1, 7) is not considered as vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 7
(1, 8) forms triangles with vertices 6 and 7: <1, 7, 8>
(2, 0) is not considered as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 0
(2, 1) is not considered as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 1
(2, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 6: <5, 6, 8>
(2, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 6: <1, 6, 8>
(3, 0) is not considered as vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 0
(3, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <3, 4, 5>
(3, 9) is not considered as vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 9
(4, 0) is not considered as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 0
(4, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <1, 5, 6>
(4, 8) forms triangles with vertices 1 and 6: <1, 5, 6> and <5, 6, 7>
(5, 0) is not considered as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 0
(5, 2) is not considered as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 2
(5, 6) is not considered as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 6
(6, 3) is not considered as vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 3
(6, 5) is not considered as vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 5
(6, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <1, 5, 6>
(7, 1) is not considered as vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 1
(7, 4) forms a triangle with vertex 1: <1, 5, 6>
(7, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 1: <1, 5, 6>
(7, 8) forms triangles with vertices 1 and 5: <1, 5, 6> and <5, 6, 7>
(8, 1) is not considered as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 1
(8, 2) is not considered as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 2
(8, 4) forms a triangle with vertex 1: <1, 5, 6>
(8, 7) forms triangles with vertices 1 and 5: <1, 5, 6> and <5, 6, 7>
(8, 9) is not considered as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 9
(9, 0) is not considered as vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 0
(9, 3) is not considered as vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 3
(9, 8) is not considered as vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 8

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles found: <1, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 5>, <1, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 8>
