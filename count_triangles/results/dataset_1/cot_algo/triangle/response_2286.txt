Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 6
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
- Node 5 (degree 1) becomes node 0
- Nodes 0, 1, and 2 (degree 2) become nodes 1, 2, and 3 respectively
- Nodes 8 and 9 (degree 2) become nodes 4 and 5 respectively
- Nodes 3 and 7 (degree 4) become nodes 6 and 7 respectively
- Node 6 (degree 5) becomes node 8
- Node 4 (degree 6) becomes node 9

Using the degree-based ordering method, we look at the edges:
1. Edge between nodes 0 (5) and 3 (6):
   - Node 0 has one connection: Node 3
   - Node 3 has four connections: Node 0, 5, 6, and 7
   - The shared neighbor is node 6
2. Edge between nodes 0 (5) and 4 (9):
   - Node 0 has one connection: Node 4
   - Node 4 has six connections: Node 0, 1, 6, 8, 9, and 6
   - The shared neighbors are nodes 6 and 9
3. Edge between nodes 1 (2) and 4 (9):
   - Node 1 has two connections: Node 4 and 7
   - Node 4 has six connections: Node 0, 1, 6, 8, 9, and 6
   - The shared neighbor is node 9
4. Edge between nodes 2 (3) and 6 (8):
   - Node 2 has two connections: Node 6 and 7
   - Node 6 has five connections: Node 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8
   - The shared neighbor is node 8
5. Edge between nodes 3 (6) and 6 (8):
   - Node 3 has four connections: Node 0, 5, 6, and 7
   - Node 6 has five connections: Node 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8
   - The shared neighbor is node 8
6. Edge between nodes 3 (6) and 4 (9):
   - Node 3 has four connections: Node 0, 5, 6, and 7
   - Node 4 has six connections: Node 0, 1, 6, 8, 9, and 6
   - The shared neighbors are nodes 6 and 9
7. Edge between nodes 4 (9) and 6 (8):
   - Node 4 has six connections: Node 0, 1, 6, 8, 9, and 6
   - Node 6 has five connections: Node 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8
   - The shared neighbor is node 8

Therefore, there are a total of 7 triangles in the graph:
[7]

And the unique triangles are:
<0, 6, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>
