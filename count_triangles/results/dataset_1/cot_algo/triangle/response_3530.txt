Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Nodes: 4 0 7 6 5 3 9 8 1 2

Using the degree-based ordering method, we find the following triangles:
[3]

<3, 0, 5>
<3, 0, 8>
<3, 0, 9>
<3, 6, 5>
<3, 6, 8>
<5, 0, 8>
<5, 0, 1>
<5, 0, 2>
<5, 0, 6>
<5, 0, 7>
<6, 3, 8>
<8, 1, 2>
<8, 1, 5>
<8, 1, 6>
<8, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [3].
