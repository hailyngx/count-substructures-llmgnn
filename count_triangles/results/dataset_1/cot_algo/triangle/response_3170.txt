Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow these steps:

1. Degree-Based Ordering:
- The degrees of the nodes are: 
    - Node 0: 2 connections
    - Node 1: 2 connections
    - Node 2: 6 connections
    - Node 3: 3 connections
    - Node 4: 1 connection
    - Node 5: 4 connections
    - Node 6: 2 connections
    - Node 7: 2 connections
    - Node 8: 2 connections
    - Node 9: 2 connections

- Sorting the nodes by their degree in increasing order:
    - Nodes 4, 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3, 5, 2

2. Analyzing the edges:
- We will only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
    - (0, 7)
    - (1, 5)
    - (1, 9)
    - (4, 2)
    - (6, 8)

3. Calculating the triangles:
- Triangle <1, 5, 2> (shared connection: 5)
- Triangle <1, 9, 2> (shared connection: 9)

4. Output:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
