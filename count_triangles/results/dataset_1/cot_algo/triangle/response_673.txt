Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 0 has degree 3
Vertex 1 has degree 4
Vertex 2 has degree 1
Vertex 3 has degree 2
Vertex 4 has degree 2
Vertex 5 has degree 1
Vertex 6 has degree 2
Vertex 7 has degree 3
Vertex 8 has degree 4
Vertex 9 has degree 4

Now, we'll relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 2 -> 0
Vertex 5 -> 1
Vertex 3 -> 2
Vertex 4 -> 3
Vertex 6 -> 4
Vertex 0 -> 5
Vertex 7 -> 6
Vertex 8 -> 7
Vertex 1 -> 8
Vertex 9 -> 9

Next, we'll examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Checking (0, 1): Forming a triangle with 7 -> <0, 1, 7>
Checking (0, 7): Forming a triangle with 1 -> <0, 7, 1>
Checking (0, 8): No triangles
Checking (1, 0): No triangles
Checking (1, 2): No triangles
Checking (1, 7): No triangles
Checking (1, 8): Forming a triangle with 0 -> <1, 8, 0>
Checking (3, 6): No triangles
Checking (3, 9): No triangles
Checking (4, 7): Forming a triangle with 8 -> <4, 7, 8>
Checking (4, 8): No triangles
Checking (5, 9): No triangles
Checking (7, 0): No triangles
Checking (7, 1): No triangles
Checking (7, 4): Forming a triangle with 8 -> <7, 4, 8>
Checking (8, 0): Forming a triangle with 1 -> <8, 0, 1>
Checking (8, 1): Forming a triangle with 0 -> <8, 1, 0>
Checking (8, 4): Forming a triangle with 7 -> <8, 4, 7>
Checking (8, 9): Forming a triangle with 4 -> <8, 9, 4>
Checking (9, 3): Forming a triangle with 6 -> <9, 3, 6>
Checking (9, 5): No triangles
Checking (9, 6): No triangles
Checking (9, 8): Forming a triangle with 4 -> <9, 8, 4>

Total number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 8, 0>
<4, 7, 8>
<9, 3, 6>
<8, 0, 1>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 9, 4>
