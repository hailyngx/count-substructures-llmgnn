Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). 

The sorted vertices are: 
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 0, 2, 8: 2 connections
Node 4, 9: 3 connections
Node 1, 5: 4 connections
Node 3, 6: 6 connections

We will now consider the edges starting from nodes with lower degrees to higher degrees.

Using the given edges and the degree-based ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

Triangles:

Unique Triangles: 
<3, 5, 6>
