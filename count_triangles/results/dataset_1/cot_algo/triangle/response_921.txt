Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
