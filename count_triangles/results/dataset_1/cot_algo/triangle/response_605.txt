Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 0 -> 0
Vertex 7 -> 1
Vertex 5 -> 2
Vertex 1 -> 3
Vertex 4 -> 4
Vertex 3 -> 5
Vertex 6 -> 6

Now, we will list the edges in the correct order based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
(0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7)

Now, we will check for triangles among these edges:
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<4, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
