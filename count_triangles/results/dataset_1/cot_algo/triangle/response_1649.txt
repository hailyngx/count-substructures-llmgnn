Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each vertex has:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 6 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 0 (3 connections) -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 3 (2 connections) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 7 (2 connections) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 9 (2 connections) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 8 (3 connections) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 1 (4 connections) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 2 (4 connections) -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 4 (4 connections) -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 5 (4 connections) -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 6 (6 connections) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): Vertex 0, 2 have 3 common neighbors - Vertex 4, 5, 6
- Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0, 4 have 3 common neighbors - Vertex 2, 5, 6
- Edge (0, 5): Vertex 0, 5 have 2 common neighbors - Vertex 2, 6
- Edge (1, 2): No triangles
- Edge (1, 4): Vertex 1, 4 have 2 common neighbors - Vertex 6, 8
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles
- Edge (1, 9): No triangles
- Edge (2, 3): No triangles
- Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2, 6 have 2 common neighbors - Vertex 4, 5
- Edge (3, 5): No triangles
- Edge (4, 6): Vertex 4, 6 have 2 common neighbors - Vertex 0, 5
- Edge (4, 7): No triangles
- Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5, 8 have 2 common neighbors - Vertex 0, 6
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles

Count of triangles: 2
Triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
