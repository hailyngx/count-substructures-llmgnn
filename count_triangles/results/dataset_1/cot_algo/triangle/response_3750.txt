Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by their number of connections (degree):
Node 5, Node 6, Node 9, Node 3, Node 4, Node 1, Node 0, Node 5, Node 2, Node 8, Node 7

Edges to consider based on the method:
(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (4, 1), (8, 1), (5, 8), (6, 8), (9, 7)

Calculating the count of triangles using the shared connections:
- Triangle <1, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 2, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
