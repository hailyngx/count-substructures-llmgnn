Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 2

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 5 (degree 1) becomes Node 0
- Node 6 (degree 1) becomes Node 1
- Node 7 (degree 1) becomes Node 2
- Node 9 (degree 2) becomes Node 3
- Node 3 (degree 3) becomes Node 4
- Node 0 (degree 3) becomes Node 5
- Node 2 (degree 4) becomes Node 6
- Node 4 (degree 5) becomes Node 7
- Node 1 (degree 5) becomes Node 8
- Node 8 (degree 5) becomes Node 9

The new edge list after relabeling is as follows:
(0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Node 0 (5) - Node 1 (8) - Node 3 (4) form a triangle <0, 1, 3>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 1, 3>.
