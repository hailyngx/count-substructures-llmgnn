Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
Vertex 6 has 0 connections.
Vertices 1, 2, 4, and 9 have 1 connection each.
Vertices 3 and 7 have 2 connections each.
Vertices 0 and 5 have 5 connections each.
Vertex 8 has 7 connections.

2. Relabel the vertices based on the sorted order:
Vertex 6 --> 0
Vertices 1, 2, 4, and 9 --> 1
Vertices 3 and 7 --> 2
Vertices 0 and 5 --> 3
Vertex 8 --> 4

3. List the edges that can form triangles following the requirement that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (0, 1): Forms a triangle with vertex 3.
- (0, 3): Forms a triangle with vertices 1 and 5.
- (0, 4): No triangles can be formed as vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 4.
- (0, 5): Forms a triangle with vertices 1 and 3.
- (1, 2): No triangles can be formed as vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 2.
- (1, 8): No triangles can be formed as vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 8.
- (2, 5): No triangles can be formed as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 5.
- (3, 8): No triangles can be formed as vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 8.
- (4, 0): No triangles can be formed as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 0.
- (4, 8): No triangles can be formed as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 8.
- (5, 2): No triangles can be formed as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 2.
- (5, 7): No triangles can be formed as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 7.
- (5, 8): Forms a triangle with vertices 0 and 7.
- (7, 0): Forms a triangle with vertex 5.
- (7, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 8.
- (7, 8): No triangles can be formed as vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 8.
- (8, 1): Forms a triangle with vertex 3.
- (8, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 0.
- (8, 4): No triangles can be formed as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 4.
- (8, 5): Forms a triangle with vertices 0 and 7.
- (8, 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 5.
- (8, 9): No triangles can be formed as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 9.

Thus, there are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 7>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 1, 3>, <3, 5, 8>, <0, 1, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, and <1, 3, 8>.
