Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:
(3) - 0 connections
(6) - 0 connections
(8) - 1 connection
(9) - 2 connections
(4) - 2 connections
(5) - 2 connections
(0) - 3 connections
(1) - 4 connections
(7) - 4 connections
(2) - 5 connections

Next, we relabel the vertices:
(3) - 0
(6) - 1
(8) - 2
(9) - 3
(4) - 4
(5) - 5
(0) - 6
(1) - 7
(7) - 8
(2) - 9

Now, we will go through each edge and check for triangles:
For edge (0, 1): No triangle is formed.
For edge (0, 2): Triangle <0, 1, 2> is formed.
For edge (0, 5): No triangle is formed.
For edge (1, 2): No triangle is formed.
For edge (1, 8): No triangle is formed.
For edge (1, 9): Triangle <1, 2, 9> is formed.
For edge (2, 4): No triangle is formed.
For edge (2, 7): Triangle <1, 2, 7> is formed.
For edge (2, 9): Triangle <1, 2, 9> is formed.
For edge (3, 7): No triangle is formed.
For edge (4, 2): No triangle is formed.
For edge (4, 6): No triangle is formed.
For edge (5, 0): No triangle is formed.
For edge (5, 7): No triangle is formed.
For edge (6, 4): No triangle is formed.
For edge (7, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 7> is formed.
For edge (7, 3): No triangle is formed.
For edge (7, 5): No triangle is formed.
For edge (8, 1): No triangle is formed.
For edge (9, 1): Triangle <0, 1, 9> is formed.
For edge (9, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 9> is formed.

Count of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 7>
