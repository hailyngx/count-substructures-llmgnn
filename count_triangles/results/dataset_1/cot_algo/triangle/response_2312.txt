Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 7 (1 connection): 3
Node 2 (1 connection): 6
Node 3 (1 connection): 7
Node 6 (2 connections): 2
Node 1 (2 connections): 8
Node 0 (4 connections): 0
Node 5 (4 connections): 4
Node 8 (4 connections): 5
Node 9 (4 connections): 9
Node 4 (5 connections): 1

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles: 
[Total number of triangles: 8]
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 9, 3>
<4, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 2>
