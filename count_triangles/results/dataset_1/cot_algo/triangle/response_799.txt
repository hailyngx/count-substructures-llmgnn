Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's first sort the vertices by the number of connections from least to most:
Vertices sorted by their connections:
0 - 4 connections
2 - 2 connections
3 - 2 connections
6 - 2 connections
9 - 2 connections
1 - 3 connections
8 - 3 connections
7 - 5 connections
4 - 5 connections
5 - 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles formed:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 7, 4>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 3>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 0>
<4, 7, 0>
<4, 7, 3>
<5, 8, 0>
<5, 9, 7>
<7, 8, 0>
<7, 9, 5>

Total number of triangles: [19]
