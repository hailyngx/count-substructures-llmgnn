Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees (smallest to largest) is:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Now, we will iterate through the edges based on the sorted order of vertices and count the triangles formed by shared connections.

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<6, 8, 9>
