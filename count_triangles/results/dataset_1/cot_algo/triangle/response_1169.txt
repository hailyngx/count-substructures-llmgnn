Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new ordering is: 
Nodes: 2, 8, 1, 4, 7, 5, 6, 3, 0, 9

Following the degree-based ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(2, 7), (8, 7), (1, 9), (4, 7), (7, 9), (5, 6), (6, 7), (3, 0), (0, 9), (9, 5)

By counting the number of triangles formed by the shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles:
<2, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
