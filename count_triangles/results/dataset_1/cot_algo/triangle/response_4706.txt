Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the number of connections each node has:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 1 connection

Rearranging the nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order, we get: 9, 0, 6, 8, 5, 2, 7, 4, 3, 1

Now, we will iterate through each edge while following the degree-based ordering method to count the triangles:

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [10]
