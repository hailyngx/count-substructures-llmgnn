Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of vertices is as follows: 
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 0: 7 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles by examining the edges in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 1): Node 1 has 1 connection, so proceed.
2. Edge (0, 2): Node 2 has 4 connections, so proceed.
3. Edge (0, 3): Node 3 has 2 connections, so proceed.
4. Edge (0, 6): Node 6 has 4 connections, so proceed. Triangle found: <0, 2, 6>.
5. Edge (0, 7): Node 7 has 0 connections, so does not proceed.
6. Edge (0, 8): Node 8 has 4 connections, so proceed.
7. Edge (0, 9): Node 9 has 2 connections, so proceed. Triangle found: <0, 3, 9>.
8. Edge (1, 8): Node 8 has 4 connections, so proceed. Triangle found: <1, 0, 8>.
9. Edge (2, 3): Node 3 has 2 connections, so proceed.
10. Edge (2, 5): Node 5 has 4 connections, so proceed. Triangle found: <2, 0, 5>.
11. Edge (2, 6): Node 6 has 4 connections, so proceed.
12. Edge (4, 5): Node 5 has 4 connections, so proceed.
13. Edge (4, 6): Node 6 has 4 connections, so proceed. Triangle found: <4, 5, 6>.
14. Edge (5, 7): Node 7 has 0 connections, so does not proceed.
15. Edge (5, 9): Node 9 has 2 connections, so proceed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 0, 8>, <2, 0, 5>, <4, 5, 6>.
