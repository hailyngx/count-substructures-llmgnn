Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree: 

Node 4 has 1 connection.

Nodes 0 and 1 have 2 connections each.

Nodes 7 and 4 have 3 connections each.

Nodes 5 and 9 have 4 connections each.

Nodes 2 and 8 have 5 connections each.

Nodes 3 and 6 have 6 connections each.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles: 

Triangular relationships:
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
