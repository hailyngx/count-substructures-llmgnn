Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labels are: 
Node 7 has 0 connection(s).
Node 1 has 1 connection(s).
Node 0 has 2 connection(s).
Node 9 has 2 connection(s).
Node 5 has 2 connection(s).
Node 6 has 2 connection(s).
Node 4 has 3 connection(s).
Node 2 has 3 connection(s).
Node 3 has 4 connection(s).
Node 8 has 5 connection(s).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze each edge to count the triangles. 
We find that there are [6] triangles in the graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<6, 8, 9>
