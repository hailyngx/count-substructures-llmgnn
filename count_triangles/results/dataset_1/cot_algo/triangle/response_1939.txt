Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: 
1. 4 (degree 2)
2. 2 (degree 2) 
3. 1 (degree 2)
4. 9 (degree 3)
5. 8 (degree 3)
6. 6 (degree 4)
7. 0 (degree 5)
8. 7 (degree 5)
9. 5 (degree 6)
10. 3 (degree 6)

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. 

Starting with the vertex with the smallest degree, we have:
1. Vertices 1, 2, 3 are connected forming one triangle: <1, 2, 3>

Moving to the next vertices:
2. Checking vertex 4, no triangles can be formed with its connections.
3. Checking vertex 9, we have the following triangles:
   - <5, 7, 9>
   - <5, 6, 9>
   - <5, 0, 9>
   - <6, 7, 9>
   - <0, 7, 9>

Next:
4. Checking vertex 8, no triangles can be formed with its connections.
5. Checking vertex 6, we have the following triangles:
   - <5, 6, 7>
   - <5, 6, 0>
   - <0, 6, 7>
   - <6, 7, 9>
   - <7, 8, 6>

Next:
6. Checking vertex 0, we have the following triangles:
   - <0, 8, 2>
   - <0, 5, 3>
   - <0, 5, 7>
   - <0, 7, 9>
   - <0, 5, 9>

Last:
7. Checking vertex 7, we have the following triangles:
   - <7, 8, 6>
   - <7, 9, 1>
   - <7, 0, 5>
   - <7, 5, 9>
   - <7, 5, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [14]
