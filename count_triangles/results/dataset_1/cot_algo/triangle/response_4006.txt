Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
After ordering the vertices by degree, the new numbering is as follows:
- Vertex 0 has degree 3
- Vertex 1 has degree 2
- Vertex 5 has degree 2
- Vertex 4 has degree 3
- Vertex 6 has degree 3
- Vertex 3 has degree 4
- Vertex 8 has degree 4
- Vertex 2 has degree 5
- Vertex 7 has degree 5

Counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 4): Vertices 0 and 4 have 3 shared connections with vertices 5 and 8, forming a triangle <0, 4, 5>. 
- Edge (0, 5): Vertices 0 and 5 have no shared connections. 
- Edge (0, 8): Vertices 0 and 8 have 2 shared connections with vertices 4 and 5, forming two triangles <0, 4, 8> and <0, 5, 8>. 
- Edge (1, 2): Vertices 1 and 2 have no shared connections. 
- Edge (1, 3): Vertices 1 and 3 have no shared connections. 
- Edge (2, 1): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 2 has more connections. 
- Edge (2, 3): Vertices 2 and 3 have 1 shared connection with vertex 1, forming a triangle <1, 2, 3>. 
- Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 and 6 have no shared connections. 
- Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 and 7 have no shared connections. 
- Edge (3, 1): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 3 has more connections. 
- Edge (3, 2): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 3 has more connections. 
- Edge (3, 4): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 3 has more connections. 
- Edge (3, 8): Vertices 3 and 8 have 2 shared connections with vertices 0 and 5, forming two triangles <0, 3, 8> and <3, 5, 8>. 
- Edge (4, 0): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 4 has more connections. 
- Edge (4, 3): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 4 has more connections. 
- Edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 and 7 have 2 shared connections with vertices 5 and 6, forming two triangles <4, 5, 7> and <4, 6, 7>. 
- Edge (5, 0): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 5 has more connections. 
- Edge (5, 7): Vertices 5 and 7 have 1 shared connection with vertex 4, forming a triangle <4, 5, 7>. 
- Edge (5, 8): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 5 has more connections. 
- Edge (6, 2): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 6 has more connections. 
- Edge (6, 7): Vertices 6 and 7 have 1 shared connection with vertex 4, forming a triangle <4, 6, 7>. 
- Edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 and 8 have no shared connections. 
- Edge (7, 2): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 7 has more connections. 
- Edge (7, 4): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 7 has more connections. 
- Edge (7, 5): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 7 has more connections. 
- Edge (7, 6): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 7 has more connections. 
- Edge (8, 0): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 8 has more connections. 
- Edge (8, 3): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 8 has more connections. 
- Edge (8, 5): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 8 has more connections. 
- Edge (8, 6): Ignored due to ordering. Vertex 8 has more connections. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] inside brackets, and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, and <4, 6, 7>.
