Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices:
1. Node 0: 2 connections
2. Node 1: 1 connection
3. Node 5: 1 connection
4. Node 8: 2 connections
5. Node 9: 2 connections
6. Node 7: 3 connections
7. Node 3: 4 connections
8. Node 6: 4 connections
9. Node 2: 5 connections
10. Node 4: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 1 (1 connection) -> Node 0
Node 5 (1 connection) -> Node 1
Node 8 (2 connections) -> Node 2
Node 9 (2 connections) -> Node 3
Node 7 (3 connections) -> Node 4
Node 3 (4 connections) -> Node 5
Node 6 (4 connections) -> Node 6
Node 2 (5 connections) -> Node 7
Node 4 (5 connections) -> Node 8

Now, we will go through each edge and check for shared connections to count the number of triangles.

Triangles:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 4, 3>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <1, 2, 5>
5. <2, 6, 7>
6. <2, 6, 9>
7. <2, 3, 5>
8. <2, 3, 6>
9. <3, 6, 7>
10. <4, 6, 7>
11. <4, 6, 9>
12. <4, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [12]
