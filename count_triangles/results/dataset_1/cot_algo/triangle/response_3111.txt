Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are as follows:
- Node 0 has 3 connections.
- Node 5 has 0 connections (isolated).
- Node 9 has 1 connection.
- Node 7 has 3 connections.
- Node 1 has 3 connections. 
- Node 8 has 2 connections.
- Node 6 has 3 connections.
- Node 4 has 3 connections.
- Node 2 has 2 connections.
- Node 3 has 6 connections.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:

1. Edge (0, 2): Both vertices labeled correctly, but no triangle formed.
2. Edge (0, 3): Both vertices labeled correctly, but no triangle formed.
3. Edge (0, 7): Both vertices labeled correctly, but no triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 4): Both vertices labeled correctly, but no triangle formed.
5. Edge (1, 6): Both vertices labeled correctly, but no triangle formed.
6. Edge (1, 9): Both vertices labeled correctly, but no triangle formed.
7. Edge (3, 4): Both vertices labeled correctly, but no triangle formed.
8. Edge (3, 5): Both vertices labeled correctly, but no triangle formed.
9. Edge (3, 6): Both vertices labeled correctly, and a triangle <3, 4, 6> is formed.
10. Edge (3, 8): Both vertices labeled correctly, and a triangle <3, 6, 8> is formed.
11. Edge (4, 6): Both vertices labeled correctly, and a triangle <3, 4, 6> is formed.
12. Edge (5, 3): Both vertices labeled correctly, but no triangle formed.
13. Edge (6, 4): Both vertices labeled correctly, and a triangle <3, 4, 6> is formed.
14. Edge (7, 0): Both vertices labeled correctly, but no triangle formed.
15. Edge (7, 4): Both vertices labeled correctly, and a triangle <3, 4, 6> is formed.
16. Edge (7, 8): Both vertices labeled correctly, and a triangle <3, 6, 8> is formed.
17. Edge (8, 3): Both vertices labeled correctly, and a triangle <3, 6, 8> is formed.
18. Edge (9, 1): Both vertices labeled correctly, but no triangle formed.

Count of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>
