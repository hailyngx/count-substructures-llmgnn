Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 6
- Node 9 has degree 7

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 0 (degree 2) becomes Node 0
- Node 1 (degree 2) becomes Node 1
- Node 4 (degree 2) becomes Node 2
- Node 5 (degree 2) becomes Node 3
- Node 6 (degree 2) becomes Node 4
- Node 8 (degree 3) becomes Node 5
- Node 7 (degree 4) becomes Node 6
- Node 3 (degree 5) becomes Node 7
- Node 2 (degree 6) becomes Node 8
- Node 9 (degree 7) becomes Node 9

Now, let's check for triangles:

- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <1, 2, 9>
- Triangle <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <3, 7, 9>
- Triangle <4, 8, 5>
- Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
