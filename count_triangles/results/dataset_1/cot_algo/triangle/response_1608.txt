Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree = 2
- Node 1: degree = 3
- Node 2: degree = 3
- Node 3: degree = 5
- Node 4: degree = 2
- Node 5: degree = 6
- Node 6: degree = 5
- Node 7: degree = 3
- Node 8: degree = 2
- Node 9: degree = 3

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:

- Node 0 (degree 2) -> Node 0
- Node 4 (degree 2) -> Node 1
- Node 8 (degree 2) -> Node 2
- Node 1 (degree 3) -> Node 3
- Node 2 (degree 3) -> Node 4
- Node 7 (degree 3) -> Node 5
- Node 9 (degree 3) -> Node 6
- Node 3 (degree 5) -> Node 7
- Node 6 (degree 5) -> Node 8
- Node 5 (degree 6) -> Node 9

Now, we will list the edges according to the new labels:

(0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (1, 5) (6, 7) (7, 9)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by shared connections between the lower labeled nodes in each edge:

- Triangle 1: <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle 2: <3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
