Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Nodes: 3, 6, 7, 9, 0, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4

Using the degree-based ordering method, we consider the edges with the vertices in this order. 

Calculating the number of triangles:
For the edge (0, 4): Shared connections with 5
For the edge (0, 5): No triangles since 5 has a higher degree
For the edge (0, 8): Shared connections with 2, 4
For the edge (1, 2): Shared connection with 4
For the edge (1, 4): Shared connection with 0
For the edge (1, 5): No triangles since 5 has a higher degree
For the edge (1, 9): No triangles since 9 has a higher degree
For the edge (2, 1): Shared connection with 4
For the edge (2, 4): Shared connections with 0, 1, 8
For the edge (2, 8): Shared connections with 0, 4
For the edge (3, 6): No triangles since both have the same degree
For the edge (3, 7): No triangles since both have the same degree
For the edge (4, 0): Shared connections with 5
For the edge (4, 1): Shared connection with 2
For the edge (4, 2): Shared connections with 0, 1, 8
For the edge (4, 8): Shared connections with 0, 2
For the edge (5, 0): No triangles since 5 has a higher degree
For the edge (5, 1): No triangles since 5 has a higher degree
For the edge (5, 6): No triangles since 6 has a higher degree
For the edge (5, 9): No triangles since 5 has a higher degree
For the edge (6, 3): No triangles since both have the same degree
For the edge (6, 5): No triangles since 5 has a higher degree
For the edge (7, 3): No triangles since both have the same degree
For the edge (7, 8): No triangles since both have the same degree
For the edge (7, 9): No triangles since 9 has a higher degree
For the edge (8, 0): Shared connections with 4
For the edge (8, 2): Shared connections with 4
For the edge (8, 4): Shared connections with 0, 2
For the edge (8, 7): No triangles since both have the same degree
For the edge (9, 1): No triangles since 9 has a higher degree
For the edge (9, 5): No triangles since 5 has a higher degree
For the edge (9, 7): No triangles since 9 has a higher degree

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>
