Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 5, 4, 1, 2, 6, 9, 7, 8, 3, 10.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we look at the edges in the order provided:

1. Edge (1, 5): No triangles.
2. Edge (1, 9): No triangles.
3. Edge (2, 3): Triangle <2, 3, 4>.
4. Edge (2, 9): No triangles.
5. Edge (3, 2): Already counted.
6. Edge (3, 4): Already counted.
7. Edge (3, 6): Triangle <3, 6, 7>.
8. Edge (3, 7): Triangle <3, 6, 7>.
9. Edge (4, 3): Already counted.
10. Edge (4, 6): Triangle <4, 6, 7>.
11. Edge (5, 1): No triangles.
12. Edge (6, 3): Already counted.
13. Edge (6, 4): Already counted.
14. Edge (6, 7): Already counted.
15. Edge (7, 3): Already counted.
16. Edge (7, 6): Already counted.
17. Edge (7, 9): No triangles.
18. Edge (9, 1): No triangles.
19. Edge (9, 2): No triangles.
20. Edge (9, 7): No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <2, 3, 4>, <3, 6, 7>, and <4, 6, 7>.
