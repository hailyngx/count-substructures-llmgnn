Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 3: Degree 1
Node 0: Degree 2
Nodes 7: Degree 2
Nodes 1 and 7: Degree 4
Nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6: Degree 6
Node 9: Degree 7

Now, let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Starting with the edge (0, 2): Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 2, so we proceed.
   Node 0 shares a connection with Node 2, forming a triangle with Node 2.
2. Moving to the edge (1, 2): Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 2, so we proceed.
   Nodes 1 and 2 share a connection with Node 0, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
3. Continuing with the edge (1, 4): Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 4, so we proceed.
   Nodes 1 and 4 share a connection with Node 5, forming a triangle <1, 4, 5>.
4. Next, the edge (1, 5): Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 5, so we proceed.
   Nodes 1 and 5 share a connection with Node 4, forming a triangle <1, 4, 5>.
5. Moving on to the edge (1, 9): Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 9, so we proceed.
   Nodes 1 and 9 share connections with Nodes 4 and 5, forming two triangles: <1, 4, 9> and <1, 5, 9>.
6. The edge (2, 6) is next: Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 6, so we proceed.
   Node 2 shares a connection with Nodes 0 and 1, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
7. Lastly, the edge (3, 8): Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 8, so we proceed.
   However, there are no triangles formed with this edge.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7] (inside brackets). The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <1, 4, 5>, and <1, 4, 9>.
