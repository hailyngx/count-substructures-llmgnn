Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, we obtain the following labels: 

Node 7 - Degree: 2
Node 1 - Degree: 2
Node 4 - Degree: 2
Node 6 - Degree: 2
Node 0 - Degree: 3
Node 5 - Degree: 3
Node 3 - Degree: 4
Node 1 - Degree: 4
Node 1 - Degree: 5
Node 1 - Degree: 6

Proceeding with the degree-based ordering, we consider the edges while ensuring that the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 3): Shared connections with node 1, forms triangle <0, 3, 1>.
2. Edge (0, 4): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (0, 8): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (1, 2): Shared connection with node 5, forms triangle <1, 2, 5>.
5. Edge (1, 3): Shared connection with node 0, forms triangle <1, 3, 0>.
6. Edge (2, 1): Shared connection with node 5, forms triangle <2, 1, 5>.
7. Edge (2, 5): Shared connection with nodes 1 and 3, forms triangles <2, 5, 1> and <2, 5, 3>.
8. Edge (2, 8): Shared connections with nodes 0, 5, and 9, forms triangles <2, 8, 0> and <2, 8, 5>.
9. Edge (2, 9): Shared connections with nodes 4, 6, and 7, forms triangle <2, 9, 4>.
10. Edge (3, 0): Shared connection with node 1, forms triangle <3, 0, 1>.
11. Edge (3, 1): Shared connection with node 0, forms triangle <3, 1, 0>.
12. Edge (3, 5): Shared connection with node 2, forms triangle <3, 5, 2>.
13. Edge (4, 0): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
15. Edge (5, 2): Shared connections with nodes 1 and 3, forms triangles <5, 2, 1> and <5, 2, 3>.
16. Edge (5, 3): Shared connection with node 2, forms triangle <5, 3, 2>.
17. Edge (5, 8): Shared connections with nodes 0 and 2, forms triangle <5, 8, 0>.
18. Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
19. Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.
20. Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
21. Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.
22. Edge (8, 0): No triangles formed.
23. Edge (8, 2): Shared connections with nodes 1 and 3, forms triangles <8, 2, 1> and <8, 2, 3>.
24. Edge (8, 5): Shared connection with node 2, forms triangle <8, 5, 2>.
25. Edge (8, 9): Shared connection with nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7, forms triangle <8, 9, 2>.
26. Edge (9, 2): Shared connections with nodes 1, 4, 6, and 7, forms triangle <9, 2, 1>.
27. Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.
28. Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed.
29. Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed.
30. Edge (9, 8): Shared connections with nodes 0, 2, and 5, forms triangle <9, 8, 0>.
