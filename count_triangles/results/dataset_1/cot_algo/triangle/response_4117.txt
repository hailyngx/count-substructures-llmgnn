Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves relabeling the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices:
- Vertex 0 has 3 connections.
- Vertex 1 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 2 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 3 has 5 connections.
- Vertex 4 has 1 connection.
- Vertex 5 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 6 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 7 has 3 connections.
- Vertex 8 has 3 connections.
- Vertex 9 has 2 connections.

Based on the relabeling, we should consider the edges in the following order:
(4, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 6) (7, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 9) (8, 9)

Now, we will count the number of triangles by examining the shared connections:

- Triangle <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle <5, 6, 2>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
