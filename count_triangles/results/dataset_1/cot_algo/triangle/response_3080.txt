Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labeling of vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 3, 0, 4, 6, 4, 7, 8, 2, 5, 1

The triangles in the graph are:
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
