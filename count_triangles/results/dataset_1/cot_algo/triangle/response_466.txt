Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we obtain the following order: 5, 1, 8, 2, 9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 0. 

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph.

We will start by checking each edge to find triangles formed by shared connections:

(0, 3): Forms triangles with edges (0, 6) and (3, 6)
(0, 6): No new triangles
(0, 9): No new triangles
(1, 4): No new triangles
(1, 6): No new triangles
(2, 3): No new triangles
(2, 9): No new triangles
(3, 2): Forms a triangle with edge (2, 9)
(3, 4): No new triangles
(3, 6): No new triangles
(4, 1): No new triangles
(4, 3): No new triangles
(4, 8): Forms a triangle with edge (8, 6)
(5, 9): No new triangles
(6, 1): No new triangles
(6, 3): No new triangles
(6, 8): No new triangles
(8, 4): No new triangles
(8, 6): No new triangles
(9, 0): No new triangles
(9, 2): No new triangles
(9, 5): No new triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 6> and <4, 6, 8>.
