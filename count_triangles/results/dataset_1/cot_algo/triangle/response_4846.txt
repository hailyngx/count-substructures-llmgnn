Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 6: 1 connection 
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 4: 6 connections
- Node 5: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 1), (1, 5), (5, 2), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 8), (6, 9), (7, 8)

By examining shared connections between vertices connected by these edges, we find the triangles:
- <1, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
