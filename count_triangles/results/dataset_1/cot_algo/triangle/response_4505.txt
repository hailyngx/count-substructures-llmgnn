Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 3: degree 0
- Node 6: degree 0
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 2 (degree 6).
   - Shared neighbors: 7, 8
   - Triangle formed: <0, 7, 8>

2. Edge (0, 7): Node 0 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 7 (degree 4).
   - Shared neighbors: 2, 9
   - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 9>

3. Edge (0, 8): Node 0 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 8 (degree 3).
   - Shared neighbors: 9
   - Triangle formed: <0, 9, 8>

4. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 2 (degree 6).
   - Shared neighbors: None

5. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 9 (degree 5).
   - Shared neighbors: 5
   - Triangle formed: <1, 5, 9>

6. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 (degree 6) has fewer connections than Node 7 (degree 4).
   - Shared neighbors: None

7. Edge (7, 9): Node 7 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 9 (degree 5).
   - Shared neighbors: None

8. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 9 (degree 5).
   - Shared neighbors: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 7, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 9, 8>, and <1, 5, 9>.
