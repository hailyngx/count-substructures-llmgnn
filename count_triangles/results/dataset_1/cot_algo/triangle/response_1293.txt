Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Considering the edges based on degree-based ordering:
(0, 2) [Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 2]
(0, 9) [Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 9]
(1, 4) [Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 4]
(1, 6) [Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 6]
(1, 7) [Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 7]
(1, 8) [Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 8]
(1, 9) [Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 9]
(2, 3) [Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 3]
(2, 6) [Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 6]
(2, 8) [Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 8]
(2, 9) [Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 9]
(3, 4) [Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 4]
(3, 5) [Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 5]
(3, 7) [Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 7]
(3, 8) [Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 8]
(3, 9) [Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 9]
(4, 7) [Node 4 has fewer connections than Node 7]
(6, 7) [Node 6 and Node 7 have shared connections with Node 1, forming triangle <1, 6, 7>]
(6, 9) [Node 6 has fewer connections than Node 9]
(7, 8) [Node 7 and Node 8 have shared connections with Node 1, forming triangle <1, 7, 8>]
(8, 9) [Node 8 has fewer connections than Node 9]

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>
