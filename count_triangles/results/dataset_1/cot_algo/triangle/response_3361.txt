Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following labels for the vertices:  
Node 3, 4 have 2 connections  
Node 0, 7, 9 have 3 connections  
Node 2, 8 have 4 connections  
Node 1, 5, 6 have 5 connections  

Let's find the triangles formed by using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:  
[15]  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 2, 6>  
<0, 2, 8>  
<0, 5, 6>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<1, 2, 5>  
<1, 2, 6>  
<1, 5, 6>  
<5, 6, 8>
