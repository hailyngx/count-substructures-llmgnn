Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections, the new labels are as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 4: 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (1, 2): forms triangle with node 4 <1, 2, 4>
- (1, 3): forms triangle with node 0 <0, 1, 3>
- (1, 4): forms triangle with node 0 <0, 1, 4>
- (1, 6): no triangles
- (2, 1): forms triangle with node 4 <1, 2, 4>
- (0, 3): forms triangle with node 4 <0, 3, 4>
- (0, 4): no triangles
- (0, 7): no triangles
- (0, 9): forms triangle with node 4 <0, 4, 9>
- (5, 6): no triangles
- (5, 8): no triangles
- (7, 0): no triangles
- (8, 5): no triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
