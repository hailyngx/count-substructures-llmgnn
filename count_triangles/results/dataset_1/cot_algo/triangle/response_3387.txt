Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes: 1 7 0 4 8 5 6 3 9 2

By degree: 1(2) 7(1) 0(2) 4(3) 8(4) 5(4) 6(4) 3(5) 9(5) 2(7)

Now, we count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 9, 7>
<3, 9, 8>
