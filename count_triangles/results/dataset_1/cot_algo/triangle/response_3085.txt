Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new vertex labels are as follows:
Node 0 -> Degree 2
Node 1 -> Degree 2
Node 4 -> Degree 2
Node 6 -> Degree 2
Node 7 -> Degree 2
Node 5 -> Degree 3
Node 9 -> Degree 3
Node 8 -> Degree 4
Node 3 -> Degree 5
Node 2 -> Degree 5

Now, examining each edge in the order specified:

- Edge (0, 3): Node 0 and Node 3 share a connection with Node 5, forming a triangle <0, 3, 5>.

- Edge (0, 5): Node 0 and Node 5 share a connection with Node 2, forming a triangle <0, 5, 2>.

- Edge (1, 3): Node 1 and Node 3 do not form a triangle.

- Edge (1, 7): Node 1 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.

- Edge (2, 4): Node 2 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.

- Edge (2, 5): Node 2 and Node 5 share a connection with Node 0, forming a triangle <2, 5, 0>.

- Edge (2, 8): Node 2 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.

- Edge (3, 0): Already counted as a triangle from edge (0, 3).

- Edge (3, 1): Already checked, no additional triangle.

- Edge (3, 8): Node 3 and Node 8 share a connection with Node 5, forming a triangle <3, 8, 5>.

- Edge (4, 2): Already checked, no additional triangle.

- Edge (5, 0): Already counted as a triangle from edge (0, 5).

- Edge (5, 2): Already counted as a triangle from edge (2, 5).

- Edge (5, 6): Node 5 and Node 6 do not form a triangle.

- Edge (6, 5): No additional triangle.

- Edge (7, 1): Already checked, no additional triangle.

- Edge (7, 9): Node 7 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.

- Edge (8, 2): Already checked, no additional triangle.

- Edge (8, 3): Already counted as a triangle from edge (3, 8).

- Edge (8, 9): Node 8 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.

- Edge (9, 7): Already checked, no additional triangle.

- Edge (9, 8): Already checked, no additional triangle.

In total, there are [3] triangles in the given graph:
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 2>, <3, 8, 5>.
