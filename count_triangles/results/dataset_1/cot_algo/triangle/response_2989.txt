Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the degree of each vertex:

- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 1

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 0 -> Node 0 (degree 1)
- Node 3 -> Node 2 (degree 2)
- Node 4 -> Node 3 (degree 2)
- Node 5 -> Node 1 (degree 1)
- Node 6 -> Node 4 (degree 1)
- Node 7 -> Node 5 (degree 2)
- Node 8 -> Node 6 (degree 3)
- Node 9 -> Node 7 (degree 1)

Now, we check each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 3) (Node 0, Node 2) forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 2, 3>
2. Edge (3, 4) (Node 2, Node 3) forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 2, 3>
3. Edge (4, 8) (Node 3, Node 6) does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (5, 8) (Node 1, Node 6) does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (6, 7) (Node 4, Node 5) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (7, 9) (Node 5, Node 7) does not form a triangle.
