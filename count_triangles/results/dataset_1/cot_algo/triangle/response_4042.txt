Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices will be: 
Node 5 (Degree 0), Node 5 (Degree 0), Node 5 (Degree 1), Node 5 (Degree 1), Node 0 (Degree 2), Node 2 (Degree 2), Node 4 (Degree 2), Node 6 (Degree 2), Node 3 (Degree 3), Node 1 (Degree 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles by checking shared connections between vertices of each edge, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
