Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows: 

0 (degree 4)
3 (degree 3)
8 (degree 3)
9 (degree 2)
4 (degree 2)
6 (degree 2)
1 (degree 1)
2 (degree 1)
5 (degree 0)
7 (degree 0)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider edges involving vertices with lower labels and fewer connections.

The triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<8, 3, 4>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
