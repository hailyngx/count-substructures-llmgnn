Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degrees:

0: 3 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 1 connection
4: 6 connections
5: 5 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 4 connections

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (0, 4): 0 and 4 have 3 and 6 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: 5
- Edge (0, 5): 0 and 5 have 3 and 5 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: 4
- Edge (0, 6): 0 and 6 have 3 and 3 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 4): 1 and 4 have 2 and 6 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 8): 1 and 8 have 2 and 2 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 6): 2 and 6 have 3 and 3 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 8): 2 and 8 have 3 and 2 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 9): 2 and 9 have 3 and 4 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: None
- Edge (3, 4): 3 and 4 have 1 and 6 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: None
- Edge (4, 5): 4 and 5 have 6 and 5 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: 0
- Edge (4, 7): 4 and 7 have 6 and 2 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: None
- Edge (4, 9): 4 and 9 have 6 and 4 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: None
- Edge (5, 6): 5 and 6 have 5 and 3 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: 0
- Edge (5, 7): 5 and 7 have 5 and 2 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: None
- Edge (5, 9): 5 and 9 have 5 and 4 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: None
- Edge (6, 9): 6 and 9 have 3 and 4 connections respectively, so proceed.
  Shared connections: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [2]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 5> and <0, 5, 6>.
