Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, we get the following new labels for the nodes:  
Node 0 with degree 3  
Node 1 with degree 3  
Node 3 with degree 2  
Node 9 with degree 2  
Node 7 with degree 2  
Node 5 with degree 3  
Node 6 with degree 4  
Node 4 with degree 4  
Node 8 with degree 5  
Node 2 with degree 4  

Now, we will count the triangles:  
For each edge, we will only consider the cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  

Triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
