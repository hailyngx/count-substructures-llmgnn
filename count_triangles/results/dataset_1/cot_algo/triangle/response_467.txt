Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new numbering of the vertices is:
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 5, so triangle <0, 2, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 5): Shared connections with 2, 7, and 8, forming triangles <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 7>, and <0, 5, 8>.
3. Edge (0, 7): Shared connections with 5 and 1, forming triangles <0, 7, 5> and <0, 7, 1>.
4. Edge (0, 8): Shared connection with 5, forming triangle <0, 8, 5>.
5. Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (2, 5): Shared connection with 0, forming triangle <2, 5, 0>.
8. Edge (3, 1): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (4, 3): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
15. Edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
18. Edge (8, 5): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
