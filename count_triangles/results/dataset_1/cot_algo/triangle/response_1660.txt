Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the graph is as follows:

Node Degree:
0: 2
1: 3
2: 3
3: 2
4: 2
5: 5
6: 3
7: 3
8: 1
9: 1

Sorted by Degree:
8, 9, 0, 4, 3, 6, 7, 2, 1, 5

Triangles:
[6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. Unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>.
