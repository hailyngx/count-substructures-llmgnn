Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we can relabel the nodes from 0 to 9 as follows:  

Node 4: degree 0  
Node 7: degree 0  
Node 6: degree 1  
Node 0: degree 2  
Node 5: degree 2  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 5  
Node 2: degree 6  
Node 9: degree 6  

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (0, 2): Both nodes 0 and 2 have degrees less than 6. Since they share node 1 as a neighbor, triangle <0, 1, 2> is found.
2. Edge (0, 8): Both nodes 0 and 8 have degrees less than 6. They share node 1 as a neighbor, forming triangle <0, 1, 8>.
3. Edge (1, 2): Both nodes 1 and 2 have degrees less than 6. They share node 0 as a neighbor, forming triangle <0, 1, 2>.
4. Edge (1, 3): Both nodes 1 and 3 have degrees less than 6. They share node 9 as a neighbor, forming triangle <1, 3, 9>.
5. Edge (1, 8): Both nodes 1 and 8 have degrees less than 6. They share node 0 as a neighbor, forming triangle <0, 1, 8>.
6. Edge (1, 9): Both nodes 1 and 9 have degrees less than 6. Since they share node 3 as a neighbor, triangle <1, 3, 9> is found.
7. Edge (2, 0): Skipped because node 2's degree is higher than node 0's degree.
8. Edge (2, 1): Skipped because node 2's degree is higher than node 1's degree.
9. Edge (3, 1): Skipped because node 3's degree is higher than node 1's degree.
10. Edge (3, 5): No triangles are formed.
11. Edge (3, 9): Both nodes 3 and 9 have degrees equal to 6. They share node 1 as a neighbor, forming triangle <1, 3, 9>.
12. Edge (5, 3): No triangles are formed.
13. Edge (6, 9): No triangles are formed.
14. Edge (7, 8): No triangles are formed.
15. Edge (8, 0): Skipped because node 8's degree is higher than node 0's degree.
16. Edge (8, 1): Skipped because node 8's degree is higher than node 1's degree.
17. Edge (8, 7): No triangles are formed.
18. Edge (8, 9): Both nodes 8 and 9 have degrees equal to 6. They share node 1 as a neighbor, forming triangle <1, 8, 9>.
19. Edge (9, 1): Skipped because node 9's degree is higher than node 1's degree.
20. Edge (9, 3): Both nodes 9 and 3 have degrees equal to 6. They share node 1 as a neighbor, forming triangle <1, 3, 9>.
21. Edge (9, 6): No triangles are formed.
22. Edge (9, 8): Skipped because node 9's degree is higher than node 8's degree.

Count of triangles: [4]
Triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 8, 9>
