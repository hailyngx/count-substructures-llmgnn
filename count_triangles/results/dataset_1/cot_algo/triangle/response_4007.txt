Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Node 1: 0 connections
   - Node 6: 1 connection
   - Node 7: 2 connections
   - Node 0: 3 connections
   - Node 3: 3 connections
   - Node 5: 3 connections
   - Node 9: 3 connections
   - Node 8: 4 connections
   - Node 4: 6 connections
   - Node 2: 6 connections

2. Relabel vertices accordingly: 
   - Node 1 (0 connections) -> Node A
   - Node 6 (1 connection) -> Node B
   - Node 7 (2 connections) -> Node C
   - Node 0 (3 connections) -> Node D
   - Node 3 (3 connections) -> Node E
   - Node 5 (3 connections) -> Node F
   - Node 9 (3 connections) -> Node G
   - Node 8 (4 connections) -> Node H
   - Node 4 (6 connections) -> Node I
   - Node 2 (6 connections) -> Node J

3. Analyze edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - Edge: (A, D) -> No triangle formed
   - Edge: (B, D) -> No triangle formed
   - Edge: (C, E) -> No triangle formed
   - Edge: (D, J) -> No triangle formed
   - Edge: (E, J) -> No triangle formed
   - Edge: (F, J) -> Triangle <5, 4, 2> found
   - Edge: (G, J) -> No triangle formed
   - Edge: (H, J) -> Triangle <8, 4, 2> found

4. Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [2]
   Unique triangles found inside <>: <5, 4, 2>, <8, 4, 2>
