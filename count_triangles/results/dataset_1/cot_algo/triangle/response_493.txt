Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

0: degree 3
2: degree 1
5: degree 2
7: degree 2
9: degree 2
6: degree 2
8: degree 3
3: degree 4
1: degree 6
4: degree 5

Now we go through the edges in ascending order of the vertex labels and check for triangles:

<0, 1, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [5]
