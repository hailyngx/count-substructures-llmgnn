Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is: 

Vertices: 4, 9, 2, 7, 3, 6, 1, 5, 8, 0

Now we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (4, 8):
   - Vertex 4 has 1 connection and Vertex 8 has 4 connections.
   - Check for shared connections: None

2. Edge (9, 4):
   - Vertex 9 has 1 connection and Vertex 4 has 2 connections.
   - Check for shared connections: None

3. Edge (2, 3):
   - Vertex 2 has 2 connections and Vertex 3 has 3 connections.
   - Check for shared connections: None

4. Edge (7, 2):
   - Vertex 7 has 2 connections and Vertex 2 has 3 connections.
   - Check for shared connections: None

5. Edge (3, 6):
   - Vertex 3 has 3 connections and Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
   - Check for shared connections: None

6. Edge (1, 5):
   - Vertex 1 has 3 connections and Vertex 5 has 4 connections.
   - Check for shared connections: None

7. Edge (5, 6):
   - Vertex 5 has 4 connections and Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
   - Check for shared connections: None

The total number of triangles is [0].
