Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly:  

Node 5: degree 2  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 5  
Node 8: degree 5  
Node 6: degree 6  
Node 2: degree 6  
Node 3: degree 7  
Node 0: degree 8  

Now, we will analyze the edges in the graph based on the relabeled vertices:  

- Edge (2, 3): forms a triangle with shared connection 4  
- Edge (2, 4): forms a triangle with shared connection 3  
- Edge (5, 6): no triangle formed (node 5 has the lower label but both have degree 2)  
- Edge (0, 3): forms a triangle with shared connection 9  
- Edge (0, 6): forms a triangle with shared connection 8  
- Edge (0, 8): forms a triangle with shared connection 5  
- Edge (0, 9): no triangle formed (node 0 has the lower label but both have degree 3)  
- Edge (2, 6): forms a triangle with shared connection 0  
- Edge (2, 9): forms a triangle with shared connection 2  
- Edge (3, 4): forms a triangle with shared connection 2  
- Edge (3, 7): forms a triangle with shared connection 6  
- Edge (4, 3): no triangle formed (node 4 has the lower label but both have degree 4)  
- Edge (5, 8): forms a triangle with shared connection 6  
- Edge (6, 0): no triangle formed (node 6 has the lower label but both have degree 6)  
- Edge (6, 2): forms a triangle with shared connection 0  
- Edge (6, 5): forms a triangle with shared connection 8  
- Edge (6, 7): forms a triangle with shared connection 3  
- Edge (6, 8): forms a triangle with shared connection 5  
- Edge (7, 3): no triangle formed (node 7 has the lower label but both have degree 3)  
- Edge (7, 6): forms a triangle with shared connection 8  
- Edge (7, 8): forms a triangle with shared connection 6  
- Edge (8, 0): no triangle formed (node 8 has the lower label but both have degree 5)  
- Edge (8, 5): forms a triangle with shared connection 6  
- Edge (8, 6): forms a triangle with shared connection 0  
- Edge (8, 7): forms a triangle with shared connection 6  
- Edge (9, 0): no triangle formed (node 9 has the lower label but both have degree 3)  
- Edge (9, 2): forms a triangle with shared connection 0  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12], and the unique triangles found are:  
<0, 3, 8>  
<0, 6, 8>  
<2, 3, 4>  
<2, 6, 0>  
<2, 6, 9>  
<3, 4, 2>  
<3, 7, 6>  
<5, 6, 8>  
<6, 7, 8>  
<6, 8, 0>  
<7, 6, 8>  
<8, 7, 6>
