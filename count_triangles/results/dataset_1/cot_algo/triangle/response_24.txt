Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0 (degree 2)
- Node 7 (degree 2)
- Node 6 (degree 3)
- Node 9 (degree 3)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 8 (degree 5)
- Node 1 (degree 6)
- Node 4 (degree 6)
- Node 3 (degree 7)

Now, applying the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges, we find the following triangles: 
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 6, 9>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
