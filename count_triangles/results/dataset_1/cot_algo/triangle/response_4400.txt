Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the degree of each node:
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 0
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 1
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 1
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
Node 1 (degree 0)
Node 3 (degree 1)
Node 2 (degree 2)
Node 6 (degree 2)
Node 7 (degree 1)
Node 8 (degree 3)
Node 0 (degree 3)
Node 5 (degree 3)
Node 4 (degree 4)
Node 9 (degree 4)

Next, we will examine each edge following the degree-based ordering:
1. Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed.
2. Edge (3, 2): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (8, 0): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>
7. Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (5, 4): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>
9. Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5> and <0, 4, 6>.
