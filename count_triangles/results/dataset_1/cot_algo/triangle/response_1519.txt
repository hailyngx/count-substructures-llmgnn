Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will label the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:  
Vertex 0 has degree 3  
Vertex 1 has degree 3  
Vertex 4 has degree 2  
Vertex 6 has degree 1  
Vertices 2, 3, 5, 8 have degree 0  
Vertices 7, 9 have degree 5

Now, we will consider the edges in the order specified. Since we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will skip the edges (1, 4), (3, 9), (4, 8), (5, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), and (9, 5).

Analyzing the remaining edges:  
1. Edge (0, 2): Forms a triangle <0, 2, 6>  
2. Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle <0, 3, 9>  
3. Edge (0, 6): No additional triangles  
4. Edge (1, 7): Forms a triangle <1, 7, 5>  
5. Edge (2, 0): No additional triangles  
6. Edge (3, 0): No additional triangles  
7. Edge (4, 1): No additional triangles  
8. Edge (5, 9): No additional triangles  
9. Edge (6, 0): No additional triangles  
10. Edge (7, 1): No additional triangles  
11. Edge (7, 5): Forms a triangle <7, 5, 9>  
12. Edge (7, 9): Forms a triangle <7, 9, 3>  
13. Edge (8, 4): No additional triangles  
14. Edge (8, 7): No additional triangles  
15. Edge (9, 3): No additional triangles  
16. Edge (9, 7): No additional triangles  
17. Edge (9, 8): No additional triangles  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 4, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 7, 5>, and <7, 5, 9>.  
The final output is [4].
