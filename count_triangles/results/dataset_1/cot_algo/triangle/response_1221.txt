Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 1 (Degree 1): 1
Node 8 (Degree 1): 6
Node 0 (Degree 3): 2
Node 3 (Degree 1): 3
Node 5 (Degree 2): 4
Node 7 (Degree 3): 5
Node 4 (Degree 4): 7
Node 2 (Degree 2): 8
Node 6 (Degree 5): 9
Node 9 (Degree 7): 10

Checking the edges starting from the edge with the lower labeled vertex, we find the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
