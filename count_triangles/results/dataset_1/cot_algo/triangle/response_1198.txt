Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be as follows:
- Node 0 has 1 connection.
- Node 7 has 1 connection.
- Node 8 has 1 connection.
- Node 3 has 2 connections.
- Node 4 has 2 connections.
- Node 5 has 3 connections.
- Node 1 has 4 connections.
- Node 9 has 5 connections.
- Node 2 has 6 connections.
- Node 6 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- (0, 9) is skipped since both nodes have the same degree.
- (1, 2) forms triangle <1, 2, 6>.
- (1, 3) is skipped since node 3 has a lower degree than node 1.
- (1, 4) is skipped since node 4 has a lower degree than node 1.
- (1, 5) is skipped since node 5 has a lower degree than node 1.
- (1, 6) is skipped since both nodes have the same degree.
- (2, 1) forms triangle <1, 2, 6>.
- (2, 5) is skipped since node 5 has a lower degree than node 2.
- (2, 6) forms triangle <1, 2, 6>.
- (2, 7) is skipped since node 7 has a lower degree than node 2.
- (2, 8) is skipped since node 8 has a lower degree than node 2.
- (3, 1) is skipped since both nodes have the same degree.
- (3, 6) forms triangle <1, 3, 6>.
- (4, 1) is skipped since both nodes have the same degree.
- (4, 9) is skipped since node 9 has a lower degree than node 4.
- (5, 1) is skipped since both nodes have the same degree.
- (5, 2) is skipped since node 2 has a lower degree than node 5.
- (5, 9) is skipped since node 9 has a lower degree than node 5.
- (6, 1) forms triangle <1, 3, 6>.
- (6, 2) forms triangle <1, 2, 6>.
- (6, 3) is skipped since node 3 has a lower degree than node 6.
- (6, 7) is skipped since node 7 has a lower degree than node 6.
- (6, 9) is skipped since node 9 has a lower degree than node 6.
- (7, 2) is skipped since node 2 has a lower degree than node 7.
- (7, 6) is skipped since node 6 has a lower degree than node 7.
- (8, 2) is skipped since node 2 has a lower degree than node 8.
- (9, 0) is skipped since node 0 has a lower degree than node 9.
- (9, 4) is skipped since node 4 has a lower degree than node 9.
- (9, 5) is skipped since node 5 has a lower degree than node 9.
- (9, 6) is skipped since node 6 has a lower degree than node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and they are <1, 2, 6> and <1, 3, 6>.
