Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Thus, we will look at the edges involving nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Analyzing the edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 8, 2>
<4, 8, 6>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 9, 2>
<4, 9, 6>
<4, 9, 7>
<6, 8, 7>
<8, 2, 9>
<8, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: [14]
