Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following labels:
Vertex 0 has degree 2
Vertex 1 has degree 1
Vertex 2 has degree 1
Vertex 3 has degree 6
Vertex 4 has degree 5
Vertex 5 has degree 3
Vertex 6 has degree 0
Vertex 7 has degree 4
Vertex 8 has degree 1
Vertex 9 has degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze each edge:

Edge (0, 3): Both vertices have labels [0, 3]. They share the common neighbor 9. So, triangle <0, 3, 9> is found.

Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has a lower label but only has one connection. No triangle is formed.

Edge (1, 4): Both vertices have labels [1, 4]. They share the common neighbor 2. So, triangle <1, 4, 2> is found.

Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 has a lower label and only one connection. No triangle is formed.

Edge (3, 0): Vertex 0 has a lower label but only has two connections. No triangle is formed.

Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 has a lower label and enough connections to proceed. They share the common neighbor 9. So, triangle <3, 4, 9> is found.

Edge (3, 7): Vertex 3 has a lower label and enough connections to proceed. They share the common neighbor 5. So, triangle <3, 7, 5> is found.

Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 has a lower label and enough connections to proceed. They share the common neighbor 0. So, triangle <3, 9, 0> is found.

Edge (4, 1): Vertex 1 has a lower label and only one connection. No triangle is formed.

Edge (4, 2): Vertex 2 has a lower label and only one connection. No triangle is formed.

Edge (4, 3): Both vertices have labels [3, 4]. They share the common neighbor 9. So, triangle <4, 3, 9> is found.

Edge (4, 9): Vertex 4 has a lower label and enough connections to proceed. They share the common neighbor 3. So, triangle <4, 9, 3> is found.

Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has a lower label and only one connection. No triangle is formed.

Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 has a lower label and enough connections to proceed. They share the common neighbor 3. So, triangle <5, 9, 3> is found.

Edge (7, 3): Vertex 3 has a lower label and enough connections to proceed. They share the common neighbor 5. So, triangle <7, 3, 5> is found.

Edge (7, 5): Vertex 5 has a lower label and enough connections to proceed. They share the common neighbor 3. So, triangle <7, 5, 3> is found.

Edge (7, 8): Vertex 7 has a lower label and only one connection. No triangle is formed.

Edge (8, 7): Vertex 7 has a lower label and only one connection. No triangle is formed.

Edge (9, 0): Vertex 0 has a lower label but only has two connections. No triangle is formed.

Edge (9, 3): Both vertices have labels [3, 9]. They share the common neighbor 0. So, triangle <9, 3, 0> is found.

Edge (9, 4): Vertex 4 has a lower label and enough connections to proceed. They share the common neighbor 3. So, triangle <9, 4, 3> is found.

Edge (9, 5): Vertex 5 has a lower label and enough connections to proceed. They share the common neighbor 3. So, triangle <9, 5, 3> is found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
