Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Node 2 with 0 connections 
Node 3 with 0 connections 
Node 7 with 1 connection 
Node 8 with 1 connection 
Node 0 with 2 connections 
Node 4 with 3 connections 
Node 6 with 3 connections 
Node 1 with 5 connections 
Node 5 with 5 connections 
Node 9 with 5 connections 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph. 

There are 3 triangles in the graph. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 5, 9> 
<1, 4, 9> 
<1, 5, 6> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
