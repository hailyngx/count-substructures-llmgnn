Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels are:
(1) 3 connections: 5
(2) 4 connections: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
(1) 1 connection: 3, 8

Checking each edge, we find the following triangles:
<4, 0, 5>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 2, 0>
<5, 2, 3>
<5, 2, 9>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 4, 7>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 1, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
