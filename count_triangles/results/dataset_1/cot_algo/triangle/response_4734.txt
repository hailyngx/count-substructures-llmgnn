Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following order: 

Node 2 (Degree 2)  
Node 6 (Degree 2)  
Node 5 (Degree 2)  
Node 1 (Degree 2)  
Node 0 (Degree 3)  
Node 3 (Degree 3)  
Node 9 (Degree 3)  
Node 8 (Degree 3)  
Node 7 (Degree 5)  
Node 4 (Degree 5)  

Starting with the vertices with the lowest degrees and moving to the highest degrees, we count the number of triangles formed:

Triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <0, 4, 7>
5. <1, 4, 7>
6. <2, 7, 5>
7. <6, 4, 9>
8. <7, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
