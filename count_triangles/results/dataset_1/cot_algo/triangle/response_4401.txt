Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:

Vertex 1 -> 1 (Degree 0)
Vertex 0 -> 2 (Degree 3)
Vertex 2 -> 3 (Degree 3)
Vertex 5 -> 4 (Degree 2)
Vertex 8 -> 5 (Degree 2)
Vertex 9 -> 6 (Degree 3)
Vertex 4 -> 7 (Degree 4)
Vertex 6 -> 8 (Degree 2)
Vertex 7 -> 9 (Degree 3)
Vertex 3 -> 10 (Degree 3)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles formed by shared connections between the vertices are:

<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
