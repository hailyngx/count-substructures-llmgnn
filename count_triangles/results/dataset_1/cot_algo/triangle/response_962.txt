Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. (0, 1): Shared connections with node 0: [5, 6]. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>.
2. (0, 5): No triangle formed.
3. (0, 6): Shared connections with node 0: [1, 9]. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>.
4. (1, 3): No triangle formed.
5. (1, 8): No triangle formed.
6. (1, 9): Shared connections with node 1: [0]. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>.
7. (2, 9): No triangle formed.
8. (4, 7): No triangle formed.
9. (6, 9): Shared connections with node 6: [0]. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>.
10. (7, 4): No triangle formed.
11. (7, 9): Shared connections with node 7: [4]. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 9>.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, and <4, 7, 9>.
