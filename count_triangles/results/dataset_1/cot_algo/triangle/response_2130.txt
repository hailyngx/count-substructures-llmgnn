Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes by their degree we get:  
Node 7 -> degree 2  
Node 5 -> degree 3  
Node 8 -> degree 4  
Node 3 -> degree 4  
Node 6 -> degree 4  
Node 2 -> degree 4  
Node 0 -> degree 5  
Node 9 -> degree 5  
Node 1 -> degree 5  
Node 4 -> degree 6  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:  
- Edge (0, 1): Nodes 0 and 1 have 5 common neighbors which leads to 5 triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>  
- Edge (0, 2): Nodes 0 and 2 have 2 common neighbors which leads to 2 triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>  
- Edge (0, 4): Nodes 0 and 4 have 4 common neighbors which leads to 4 triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 8>  
- Edge (0, 5): No triangles are formed as the condition of the lower label having fewer connections isn't met.  
- Edge (0, 8): Nodes 0 and 8 have 3 common neighbors which leads to 3 triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 8>  
- Edge (1, 4): Nodes 1 and 4 have 3 common neighbors which leads to 3 triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>  
- Edge (1, 7): No triangles are formed as the condition of the lower label having fewer connections isn't met.  
- Edge (1, 8): Nodes 1 and 8 have 2 common neighbors which leads to 2 triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <1, 4, 8>  
- Edge (1, 9): Nodes 1 and 9 have 2 common neighbors which leads to 2 triangles: <0, 1, 9>, <1, 4, 9>  
- Edge (2, 3): Nodes 2 and 3 have 1 common neighbor which leads to 1 triangle: <2, 4, 6>  
- Edge (2, 4): Nodes 2 and 4 have 2 common neighbors which leads to 2 triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>  
- Edge (3, 6): No triangles are formed as the condition of the lower label having fewer connections isn't met.  
- Edge (3, 7): No triangles are formed as the condition of the lower label having fewer connections isn't met.  
- Edge (4, 6): Nodes 4 and 6 have 2 common neighbors which leads to 2 triangles: <2, 4, 6>, <4, 8, 9>  
- Edge (4, 8): Nodes 4 and 8 have 3 common neighbors which leads to 3 triangles: <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <4, 8, 9>  
- Edge (4, 9): Nodes 4 and 9 have 2 common neighbors which leads to 2 triangles: <1, 4, 9>, <4, 8, 9>  
- Edge (5, 6): No triangles are formed as the condition of the lower label having fewer connections isn't met.  
- Edge (5, 9): No triangles are formed as the condition of the lower label having fewer connections isn't met.  
- Edge (6, 9): Nodes 6 and 9 have 2 common neighbors which leads to 2 triangles: <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>  
- Edge (7, 3): No triangles are formed as the condition of the lower label having fewer connections isn't met.  
- Edge (8, 9): Nodes 8 and 9 have 3 common neighbors which leads to 3 triangles: <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <4, 8, 9>  

Considering all the triangles found, the total number of triangles in the graph is [30].
