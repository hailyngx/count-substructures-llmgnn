Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree from least to most connections.

Sorted vertices: 7, 5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 2, 0, 6, 4

Now, we will examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Starting with vertex 7: 
- No edges connected to vertex 7 where the other vertex has fewer connections.

Moving on to vertex 5:
- No edges connected to vertex 5 where the other vertex has fewer connections.

Next is vertex 8:
- Edge (8, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 1.

Then, vertex 1:
- Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 2.
- Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 4.

Proceeding with vertex 3:
- Edge (3, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 0.
- Edge (3, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 6.

Now, vertex 9:
- Edge (9, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 4.
- Edge (9, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 5.
- Edge (9, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 6.

Moving on to vertex 2:
- Edge (2, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 1.
- Edge (2, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 4.
- Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 8.

Next is vertex 0:
- Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 3.
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 4.
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 5.
- Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 6.

Finally, vertex 6:
- Edge (6, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 3.
- Edge (6, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 0.
- Edge (6, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 2.
- Edge (6, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9.
- Edge (6, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 8.
- Edge (6, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 16.
