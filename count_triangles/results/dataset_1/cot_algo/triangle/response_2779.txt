Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Vertices: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 5, 9, 1, 8, 6

Now, we'll relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 -> 0 (Degree: 1)
2 -> 1 (Degree: 1)
3 -> 2 (Degree: 1)
4 -> 3 (Degree: 1)
7 -> 4 (Degree: 1)
5 -> 5 (Degree: 0)
9 -> 6 (Degree: 2)
1 -> 7 (Degree: 5)
8 -> 8 (Degree: 4)
6 -> 9 (Degree: 0)

Now, we will analyze each edge based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
(0, 1): Check the shared connections of 0 and 1 -> No triangles
(1, 0): Skipped as 1 has higher degree than 0
(1, 7): Check the shared connections of 1 and 7 -> Triangle <7, 1, 8>
(1, 8): Check the shared connections of 1 and 8 -> Triangles <1, 8, 4>, <1, 8, 9>
(1, 9): Check the shared connections of 1 and 9 -> No triangles
(2, 3): Check the shared connections of 2 and 3 -> No triangles
(3, 2): Skipped as 3 has higher degree than 2
(4, 8): Check the shared connections of 4 and 8 -> No triangles
(7, 1): Skipped as 7 has higher degree than 1
(8, 1): Skipped as 8 has higher degree than 1
(8, 4): Check the shared connections of 4 and 8 -> No triangles
(8, 9): Check the shared connections of 8 and 9 -> No triangles
(9, 1): Skipped as 9 has higher degree than 1
(9, 8): Skipped as 9 has higher degree than 8

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <7, 1, 8>, <1, 8, 4>, and <1, 8, 9>.
