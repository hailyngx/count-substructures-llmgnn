Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on their number of connections:

Vertices: 
1. 1 (Degree: 1)
2. 4 (Degree: 2)
3. 7 (Degree: 2)
4. 9 (Degree: 1)
5. 3 (Degree: 2)
6. 5 (Degree: 4)
7. 8 (Degree: 3)
8. 0 (Degree: 6)
9. 6 (Degree: 5)
10. 2 (Degree: 4)

Using the edges provided, we identify triangles based on shared connections:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
