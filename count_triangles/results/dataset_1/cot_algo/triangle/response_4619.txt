Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are as follows:
Node 8 has 0 connection(s).
Node 1 has 1 connection(s).
Node 5 has 1 connection(s).
Node 1 has 1 connection(s).
Node 5 has 1 connection(s).
Node 7 has 2 connection(s).
Node 6 has 4 connection(s).
Node 3 has 4 connection(s).
Node 2 has 4 connection(s).
Node 4 has 5 connection(s).
Node 0 has 8 connection(s).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering Method:
Checking the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Count of triangles: [12]
