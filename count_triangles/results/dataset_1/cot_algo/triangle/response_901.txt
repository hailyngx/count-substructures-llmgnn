Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections. The sorted vertices are: 4, 9, 7, 1, 8, 0, 3, 5, 2.

Now, we will count the triangles based on the given edges:
- (0, 4) and (0, 5) share a connection at vertex 0, forming a triangle <0, 4, 5>.
- (0, 4) and (0, 8) share a connection at vertex 0, forming a triangle <0, 4, 8>.
- No triangles from (0, 5) and (0, 8).

- No triangles from (1, 2), (1, 5), and (1, 7).

- (2, 1) and (2, 3) share a connection at vertex 2, forming a triangle <1, 2, 3>.
- (2, 7) and (2, 8) share a connection at vertex 2, forming a triangle <1, 2, 7>.
- No triangles from (2, 3) and (2, 8).

- (3, 2) and (3, 5) share a connection at vertex 3, forming a triangle <2, 3, 5>.
- No triangles from (3, 7) and (3, 9).

- No triangles from (4, 0).
- No triangles from (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 8).
- No triangles from (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3).
- No triangles from (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5).
- No triangles from (9, 3), (9, 7).

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 7>, and <2, 3, 5>.
