Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 2 (Degree 1)
- Node 5 (Degree 1)
- Node 4 (Degree 2)
- Node 8 (Degree 2)
- Node 3 (Degree 3)
- Node 9 (Degree 3)
- Node 1 (Degree 4)
- Node 6 (Degree 4)
- Node 7 (Degree 5)
- Node 0 (Degree 6)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges:

1. Edge (2, 8): Skipped as the lower-labeled vertex has a higher degree.
2. Edge (5, 7): Skipped as the lower-labeled vertex has a higher degree.
3. Edge (2, 8): Skipped as the lower-labeled vertex has a higher degree.
4. Edge (3, 0): Triangle <0, 3, 1> found.
5. Edge (0, 6): Triangle <0, 6, 1> found.
6. Edge (0, 7): Triangle <0, 7, 1> found.
7. Edge (1, 3): Triangle <1, 3, 0> found.
8. Edge (1, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 6> found.
9. Edge (1, 6): Triangle <1, 6, 0> found.
10. Edge (1, 9): Triangle <1, 9, 6> found.
11. Edge (3, 1): Skipped as the lower-labeled vertex has a higher degree.
12. Edge (4, 1): Triangle <1, 4, 6> found.
13. Edge (5, 7): Skipped as the lower-labeled vertex has a higher degree.
14. Edge (6, 0): Triangle <0, 6, 1> found.
15. Edge (6, 1): Triangle <1, 6, 0> found.
16. Edge (6, 9): Triangle <6, 9, 1> found.
17. Edge (7, 0): Triangle <0, 7, 1> found.
18. Edge (7, 5): Skipped as the lower-labeled vertex has a higher degree.
19. Edge (7, 8): Triangle <7, 8, 1> found.
20. Edge (7, 9): Triangle <7, 9, 1> found.
21. Edge (8, 2): Skipped as the lower-labeled vertex has a higher degree.
22. Edge (8, 7): Triangle <7, 8, 1> found.
23. Edge (9, 1): Triangle <1, 9, 6> found.
24. Edge (9, 6): Triangle <6, 9, 1> found.
25. Edge (9, 7): Triangle <7, 9, 1> found.
