Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: <3, 5, 0, 4, 1, 8, 2, 6, 9, 7>.

Now, we will go through the edges (in the same order they were provided) and count the number of triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (0, 6): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (0, 8): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (1, 2): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (1, 4): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (1, 6): Triangle <1, 6, 0>.
- Edge (2, 1): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (2, 8): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (2, 9): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (3, 8): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (4, 1): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (4, 5): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (5, 4): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (6, 0): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (6, 1): Triangle <6, 1, 4>.
- Edge (6, 8): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (6, 9): Triangle <6, 9, 2>.
- Edge (7, 8): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (7, 9): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (8, 0): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (8, 2): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (8, 3): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (8, 6): Triangle <8, 6, 1>.
- Edge (8, 7): Triangle <8, 7, 9>.
- Edge (9, 2): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (9, 6): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (9, 7): No triangle can be formed.

Count of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <1, 6, 0>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 9, 2>, <8, 7, 9>.
