Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, we have: 

Vertices: 7, 8, 0, 1, 2, 9, 3, 6, 5, 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles by analyzing each edge:

1. Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1 and 2. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 0 and 6. Vertices 0, 1, and 6 form a triangle. 
2. Edge (0, 2): No triangle is formed.
3. Edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 0 and 6. Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 1, 4, and 8. Vertices 1, 6, and 4 form a triangle.
4. Edge (2, 0): No triangle is formed.
5. Edge (2, 3): No triangle is formed.
6. Edge (3, 9): No triangle is formed.
7. Edge (4, 5): Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 5, 6, 8, and 9. Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 4, 7, and 9. Vertices 4, 5, and 9 form a triangle.
8. Edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 5, 6, 8, and 9. Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 1, 4, and 8. Vertices 4, 6, and 8 form a triangle.
9. Edge (4, 8): No triangle is formed.
10. Edge (4, 9): No triangle is formed.
11. Edge (5, 7): No triangle is formed.
12. Edge (5, 9): No triangle is formed.
13. Edge (6, 8): No triangle is formed.
14. Edge (8, 6): No triangle is formed.
15. Edge (9, 5): No triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <1, 6, 4>, and <4, 5, 9>.
