Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
(1) 1 -> 2 connections
(4) 8 -> 1 connections
(0) 0 -> 3 connections
(6) 5 -> 3 connections
(3) 6 -> 3 connections
(2) 7 -> 4 connections
(9) 9 -> 4 connections
(5) 4 -> 4 connections
(7) 3 -> 5 connections
(8) 1 -> 0 connections

Now, starting from the vertex with the lowest degree (1), we go through the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to find triangles.

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
