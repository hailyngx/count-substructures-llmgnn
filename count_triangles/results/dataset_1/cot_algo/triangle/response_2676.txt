Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0: Degree 1
- Vertex 2: Degree 1
- Vertex 8: Degree 2
- Vertex 4: Degree 3
- Vertex 7: Degree 3
- Vertex 1: Degree 4
- Vertex 5: Degree 4
- Vertex 6: Degree 4
- Vertex 9: Degree 5
- Vertex 3: Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:
Within the given edges, the triangles are:
1. <3, 4, 9>
2. <3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
