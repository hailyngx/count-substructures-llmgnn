Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:
```
Vertex 1 - 2 connections
Vertex 5 - 1 connection
Vertex 6 - 1 connection
Vertex 8 - 2 connections
Vertex 9 - 2 connections
Vertex 0 - 3 connections
Vertex 7 - 2 connections
Vertex 2 - 4 connections
Vertex 3 - 3 connections
```

Now, considering each edge with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 1): Both vertices share connections with vertex 7, forming a triangle <0, 1, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 7): Both vertices share connections with vertices 1 and 8, forming two triangles <0, 1, 7> and <0, 7, 8>.
3. Edge (0, 8): Both vertices share connections with vertex 7, forming a triangle <0, 7, 8>.

Hence, the total number of triangles is [3].
