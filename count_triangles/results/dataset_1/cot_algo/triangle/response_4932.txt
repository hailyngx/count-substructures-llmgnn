Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following relabeling:
```
Vertex 2 has 1 connection.
Vertex 6 has 1 connection.
Vertex 0 has 2 connections.
Vertex 1 has 2 connections.
Vertex 7 has 3 connections.
Vertex 5 has 4 connections.
Vertex 9 has 4 connections.
Vertex 8 has 4 connections.
Vertex 3 has 5 connections.
Vertex 4 has 5 connections.
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 1): Both 0 and 1 have 2 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 8
   - Triangle: <0, 1, 8>

2. Edge (0, 8): 0 has 2 connections and 8 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 1
   - Triangle: <0, 1, 8>

3. Edge (1, 8): 1 has 2 connections and 8 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 0
   - Triangle: <0, 1, 8>

4. Edge (2, 4): Both 2 and 4 have 1 connection, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

5. Edge (3, 4): 3 has 5 connections and 4 has 5 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

6. Edge (3, 5): 3 has 5 connections and 5 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 9
   - Triangle: <3, 5, 9>

7. Edge (3, 9): 3 has 5 connections and 9 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

8. Edge (4, 2): 4 has 5 connections and 2 has 1 connection, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

9. Edge (4, 3): 4 has 5 connections and 3 has 5 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

10. Edge (4, 7): 4 has 5 connections and 7 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

11. Edge (5, 3): 5 has 4 connections and 3 has 5 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 9
   - Triangle: <3, 5, 9>

12. Edge (5, 7): 5 has 4 connections and 7 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

13. Edge (5, 9): 5 has 4 connections and 9 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

14. Edge (6, 9): Both 6 and 9 have 4 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

15. Edge (7, 4): 7 has 3 connections and 4 has 5 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

16. Edge (7, 5): 7 has 3 connections and 5 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

   - Shared connections: None

19. Edge (8, 1): 8 has 4 connections and 1 has 2 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

20. Edge (8, 7): 8 has 4 connections and 7 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

21. Edge (9, 3): 9 has 4 connections and 3 has 5 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

22. Edge (9, 5): 9 has 4 connections and 5 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

23. Edge (9, 6): 9 has 4 connections and 6 has 1 connection, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: None

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we have found a total of 2 triangles: <0, 1, 8> and <3, 5, 9>.
The total number of triangles is [2].
