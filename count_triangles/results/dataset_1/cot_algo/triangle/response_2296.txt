Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 1: 3 connections (node 8)
Node 2: 3 connections (node 4)
Node 3: 3 connections (node 7)
Node 4: 3 connections (node 9)
Node 5: 4 connections (node 1)
Node 6: 4 connections (node 6)
Node 7: 4 connections (node 2)
Node 8: 4 connections (node 3)
Node 9: 5 connections (node 0)
Node 10: 5 connections (node 5)

Now, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles in the graph:

1. Checking edge (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 have 3 common neighbors (nodes 1, 6, 8). So, there is one triangle <0, 5, 1>.

2. Checking edge (0, 6): Nodes 0 and 6 have no common neighbors. Therefore, no triangle is formed using this edge.

3. Checking edge (0, 8): Nodes 0 and 8 have 3 common neighbors (nodes 5, 6, 7). So, there is one triangle <0, 8, 5>.

4. Checking edge (1, 4): Nodes 1 and 4 have no common neighbors. Therefore, no triangle is formed using this edge.

5. Checking edge (1, 5): Nodes 1 and 5 have 2 common neighbors (nodes 0, 9). So, there is one triangle <1, 5, 0>.

6. Checking edge (2, 6): Nodes 2 and 6 have no common neighbors. Therefore, no triangle is formed using this edge.

7. Checking edge (2, 8): Nodes 2 and 8 have 1 common neighbor (node 7). So, there is one triangle <2, 8, 7>.

8. Checking edge (2, 9): Nodes 2 and 9 have 1 common neighbor (node 3). So, there is one triangle <2, 9, 3>.

9. Checking edge (3, 4): Nodes 3 and 4 have no common neighbors. Therefore, no triangle is formed using this edge.

10. Checking edge (3, 9): Nodes 3 and 9 have no common neighbors. Therefore, no triangle is formed using this edge.

11. Checking edge (4, 1): Nodes 4 and 1 have no common neighbors. Therefore, no triangle is formed using this edge.

12. Checking edge (4, 3): Nodes 4 and 3 have no common neighbors. Therefore, no triangle is formed using this edge.

13. Checking edge (5, 0): Already counted.

14. Checking edge (5, 1): Already counted.

15. Checking edge (5, 7): Nodes 5 and 7 have no common neighbors. Therefore, no triangle is formed using this edge.

16. Checking edge (5, 9): Nodes 5 and 9 have 1 common neighbor (node 0). So, there is one triangle <5, 9, 0>.

17. Checking edge (6, 0): Already checked.

18. Checking edge (6, 2): Already checked.

19. Checking edge (6, 7): Nodes 6 and 7 have no common neighbors. Therefore, no triangle is formed using this edge.

20. Checking edge (7, 5): Already checked.

21. Checking edge (7, 6): Already checked.

22. Checking edge (7, 8): Nodes 7 and 8 have no common neighbors. Therefore, no triangle is formed using this edge.

23. Checking edge (8, 0): Already checked.

24. Checking edge (8, 2): Already checked.

25. Checking edge (8, 7): Already checked.

26. Checking edge (9, 2): Already checked.

27. Checking edge (9, 3): Already checked.

28. Checking edge (9, 5): Already checked.

As a result, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 1>, <0, 8, 5>, <2, 8, 7>, and <2, 9, 3>.
