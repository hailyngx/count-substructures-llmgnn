Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting vertices by their degrees:
Node 0: 3 edges
Node 2: 2 edges
Node 6: 2 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 5: 6 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 8: 5 edges
Node 1: 5 edges
Node 9: 5 edges

After relabeling the nodes:
0 → 2
2 → 0
6 → 1
7 → 3
4 → 4
5 → 5
3 → 6
8 → 7
1 → 8
9 → 9
