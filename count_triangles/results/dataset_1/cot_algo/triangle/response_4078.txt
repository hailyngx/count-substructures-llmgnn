Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we'll sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degrees:
0 (degree 1)
7 (degree 1)
5 (degree 2)
1 (degree 2)
8 (degree 2)
6 (degree 2)
4 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
9 (degree 5)
2 (degree 5)

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on the sorted order:
0 -> 0
7 -> 1
5 -> 2
1 -> 3
8 -> 4
6 -> 5
4 -> 6
3 -> 7
9 -> 8
2 -> 9

Next, we will examine each edge (u, v) where u is the vertex with the lower label.

Triangles found:
<1, 3, 7>
<4, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
