Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given graph after applying Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertices sorted by number of connections:  
1. 5 with degree 2
2. 6 with degree 2
3. 1 with degree 2
4. 9 with degree 2
5. 0 with degree 2
6. 2 with degree 3
7. 4 with degree 3
8. 8 with degree 3
9. 7 with degree 4
10. 3 with degree 4

Using the method described, we will now check for triangles:
Triangles:
[15]

Unique triangles:
<0, 7, 8>
