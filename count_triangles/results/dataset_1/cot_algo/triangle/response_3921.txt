Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Node 1 (degree 0): 4
Node 8 (degree 0): 6
Node 9 (degree 2): 1
Node 0 (degree 2): 2
Node 4 (degree 2): 3
Node 1 (degree 2): 5
Node 1 (degree 2): 7
Node 1 (degree 3): 0
Node 1 (degree 4): 8
Node 1 (degree 4): 9

Now, we will identify the triangles:

- Triangle <0, 2, 7>
- Triangle <3, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
