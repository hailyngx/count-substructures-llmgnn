Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we can relabel them accordingly:

Vertices with their connections:
0: 1 connection
0: (6)

7: 1 connection
7: (1)

4: 2 connections
4: 

8: 3 connections
8: (2, 5, 6)

9: 3 connections
9: (5, 6, 8)

1: 4 connections
1: (2, 6, 7)

2: 4 connections
2: (1, 3, 8)

3: 4 connections
3: (2, 5, 6)

5: 5 connections
5: (3, 6, 8, 9)

6: 6 connections
6: (0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9)

Now we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <1, 2, 6>
2. <1, 6, 7>
3. <2, 3, 6>
4. <2, 6, 8>
5. <3, 5, 6>
6. <5, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
