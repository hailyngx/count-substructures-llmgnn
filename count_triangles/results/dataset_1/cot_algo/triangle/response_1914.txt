Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices with their degrees in increasing order:

Vertices:  
0: degree 1  
3: degree 1  
4: degree 1  
6: degree 1  
8: degree 1  
9: degree 2  
5: degree 3  
1: degree 4  
2: degree 4  

Since all connections involve vertices that can potentially form triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we can proceed with counting triangles using the shared connections:

Triangles:  
<1, 5, 9>  
<1, 5, 6>  
<1, 8, 9>  
<2, 0, 4>  
<2, 3, 4>  
<1, 9, 5>

Total number of triangles: [6]
