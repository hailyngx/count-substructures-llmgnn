Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order and relabeling them accordingly, the new numbering is as follows:
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 6 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now examine each edge considering only the cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Analyzing the edges:
(0, 2) - Nodes 0 and 2 share a connection with node 4 forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
(0, 4) - No triangles are formed.
(0, 9) - No triangles are formed.
(1, 3) - No triangles are formed.
(1, 8) - No triangles are formed.
(2, 3) - No triangles are formed.
(3, 1) - No triangles are formed.
(3, 2) - No triangles are formed.
(4, 0) - No triangles are formed.
(4, 5) - No triangles are formed.
(4, 7) - No triangles are formed.
(4, 8) - Nodes 4 and 8 share connections with nodes 5 and 7 forming triangles <4, 5, 8> and <4, 7, 8>.
(5, 4) - No triangles are formed.
(5, 6) - No triangles are formed.
(5, 7) - No triangles are formed.
(6, 3) - No triangles are formed.
(6, 5) - No triangles are formed.
(6, 7) - Nodes 6 and 7 share a connection with node 5 forming a triangle <6, 7, 5>.
(7, 4) - No triangles are formed.
(7, 5) - No triangles are formed.
(7, 6) - No triangles are formed.
(8, 1) - No triangles are formed.
(8, 2) - No triangles are formed.
(8, 4) - Nodes 8 and 4 share connections with nodes 5 and 7 forming triangles <8, 5, 4> and <8, 7, 4>.
(8, 5) - No triangles are formed.
(8, 7) - No triangles are formed.
(8, 9) - No triangles are formed.
(9, 0) - No triangles are formed.
(9, 4) - No triangles are formed.
(9, 8) - No triangles are formed.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, and <6, 7, 5>.
