Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 3 -> Label 0
Node 6 -> Label 1
Node 1 -> Label 2
Node 5 -> Label 3
Node 7 -> Label 4
Node 9 -> Label 5
Node 8 -> Label 6
Node 4 -> Label 7
Node 0 -> Label 8
Node 2 -> Label 9

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the following triangles:

[11]
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 2>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 8, 3>
