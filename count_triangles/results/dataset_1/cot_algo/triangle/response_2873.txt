Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices can be sorted based on their degree as follows:
Vertices: 4, 3, 9, 7, 5, 0, 1, 6, 8, 2

Now, reordering the edges based on the new vertex numbering:
Edges: (4, 8) (3, 9) (9, 1) (7, 6) (5, 8) (0, 1) (1, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (2, 0) (6, 2) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (6, 7) (8, 6) (2, 1) (8, 4) (2, 6) (7, 0) (2, 0) (0, 2) (5, 2) (9, 3)

Now, counting the triangles formed by the edges:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle 2: <8, 4, 5>
- Triangle 3: <1, 2, 9>
- Triangle 4: <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
