Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we have the following relabeled vertices: 

- Vertex 0 has degree 3
- Vertex 1 has degree 2
- Vertex 4 has degree 1
- Vertex 6 has degree 3
- Vertex 8 has degree 2
- Vertex 5 has degree 3
- Vertex 7 has degree 4
- Vertex 9 has degree 3
- Vertex 2 has degree 4
- Vertex 3 has degree 7

Based on the instructions, we start with the edge involving the lowest labeled vertex and only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Examining the edges, we find the following triangles: 
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <3, 7, 4>
- <5, 7, 4>

Counting all unique triangles and listing them inside <> gives: 
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 4>, <5, 7, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
