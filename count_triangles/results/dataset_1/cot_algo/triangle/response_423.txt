Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows:
Vertices: 5, 4, 1, 9, 8, 3, 6, 7, 0, 2

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

Triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
