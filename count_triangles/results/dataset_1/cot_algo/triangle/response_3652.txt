Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are:
0 (degree 2), 1 (degree 5), 3 (degree 2), 6 (degree 2), 4 (degree 4), 8 (degree 4), 7 (degree 4), 5 (degree 4), 2 (degree 5), 9 (degree 5).

Based on Degree-Based Ordering, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 8), (8, 9).

Counting the triangles formed by these edges results in the following:
Total number of triangles: [14]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 7>, <6, 9, 1>.
