Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for each vertex are:
Node 2 (degree 1)
Node 9 (degree 1)
Node 4 (degree 2)
Node 5 (degree 2)
Node 0 (degree 3)
Node 1 (degree 3)
Node 8 (degree 4)
Node 6 (degree 4)
Node 3 (degree 5)
Node 7 (degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we look at each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 1): Nodes 0 and 1 have 3 connections in common (3, 8, 7) forming the triangle <0, 1, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 3): Nodes 0 and 3 have 2 connections in common (3, 8) forming the triangle <0, 3, 8>.
3. Edge (0, 8): Nodes 0 and 8 have 2 connections in common (3, 8) forming the triangle <0, 3, 8>.
4. Edge (1, 3): Nodes 1 and 3 have 2 connections in common (3, 8) forming the triangle <1, 3, 8>.
5. Edge (1, 7): Nodes 1 and 7 have 2 connections in common (7, 4) forming the triangle <1, 7, 4>.
6. Edge (3, 8): Nodes 3 and 8 have 3 connections in common (0, 1, 8) forming the triangle <3, 0, 1>.
7. Edge (4, 5): Nodes 4 and 5 have no connections in common.
8. Edge (4, 7): Nodes 4 and 7 have 1 connection in common (7) forming the triangle <4, 7, 1>.
9. Edge (5, 7): Nodes 5 and 7 have 1 connection in common (7) forming the triangle <5, 7, 1>.
10. Edge (6, 2): Nodes 6 and 2 have no connections in common.
11. Edge (6, 7): Nodes 6 and 7 have 1 connection in common (7) forming the triangle <6, 7, 1>.
12. Edge (6, 8): Nodes 6 and 8 have 2 connections in common (7, 8) forming the triangle <6, 8, 7>.
13. Edge (7, 9): Nodes 7 and 9 have no connections in common.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 7, 4>
<3, 0, 1>
<4, 7, 1>
<6, 8, 7>
