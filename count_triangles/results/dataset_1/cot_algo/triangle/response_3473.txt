Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are:
- Vertex 3 (Degree 1)
- Vertex 6 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 7 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 0 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 5 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 1 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 8 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 4 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 9 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 2 (Degree 5)

Now, we can count the number of triangles by examining each edge:

1. Edge (0, 1): Shared connections with vertex 0: [2, 5], forms triangle <0, 1, 2>.
2. Edge (0, 2): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (0, 5): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 4): Shared connections with vertex 1: [9], forms triangle <1, 0, 9>.
5. Edge (1, 9): Shared connections with vertex 1: [0, 2], forms triangle <1, 9, 0>.
6. Edge (2, 4): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 9): Shared connections with vertex 2: [0], forms triangle <2, 9, 0>.
8. Edge (3, 4): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (4, 6): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (4, 3): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (4, 1): Shared connections with vertex 4: [2], forms triangle <4, 1, 2>.
13. Edge (4, 2): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (5, 0): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (5, 9): Shared connections with vertex 5: [0], forms triangle <5, 9, 0>.
16. Edge (6, 4): Shared connections with vertex 6: [8], forms triangle <6, 4, 8>.
17. Edge (6, 8): Shared connections with vertex 6: [4], forms triangle <6, 8, 4>.
18. Edge (8, 2): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (8, 6): No triangle formed.
20. Edge (8, 9): Shared connections with vertex 8: [2, 6], forms triangle <8, 9, 2>.
21. Edge (9, 1): Shared connections with vertex 9: [0], forms triangle <9, 1, 0>.
22. Edge (9, 2): No triangle formed.
23. Edge (9, 5): No triangle formed.

Adding up the identified triangles:
- Total number of triangles: [8]
- Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 0, 9>, <1, 9, 0>, <2, 9, 0>, <4, 1, 2>, <5, 9, 0>, <6, 8, 4>, <8, 9, 2>
