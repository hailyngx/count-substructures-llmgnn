Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels are: 
Node 7, degree = 1  
Node 5, degree = 1  
Node 8, degree = 1  
Node 3, degree = 2  
Node 0, degree = 3  
Node 2, degree = 4  
Node 1, degree = 4  
Node 4, degree = 5  
Node 9, degree = 6  
Node 6, degree = 6  

Now, we count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:  
- No triangles found between nodes 7 and 5.  
- No triangles found between nodes 7 and 8.  
- No triangles found between nodes 5 and 8.  
- No triangles found between nodes 3 and 0.  
- No triangles found between nodes 3 and 2.  
- No triangles found between nodes 3 and 1.  
- No triangles found between nodes 3 and 4.  
- Found triangle <4, 9, 6>.  
- No triangles found between nodes 7 and 9.  
- No triangles found between nodes 7 and 6.  
- No triangles found between nodes 5 and 9.  
- No triangles found between nodes 5 and 6.  
- Found triangle <0, 6, 9>.  
- Found triangle <6, 4, 9>.  
- No triangles found between nodes 8 and 3.  
- No triangles found between nodes 8 and 0.  
- No triangles found between nodes 8 and 2.  
- No triangles found between nodes 8 and 1.  
- No triangles found between nodes 1 and 7.  
- Found triangle <1, 4, 9>.  
- Found triangle <1, 0, 6>.  
- Found triangle <1, 2, 4>.  
- No triangles found between nodes 1 and 5.  
- No triangles found between nodes 4 and 7.  
- Found triangle <4, 6, 9>.  
- No triangles found between nodes 5 and 3.  
- No triangles found between nodes 4 and 5.  

Total number of triangles: [6]
