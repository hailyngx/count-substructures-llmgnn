Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 3 (Degree: 1)
Node 0 (Degree: 1)
Node 7 (Degree: 1)
Node 4 (Degree: 2)
Node 5 (Degree: 2)
Node 8 (Degree: 2)
Node 1 (Degree: 3)
Node 6 (Degree: 4)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles:
For edge (0, 3):
- The lower label node is 0 with degree 1, which is less than 1. Therefore, we proceed.
- Node 0 and node 3 share a connection, forming a triangle with node 0 --> 3 --> 0. 

For edge (1, 6):
- The lower label node is 1 with degree 3, which is less than 4. Therefore, we proceed.
- Node 1 and node 6 do not share a connection, so no triangle is formed.

For edge (1, 7):
- The lower label node is 1 with degree 3, which is less than 1. Therefore, we proceed.
- Node 1 and node 7 do not share a connection, so no triangle is formed.

For edge (4, 5):
- The lower label node is 4 with degree 2, which is less than 2. Therefore, we proceed.
- Node 4 and node 5 share a connection, forming a triangle with node 4 --> 5 --> 4.

For edge (4, 6):
- The lower label node is 4 with degree 2, which is less than 4. Therefore, we proceed.
- Node 4 and node 6 do not share a connection, so no triangle is formed.

For edge (6, 8):
- The lower label node is 6 with degree 4, which is more than 2. Therefore, we do not proceed.

The triangles found are <0, 3, 0> and <4, 5, 4>.
The total number of triangles is [2].
