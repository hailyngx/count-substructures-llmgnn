Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 5: 2 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections

Since there are 28 edges, we will now count the triangles. We will start by listing the unique triangles found:

<4, 2, 3>
<9, 6, 8>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 7, 5>
<6, 7, 5>
<6, 9, 8>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 2>
<7, 0, 1>
<7, 3, 8>

After accounting for each triangle, we can see there are 12 unique triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
