Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the updated labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 4 has 0 connections.
- Vertices 5 and 9 have 0 connections.
- Vertices 2 and 8 have 1 connection.
- Vertices 3 and 7 have 4 connections.
- Vertices 0 and 1 have 5 connections.
- Vertex 6 has 6 connections.

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <0, 6, 1>
2. <0, 7, 1>
3. <0, 8, 1>
4. <6, 0, 1>
5. <7, 0, 1>
6. <8, 0, 1>

Total number of triangles: [6]
