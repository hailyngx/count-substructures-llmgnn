Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows: 

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 6

Now, we can proceed with counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The total number of triangles is [9].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
