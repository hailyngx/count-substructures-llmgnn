Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices in the graph are:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, we will sort the vertices based on the number of connections they have:
8 has 1 connection
3 has 2 connections
4 has 2 connections
5 has 2 connections
8 has 2 connections
6 has 3 connections
7 has 6 connections
0 has 7 connections
9 has 7 connections
1 has 8 connections
2 has 8 connections

After relabeling the vertices based on the above sorting, the new labels are:
8, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6, 0, 9, 1, 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections.

Triangles found (in the format <vertex1, vertex2, vertex3>):
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
