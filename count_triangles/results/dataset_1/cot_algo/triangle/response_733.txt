Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order:

Vertex 3 connects to 0 nodes.
Vertices 7 and 2 connect to 1 node each.
Vertices 9 and 4 connect to 2 nodes each.
Vertices 1 and 0 connect to 3 nodes each.
Vertices 5 and 6 connect to 5 nodes each.
Vertex 8 connects to 6 nodes.

After relabeling the graph accordingly, the edges we consider are now: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (7, 8) (8, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9)

Now, we can count the number of triangles formed by finding shared connections:

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
