Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each node in the graph:

- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 4

Sorting the nodes by degree, we get the following relabeling:
1. Node 1 (Degree 2)
2. Node 3 (Degree 2)
3. Node 4 (Degree 2)
4. Node 5 (Degree 2)
5. Node 6 (Degree 2)
6. Node 7 (Degree 3)
7. Node 2 (Degree 3)
8. Node 8 (Degree 4)
9. Node 0 (Degree 4)
10. Node 9 (Degree 4)

Now, following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge to count the triangles:

Triangles:
1. <0, 8, 9>
2. <0, 8, 2>
3. <0, 9, 4>
4. <0, 9, 7>
5. <1, 0, 5>
6. <2, 0, 8>
7. <2, 0, 6>
8. <2, 8, 9>
9. <4, 5, 1>
10. <7, 3, 8>
11. <7, 3, 9>

Total number of triangles: [11]
