Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we'll sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Degrees: 4, 2, 3, 4, 3, 6, 5, 3, 1, 2

So, the new vertex labels will be:
Vertex: 9, 1, 2, 4, 6, 0, 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, we will go through the edges based on the new labels to count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
