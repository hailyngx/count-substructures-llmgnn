Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 2: degree = 2
- Node 3: degree = 1
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 3
- Node 6: degree = 1
- Node 7: degree = 2
- Node 8: degree = 1
- Node 9: degree = 1

Now, let's relabel the nodes according to their degrees:
- Node 3 (degree 1) -> Node 0
- Node 6 (degree 1) -> Node 1
- Node 8 (degree 1) -> Node 2
- Node 9 (degree 1) -> Node 3
- Node 2 (degree 2) -> Node 4
- Node 7 (degree 2) -> Node 5
- Node 5 (degree 3) -> Node 6
- Node 0 (degree 3) -> Node 7
- Node 4 (degree 4) -> Node 8
- Node 1 (degree 4) -> Node 9

Now, let's list the edges with the lower labeled vertex first:
- (0, 2) -> (7, 4)
- (0, 4) -> (7, 8)
- (0, 5) -> (7, 6)
- (2, 7) -> (4, 5)
- (4, 5) -> (8, 6)
- (4, 7) -> (8, 5)
- (4, 8) -> (8, 9)
- (5, 6) -> (6, 7)

Now, we can count the triangles formed by these edges:
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <5, 6, 7>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is **[8]**.
