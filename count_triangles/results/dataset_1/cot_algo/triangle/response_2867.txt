Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 1 (0)
Node 5 (1)
Node 4 (2)
Node 6 (3)
Node 2 (4)
Node 8 (5)
Node 7 (6)
Node 3 (7)
Node 10 (8)
Node 9 (9)

Using the degree-based ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles:
[15]
Unique triangles: <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <2, 9, 7>, <2, 0, 6>, <2, 0, 9>, <2, 0, 1>, <2, 0, 8>, <0, 6, 3>
