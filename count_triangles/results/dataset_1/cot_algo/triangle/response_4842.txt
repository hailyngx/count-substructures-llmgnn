Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 1 -> degree 3
Vertex 2 -> degree 1
Vertex 3 -> degree 3
Vertex 4 -> degree 1
Vertex 5 -> degree 5
Vertex 6 -> degree 4
Vertex 7 -> degree 2
Vertex 8 -> degree 1
Vertex 9 -> degree 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles:
1. (1, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 9. Triangle <1, 5, 9>.
2. (1, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 3. Triangle <1, 6, 3>.
3. (1, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 5. Triangle <1, 9, 5>.
4. (3, 4) does not form a triangle. 
5. (3, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 1. Triangle <3, 6, 1>.
6. (3, 8) does not form a triangle. 
7. (4, 3) does not form a triangle. 
8. (5, 1) has already been counted.
9. (5, 2) does not form a triangle.
10. (5, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 1. Triangle <5, 6, 1>.
11. (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
12. (5, 9) does not form a triangle. 
13. (6, 1) has already been counted.
14. (6, 3) has already been counted.
15. (6, 5) has already been counted.
16. (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
17. (7, 5) does not form a triangle.
18. (7, 6) does not form a triangle.
19. (8, 3) does not form a triangle. 
20. (9, 1) has already been counted. 
21. (9, 5) has already been counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 3>, and <5, 6, 1>.
