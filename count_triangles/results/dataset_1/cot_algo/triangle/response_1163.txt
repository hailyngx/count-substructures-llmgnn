Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method begins by sorting the vertices based on their degree, from lowest to highest:

Vertices: (Degree)
0: 4
8: 1
6: 2
9: 4
5: 3
7: 4
2: 4
1: 5
3: 5
4: 5

Relabeling the vertices based on their degree:

Node 8 (Degree 1) -> Node 0
Node 6 (Degree 2) -> Node 1
Node 5 (Degree 3) -> Node 2
Node 1 (Degree 4) -> Node 3
Node 3 (Degree 4) -> Node 4
Node 4 (Degree 4) -> Node 5
Node 0 (Degree 4) -> Node 6
Node 9 (Degree 4) -> Node 7
Node 7 (Degree 4) -> Node 8
Node 2 (Degree 4) -> Node 9

Using the degree-based ordering, we analyze each edge to count triangles:

1. (0, 1): Shared connections with 2 -> Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. (0, 2): No triangles
3. (0, 3): Shared connections with 1 -> Triangle <0, 1, 3>
4. (0, 7): No triangles
5. (1, 2): No triangles
6. (1, 3): No triangles
7. (1, 5): Shared connections with 2 -> Triangle <1, 2, 5>
8. (1, 8): No triangles
9. (2, 5): No triangles
10. (2, 7): No triangles
11. (3, 4): Shared connections with 0 and 1 -> Triangle <0, 3, 4>
12. (3, 6): No triangles
13. (4, 6): No triangles
14. (4, 7): Shared connections with 0 -> Triangle <0, 4, 7>
15. (4, 9): Shared connections with 1 -> Triangle <1, 4, 9>
16. (5, 9): No triangles
17. (6, 7): Shared connections with 0 -> Triangle <0, 6, 7>

[Total number of triangles: [5]]
Triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <1, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 7>
