Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 8 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections

Next, we relabel the vertices from 0 to 9 based on their degrees (from smallest to largest):

Vertex 3 -> 0
Vertex 4 -> 1
Vertex 5 -> 2
Vertex 1 -> 3
Vertex 2 -> 4
Vertex 6 -> 5
Vertex 9 -> 6
Vertex 7 -> 7
Vertex 0 -> 8
Vertex 8 -> 9

Now, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (0, 4): Form a triangle <0, 4, 8>
2. (0, 7): No triangle formed
3. (0, 8): No triangle formed
4. (1, 2): No triangle formed
5. (1, 8): No triangle formed
6. (2, 6): No triangle formed
7. (2, 6): No triangle formed
8. (4, 0): Form a triangle <0, 4, 8>
9. (5, 8): No triangle formed
10. (6, 2): No triangle formed
11. (6, 8): No triangle formed
12. (7, 0): No triangle formed
13. (7, 8): No triangle formed
14. (7, 9): No triangle formed
15. (8, 0): No triangle formed
16. (8, 1): No triangle formed
17. (8, 3): No triangle formed
18. (8, 5): No triangle formed
19. (8, 6): No triangle formed
20. (8, 7): No triangle formed
21. (8, 9): Form a triangle <0, 7, 8>
22. (9, 7): No triangle formed
23. (9, 8): Form a triangle <0, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 8> and <0, 7, 8>.
