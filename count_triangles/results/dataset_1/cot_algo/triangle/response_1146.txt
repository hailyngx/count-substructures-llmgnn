Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 8), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 4), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 5)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 1 (0): 2 edges
Node 2 (1): 0 edges
Node 3 (2): 0 edges
Node 4 (3): 3 edges
Node 5 (4): 2 edges
Node 6 (5): 3 edges
Node 7 (6): 2 edges
Node 8 (7): 3 edges
Node 9 (8): 2 edges
Node 10 (9): 0 edges

Now, we will relabel the nodes from 0 to 9 based on their degrees:

Node 2 (1): 0 edges
Node 3 (2): 0 edges
Node 1 (0): 2 edges
Node 4 (3): 2 edges
Node 7 (6): 2 edges
Node 5 (4): 2 edges
Node 8 (7): 2 edges
Node 6 (5): 3 edges
Node 9 (8): 3 edges
Node 10 (9): 3 edges

Next, we will count the triangles by looking at the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 8): Shared connections between 0 and 8: 5. Triangle: <0, 5, 8>
2. Edge (3, 5): Shared connections between 3 and 5: 7. Triangle: <3, 5, 7>

Finally, we count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 7>
