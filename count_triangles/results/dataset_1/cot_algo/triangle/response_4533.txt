Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node:  
Node 0: degree 5  
Node 1: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 3  
Node 3: degree 1  
Node 4: degree 2  
Node 5: degree 2  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 9: degree 5  

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:  
Nodes 3, 4, 5 (degree 1)  
Nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 (degree 3)  
Nodes 0, 9 (degree 5)  

Next, we will count the triangles:  
- Triangle <0, 1, 5>  
- Triangle <0, 1, 7>  
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>  
- Triangle <0, 2, 8>  
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>  
- Triangle <0, 8, 9>  
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>  
- Triangle <2, 6, 8>  
- Triangle <6, 9, 8>  
- Triangle <9, 4, 6>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
