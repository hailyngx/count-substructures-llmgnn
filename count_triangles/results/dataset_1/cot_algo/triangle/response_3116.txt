Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
- Vertex 0 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 3, 7, and 9 each have 2 connections.
- Vertex 1, 5, and 6 each have 3 connections.
- Vertex 2 and 8 each have 4 connections.
- Vertex 4 has 7 connections.

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on the degree-based ordering:
- Vertex 0 is now labeled as A with 2 connections.
- Vertex 1 is now labeled as B with 3 connections.
- Vertex 5 is now labeled as C with 3 connections.
- Vertex 6 is now labeled as D with 3 connections.
- Vertex 3 is now labeled as E with 2 connections.
- Vertex 7 is now labeled as F with 2 connections.
- Vertex 9 is now labeled as G with 2 connections.
- Vertex 2 is now labeled as H with 4 connections.
- Vertex 8 is now labeled as I with 4 connections.
- Vertex 4 is now labeled as J with 7 connections.

Next, we will go through the edges and find the triangles based on the rules provided:
- (0, 1): No triangles
- (0, 2): No triangles
- (1, 4): No triangles
- (1, 5): No triangles
- (2, 4): No triangles
- (2, 8): No triangles
- (3, 4): No triangles
- (3, 5): No triangles
- (4, 7): No triangles
- (4, 8): No triangles
- (6, 7): No triangles
- (6, 8): No triangles
- (6, 9): No triangles
- (8, 9): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [0].

Unique triangles found: None.
