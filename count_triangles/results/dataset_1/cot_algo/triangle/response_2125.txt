Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

0: degree = 2  
1: degree = 2  
3: degree = 1  
7: degree = 1  
9: degree = 2  
5: degree = 2  
6: degree = 3  
8: degree = 3  
4: degree = 4  
2: degree = 4  

Next, we will proceed based on the degree-based ordering:

1. Edge (0, 2): Both vertices have degree 2, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. (0, 2) forms triangle with node 8.  
2. Edge (0, 8): Both vertices have degree 2, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. No triangle formed.  
3. Edge (1, 4): Both vertices have degree 2, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. (1, 4) forms triangle with nodes 2 and 0.  
4. Edge (1, 5): Both vertices have degree 2, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. No triangle formed.  
5. Edge (2, 4): Node 4 has degree 4, so no triangle will be formed.  
6. Edge (2, 5): Both vertices have degree 2, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. (2, 5) forms triangle with nodes 1 and 4.  
7. Edge (2, 8): Both vertices have degree 2, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. No triangle formed.  
8. Edge (3, 8): Both vertices have degree 1, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. No triangle formed.  
9. Edge (4, 6): Node 6 has degree 3, so no triangle will be formed.  
10. Edge (4, 9): Both vertices have degree 2, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. No triangle formed.  
11. Edge (5, 2): Node 2 is higher degree than 5, so no triangle will be formed.  
12. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 is higher degree than 7, so no triangle will be formed.  
13. Edge (6, 9): Node 9 is higher degree than 6, so no triangle will be formed.  

The total number of triangles is [2], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4> and <1, 4, 2>.
