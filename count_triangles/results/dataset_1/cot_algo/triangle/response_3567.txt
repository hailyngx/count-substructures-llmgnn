Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we obtain the following list: 

Vertices: 
3 - 3 connections
1 - 2 connections
5 - 2 connections
7 - 2 connections
9 - 2 connections
0 - 4 connections
6 - 4 connections
4 - 5 connections
8 - 5 connections
2 - 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check each edge to count the number of triangles. 
Starting from the edge with the lowest labeled vertex:
1. (0, 2) forms a triangle with shared connections 4 and 8.
2. (0, 3) does not form a triangle as vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 3.
3. (0, 5) does not form a triangle as vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 5.
4. (0, 7) does not form a triangle as vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 7.
5. (1, 5) does not form a triangle as vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 5.
6. (1, 9) does not form a triangle as vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 9.
7. (2, 0) is already considered.
8. (2, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 8.
9. (2, 6) does not form a triangle as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 6.
10. (2, 8) does not form a triangle as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 8.
11. (3, 0) is already considered.
12. (3, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 8.
13. (3, 8) does not form a triangle as vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 8.
14. (4, 2) is already considered.
15. (4, 3) is already considered.
16. (4, 6) does not form a triangle as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 6.
17. (4, 8) does not form a triangle as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 8.
18. (4, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 8.
19. (5, 0) is already considered.
20. (5, 1) is already considered.
21. (6, 2) is already considered.
22. (6, 4) is already considered.
23. (6, 7) does not form a triangle as vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 7.
24. (6, 8) does not form a triangle as vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 8.
25. (7, 0) is already considered.
26. (7, 6) is already considered.
27. (8, 2) is already considered.
28. (8, 3) is already considered.
29. (8, 4) is already considered.
30. (8, 6) is already considered.
31. (8, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 4.
32. (9, 1) is already considered.
33. (9, 4) is already considered.
34. (9, 8) is already considered.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, and <2, 4, 8>.
