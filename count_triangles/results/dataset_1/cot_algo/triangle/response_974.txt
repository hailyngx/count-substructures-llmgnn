Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 2: 0
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 3
- Node 0: 4
- Node 3: 5
- Node 8: 6
- Node 1: 7
- Node 7: 8
- Node 9: 9

Now, we will list the edges in the order of the lower labeled node having fewer connections:
(2, 4)
(2, 5)
(4, 5)
(4, 1)
(5, 6)
(6, 3)
(2, 0)
(4, 9)
(5, 8)
(3, 5)
(0, 1)
(3, 6)
(6, 8)
(3, 7)
(0, 7)
(7, 8)
(8, 9)
(8, 9)
(7, 9)
(7, 9)

Now, let's count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<7, 8, 9>
