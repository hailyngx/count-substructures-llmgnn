Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

Sorted vertices by their number of connections:
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Now we proceed with counting triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2): Both have 4 connections, calculated triangles: None
2. Edge (0, 3): 0 and 3 have 5 connections, calculated triangles: None
3. Edge (0, 5): 0 and 5 have 5 connections, calculated triangles: <0, 3, 5>
4. Edge (0, 6): 0 has 6 connections and 6 has 4 connections, calculated triangles: None
5. Edge (1, 2): Both have 4 connections, calculated triangles: None
6. Edge (1, 4): 1 and 4 have 3 connections, calculated triangles: None
7. Edge (1, 5): 1 and 5 have 5 connections, calculated triangles: <1, 0, 5> and <1, 3, 5>
8. Edge (1, 6): 1 has 5 connections and 6 has 4 connections, calculated triangles: None
9. Edge (1, 8): 1 and 8 have 3 connections, calculated triangles: None
10. Edge (2, 7): 2 has 4 connections and 7 has 3 connections, calculated triangles: None
11. Edge (3, 4): 3 and 4 have 3 connections, calculated triangles: None
12. Edge (3, 5): 3 has 5 connections and 5 has 5 connections, calculated triangles: <3, 0, 5>
13. Edge (3, 6): 3 and 6 have 4 connections, calculated triangles: None
14. Edge (3, 7): Both have 3 connections, calculated triangles: None
15. Edge (4, 5): 4 and 5 have 5 connections, calculated triangles: <4, 1, 5>
16. Edge (5, 8): 5 has 5 connections and 8 has 3 connections, calculated triangles: None
17. Edge (7, 9): Both have 1 connection, calculated triangles: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <1, 0, 5>, and <1, 3, 5>.
