Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 0: degree of 3
- Vertex 1: degree of 4
- Vertex 2: degree of 2
- Vertex 3: degree of 1
- Vertex 5: degree of 2
- Vertex 6: degree of 3
- Vertex 7: degree of 1
- Vertex 8: degree of 1
- Vertex 9: degree of 4

Next, we relabel the vertices based on their degree:
- Vertex 3 (degree 1) becomes vertex 0
- Vertex 5 (degree 2) becomes vertex 1
- Vertex 2 (degree 2) becomes vertex 2
- Vertex 6 (degree 3) becomes vertex 3
- Vertex 8 (degree 1) becomes vertex 4
- Vertex 7 (degree 1) becomes vertex 5
- Vertex 0 (degree 3) becomes vertex 6
- Vertex 1 (degree 4) becomes vertex 7
- Vertex 9 (degree 4) becomes vertex 8

Now, we check each edge. Since we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we consider the following edges:
- (0, 1) becomes (6, 7) forming a triangle with vertex 0 (6), vertex 1 (7), vertex 9 (8) <6, 7, 8>
- (0, 7) becomes (6, 5) forming a triangle with vertex 0 (6), vertex 7 (5), vertex 1 (7) <6, 5, 7>
- (0, 9) becomes (6, 8) forming a triangle with vertex 0 (6), vertex 1 (7), vertex 9 (8) <6, 7, 8>
- (1, 3) becomes (7, 0) forming a triangle with vertex 3 (0), vertex 1 (7), vertex 8 (8) <0, 7, 8>
- (2, 5) becomes (1, 2) forming a triangle with vertex 2 (1), vertex 5 (2), vertex 6 (3) <1, 2, 3>
- (7, 0) becomes (5, 6) forming a triangle with vertex 0 (6), vertex 1 (7), vertex 7 (5) <6, 5, 7>
- (8, 1) becomes (4, 7) forming a triangle with vertex 1 (7), vertex 8 (4), vertex 9 (8) <7, 4, 8>
- (9, 0) becomes (8, 6) forming a triangle with vertex 0 (6), vertex 1 (7), vertex 9 (8) <6, 7, 8>
- (9, 1) becomes (8, 7) forming a triangle with vertex 1 (7), vertex 8 (4), vertex 9 (8) <7, 4, 8>
- (9, 6) becomes (8, 3) forming a triangle with vertex 6 (3), vertex 9 (8), vertex 1 (7) <3, 8, 7>

Counting the total number of triangles, we find there are [6] triangles in total.
