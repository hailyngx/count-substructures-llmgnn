Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labels are as follows:
Node 6 (Degree 1)
Node 5 (Degree 1)
Node 8 (Degree 1)
Node 2 (Degree 2)
Node 5 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 3)
Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 9 (Degree 4)

Now, we can traverse through the edges in the graph and count the triangles:
- For the edge (0, 1): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (0, 7): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (0, 9): Triangles <0, 7, 9> and <0, 1, 9> are formed.
- For the edge (1, 4): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (1, 5): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (2, 3): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (2, 4): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (3, 7): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (3, 9): Triangle <0, 3, 9> is formed.
- For the edge (4, 8): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (5, 1): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (6, 7): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (7, 3): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (7, 6): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (8, 4): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (8, 9): No triangles are formed.
- For the edge (9, 0): Triangles <0, 7, 9> and <0, 1, 9> are formed.
- For the edge (9, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 9> is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is 5, and the unique triangles found are <0, 7, 9>, <0, 1, 9>, and <0, 3, 9>. 
The final output is [5].
