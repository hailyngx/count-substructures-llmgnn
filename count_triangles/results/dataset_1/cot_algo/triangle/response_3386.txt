Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
1. Node 1: 1 connection
2. Node 5: 1 connection
3. Node 7: 1 connection
4. Node 2: 2 connections
5. Node 8: 2 connections
6. Node 6: 4 connections
7. Node 4: 5 connections
8. Node 1: 5 connections
9. Node 9: 7 connections
10. Node 0: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we get the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <0, 6, 9>
5. <3, 4, 6>
6. <3, 4, 9>
7. <3, 4, 6>
8. <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
