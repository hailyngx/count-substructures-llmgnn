Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order and relabeling them accordingly, we get the following list: 

Vertices: 2, 7, 8, 9, 5, 6, 1, 4, 0, 3

Based on the given edges and the relabeling of vertices, we only consider the following edges that fit the criteria: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 8), (5, 7), (6, 9).

Counting the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find:
Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 3, 4>, <3, 2, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <6, 1, 9>, <7, 5, 2>
