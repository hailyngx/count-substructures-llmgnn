Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the new order is: 

Nodes: 4, 5, 3, 7, 1, 8, 9, 0, 2, 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph: 
1. Edge (0, 1) forms triangles with nodes 2, 6, 8.
2. Edge (0, 2) forms triangles with nodes 1, 6, 9.
3. Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 9.
4. Edge (0, 8) does not form any triangle as node 8 has higher connections.
5. Edge (0, 9) forms triangles with nodes 1 and 2.
6. Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with node 6.
7. Edge (1, 3) does not form any triangle as both nodes have the same degree.
8. Edge (1, 6) does not form any triangle as both nodes have the same degree.
9. Edge (2, 3) does not form any triangle as node 3 has higher connections.
10. Edge (2, 5) does not form any triangle as node 5 has higher connections.
11. Edge (2, 7) does not form any triangle as node 7 has higher connections.
12. Edge (2, 9) does not form any triangle as node 9 has higher connections.
13. Edge (3, 1) does not form any triangle as both nodes have the same degree.
14. Edge (3, 2) does not form any triangle as node 2 has higher connections.
15. Edge (4, 6) does not form any triangle as both nodes have the same degree.
16. Edge (4, 8) does not form any triangle as node 8 has higher connections.
17. Edge (5, 2) does not form any triangle as node 2 has higher connections.
18. Edge (5, 8) does not form any triangle as node 8 has higher connections.
19. Edge (6, 7) does not form any triangle as node 7 has higher connections.
20. Edge (6, 8) does not form any triangle as both nodes have the same degree.
21. Edge (6, 9) does not form any triangle as node 9 has higher connections.
22. Edge (7, 2) does not form any triangle as node 2 has higher connections.
23. Edge (7, 6) does not form any triangle as node 6 has higher connections.
24. Edge (7, 9) does not form any triangle as node 9 has higher connections.
25. Edge (8, 4) does not form any triangle as node 4 has higher connections.
26. Edge (8, 5) does not form any triangle as node 5 has higher connections.
27. Edge (8, 6) does not form any triangle as both nodes have the same degree.
28. Edge (9, 7) does not form any triangle as node 7 has higher connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 1>
