Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  
Node 4 has 0 connections  
Node 7 has 0 connections  
Node 5 has 1 connection  
Node 7 has 1 connection  
Node 0 has 3 connections  
Node 8 has 3 connections  
Node 1 has 3 connections  
Node 2 has 3 connections  
Node 6 has 3 connections  
Node 9 has 3 connections  

Now, taking the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:  
(0, 2) forms triangles with 3  
(0, 3) forms triangles with 2, 7  
(0, 7) does not form a triangle  
(1, 3) forms a triangle with 5  
(1, 5) does not form a triangle  
(1, 8) does not form a triangle  
(2, 8) does not form a triangle  
(3, 5) forms a triangle with 1  
(3, 6) does not form a triangle  
(3, 9) does not form a triangle  
(5, 6) does not form a triangle  
(5, 9) does not form a triangle  
(6, 9) does not form a triangle  

So, the total number of triangles is [3].  
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>.
