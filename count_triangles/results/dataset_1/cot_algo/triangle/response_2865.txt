Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the graph efficiently. 

The vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are: 
Node 4 (Degree 2) <
Node 5 (Degree 2) <
Node 7 (Degree 3) <
Node 9 (Degree 3) <
Node 1 (Degree 4) <
Node 0 (Degree 4) <
Node 8 (Degree 4) <
Node 3 (Degree 5) <
Node 6 (Degree 5) <
Node 2 (Degree 6)

Following the method explained earlier and going through each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the triangles formed by shared connections. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
