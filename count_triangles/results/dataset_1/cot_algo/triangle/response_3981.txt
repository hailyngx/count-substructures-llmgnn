Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first relabel the vertices based on the number of connections they have:
- Vertex 5 (Degree 0)
- Vertex 8 (Degree 0)
- Vertex 0 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 1 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 3 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 4 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 2 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 6 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 7 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 9 (Degree 5)

Now, we follow the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 6): Shared connection with vertex 9. Triangle: <0, 6, 9>
- Edge (0, 9): No shared connection.
- Edge (1, 4): No shared connection.
- Edge (1, 9): Shared connection with vertex 7. Triangle: <1, 9, 7>
- Edge (2, 6): Shared connection with vertex 7. Triangle: <2, 6, 7>
- Edge (2, 7): No shared connection.
- Edge (3, 6): No shared connection.
- Edge (3, 9): Shared connection with vertex 7. Triangle: <3, 9, 7>
- Edge (4, 1): No shared connection.
- Edge (4, 7): No shared connection.
- Edge (6, 0): Shared connection with vertex 9. Triangle: <6, 0, 9>
- Edge (6, 2): Shared connection with vertex 7. Triangle: <6, 2, 7>
- Edge (6, 3): No shared connection.
- Edge (7, 2): No shared connection.
- Edge (7, 4): No shared connection.
- Edge (7, 9): Shared connection with vertex 3. Triangle: <7, 9, 3>
- Edge (9, 0): No shared connection.
- Edge (9, 1): Shared connection with vertex 7. Triangle: <9, 1, 7>
- Edge (9, 3): Shared connection with vertex 7. Triangle: <9, 3, 7>

Count of triangles: [4]
Triangles found: <0, 6, 9>, <1, 9, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <7, 9, 3>
