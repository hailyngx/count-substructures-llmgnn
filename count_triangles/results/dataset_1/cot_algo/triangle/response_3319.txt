Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes by their number of connections:
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 9: 1 connection
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 3: 8 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 1 -> Node 0
- Node 2 -> Node 1
- Node 4 -> Node 2
- Node 5 -> Node 3
- Node 9 -> Node 4
- Node 8 -> Node 5
- Node 7 -> Node 6
- Node 6 -> Node 7
- Node 3 -> Node 8

Next, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <3, 8, 9>
- <6, 7, 8>

Count of triangles: [10]
