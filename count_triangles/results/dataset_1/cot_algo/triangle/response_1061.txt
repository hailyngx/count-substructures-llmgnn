Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. Here is the sorted list of vertices:

Vertices: 1(2), 5(2), 9(2), 0(4), 2(4), 8(4), 6(5), 4(6), 7(6), 3(8)

Following the method, we consider edges starting from the vertices with lower degrees first. These are the edges that we can use to count triangles:

(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, we will calculate the triangles formed by these edges:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 3, 7>
4. <2, 3, 4>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <8, 3, 6>

The total number of triangles is [6].
