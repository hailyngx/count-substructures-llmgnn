Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
