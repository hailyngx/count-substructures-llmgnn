Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 has 4 connections
Node 1 has 3 connections
Node 4 has 2 connections
Node 6 has 2 connections
Node 2 has 1 connections
Node 3 has 3 connections
Node 5 has 4 connections
Node 7 has 3 connections
Node 8 has 3 connections
Node 9 has 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles by examining each edge:
- Edge (0, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 3) forms the triangle <0, 2, 3>.
- Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 9) forms the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 0) forms the triangle <0, 2, 3>.
- Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 9) forms the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) forms the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
- Edge (8, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) forms the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
- Edge (9, 5) forms the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
- Edge (9, 7) forms the triangle <0, 3, 9>.

After examining all the edges, we have found 4 unique triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 9>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
