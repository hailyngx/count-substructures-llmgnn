Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:

Node 6 - 1 connection
Nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, 9 - 2 connections
Nodes 5, 8 - 3 connections
Nodes 2, 3 - 5 connections

Using degree-based ordering, we consider the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 2): Shared connection with Node 5. Triangle <0, 2, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 3): Shared connection with Node 5. Triangle <0, 3, 5>.
3. Edge (0, 6): No triangle.
4. Edge (1, 2): Shared connection with Node 5. Triangle <1, 2, 5>.
5. Edge (1, 5): No triangle.
6. Edge (1, 9): No triangle.
7. Edge (4, 8): No triangle.
8. Edge (5, 3): Shared connection with Node 2. Triangle <2, 3, 5>.
9. Edge (7, 3): No triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
