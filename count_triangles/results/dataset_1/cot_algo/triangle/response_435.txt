Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 0: 1 connections
Node 7: 1 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
  
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. (0, 8): Does not form a triangle.
2. (1, 4): Does not form a triangle.
3. (1, 6): Does not form a triangle.
4. (1, 8): Forms triangle with node 0: <0, 1, 8>.
5. (2, 3): Does not form a triangle.
6. (2, 6): Does not form a triangle.
7. (2, 8): Forms triangle with node 1: <1, 2, 8>.
8. (2, 9): Does not form a triangle.
9. (3, 2): Does not form a triangle.
10. (3, 4): Does not form a triangle.
11. (3, 9): Does not form a triangle.
12. (4, 1): Does not form a triangle.
13. (4, 3): Does not form a triangle.
14. (4, 5): Does not form a triangle.
15. (4, 6): Does not form a triangle.
16. (4, 9): Does not form a triangle.
17. (5, 4): Does not form a triangle.
18. (5, 6): Does not form a triangle.
19. (6, 1): Does not form a triangle.
20. (6, 2): Does not form a triangle.
21. (6, 4): Does not form a triangle.
22. (6, 5): Does not form a triangle.
23. (6, 8): Does not form a triangle.
24. (7, 9): Does not form a triangle.
25. (8, 0): Does not form a triangle.
26. (8, 1): Does not form a triangle.
27. (8, 2): Does not form a triangle.
28. (8, 6): Forms triangle with node 1: <1, 6, 8>.
29. (8, 9): Forms triangle with node 2: <2, 8, 9>.
30. (9, 2): Does not form a triangle.
31. (9, 3): Does not form a triangle.
32. (9, 4): Does not form a triangle.
33. (9, 7): Does not form a triangle.
34. (9, 8): Does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 8, 9>.
