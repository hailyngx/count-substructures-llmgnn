Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree, starting from the node with the least connections to the one with the most connections:

Node 0 (2 connections) becomes Node 0
Node 4 (2 connections) becomes Node 1
Node 7 (3 connections) becomes Node 2
Node 1 (3 connections) becomes Node 3
Node 6 (3 connections) becomes Node 4
Node 9 (4 connections) becomes Node 5
Node 5 (4 connections) becomes Node 6
Node 8 (4 connections) becomes Node 7
Node 2 (5 connections) becomes Node 8
Node 3 (5 connections) becomes Node 9

Now, let's identify the triangles formed by looking at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles: 
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles, we find:
