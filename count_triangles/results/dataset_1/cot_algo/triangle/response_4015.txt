Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2

Following the degree-based ordering, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 0), (4, 0), (9, 0), (6, 0), (4, 1), (9, 8), (8, 5), (7, 5), (2, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6), (3, 2), (7, 2)

After examining the edges and counting the triangles formed by shared connections, we find that there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 5>
<8, 9, 0>
