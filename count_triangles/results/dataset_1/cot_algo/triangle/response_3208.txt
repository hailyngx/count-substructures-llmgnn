Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: Degree = 2
- Node 1: Degree = 1
- Node 3: Degree = 5
- Node 4: Degree = 5
- Node 5: Degree = 2
- Node 6: Degree = 3
- Node 8: Degree = 2
- Node 9: Degree = 1

Next, we sort the nodes by degree, and assign new labels accordingly:
- Node 1 -> Node 0 (Degree = 1)
- Node 9 -> Node 1 (Degree = 1)
- Node 0 -> Node 2 (Degree = 2)
- Node 5 -> Node 3 (Degree = 2)
- Node 8 -> Node 4 (Degree = 2)
- Node 6 -> Node 5 (Degree = 3)
- Node 3 -> Node 6 (Degree = 5)
- Node 4 -> Node 7 (Degree = 5)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <2, 3, 4>
2. <2, 5, 6>
3. <3, 4, 7>
4. <3, 6, 5>
5. <3, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [5]
