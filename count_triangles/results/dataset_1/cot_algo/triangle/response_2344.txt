Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertex 0 has 3 connections
Vertex 1 has 4 connections
Vertex 8 has 1 connection
Vertex 4 has 1 connection
Vertex 3 has 2 connections
Vertex 7 has 3 connections
Vertex 6 has 3 connections
Vertex 2 has 3 connections
Vertex 5 has 4 connections
Vertex 9 has 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
Vertex 8 (degree: 1) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 4 (degree: 1) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 3 (degree: 2) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 7 (degree: 3) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 6 (degree: 3) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 2 (degree: 3) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 5 (degree: 4) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 0 (degree: 3) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 1 (degree: 4) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 9 (degree: 4) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will count the triangles based on the edges:
1. Edge between Vertex 0 and Vertex 1:
   Both have 1 common neighbor - Vertex 4
   Therefore, triangle: <0, 1, 4>

2. Edge between Vertex 0 and Vertex 6:
   Both have 1 common neighbor - Vertex 5
   Therefore, triangle: <0, 6, 5>

3. Edge between Vertex 0 and Vertex 9:
   Both have 1 common neighbor - Vertex 7
   Therefore, triangle: <0, 9, 7>

4. Edge between Vertex 1 and Vertex 2:
   Both have 1 common neighbor - Vertex 3
   Therefore, triangle: <1, 2, 3>

5. Edge between Vertex 1 and Vertex 5:
   Both have 1 common neighbor - Vertex 6
   Therefore, triangle: <1, 5, 6>

6. Edge between Vertex 1 and Vertex 7:
   Both have 1 common neighbor - Vertex 3
   Therefore, triangle: <1, 7, 3>

7. Edge between Vertex 2 and Vertex 6:
   Both have 1 common neighbor - Vertex 5
   Therefore, triangle: <2, 6, 5>

8. Edge between Vertex 5 and Vertex 7:
   Both have 1 common neighbor - Vertex 3
   Therefore, triangle: <5, 7, 3>

9. Edge between Vertex 5 and Vertex 9:
   Both have 1 common neighbor - Vertex 6
   Therefore, triangle: <5, 9, 6>

10. Edge between Vertex 6 and Vertex 9:
   Both have 1 common neighbor - Vertex 5
   Therefore, triangle: <6, 9, 5>

There are 10 triangles in this graph.
Thus, the total number of triangles is [10].
