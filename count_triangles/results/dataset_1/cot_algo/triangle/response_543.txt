Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their degree are: 1, 8, 2, 5, 6, 3, 7, 0, 4, 9.

Now, we identify and count the triangles:

Triangles:
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [2]
