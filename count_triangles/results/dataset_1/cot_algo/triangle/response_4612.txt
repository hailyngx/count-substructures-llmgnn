Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method begins with sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Node 7, 2 connections
Node 2, 2 connections
Node 3, 2 connections
Node 5, 3 connections
Node 8, 3 connections
Node 0, 4 connections
Node 1, 4 connections
Node 6, 4 connections
Node 4, 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes from 0 to 9 based on their degrees:

Node 7 -> 0
Node 2 -> 1
Node 3 -> 2
Node 5 -> 3
Node 8 -> 4
Node 0 -> 5
Node 1 -> 6
Node 6 -> 7
Node 4 -> 8

Using the relabeled vertices, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Then, we check for shared connections between the two vertices to count triangles.

Now, let's count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 0, 4>
<2, 5, 3>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 4>
