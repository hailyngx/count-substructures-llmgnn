Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections/degree in ascending order. Then, the vertices are re-labeled starting from 0.

After relabeling the vertices, the new graph representation becomes:
- Vertex 0: connections with vertices 2, 3, 6
- Vertex 1: connections with vertices 2, 4
- Vertex 2: connections with vertices 0, 1, 6, 7
- Vertex 3: connections with vertex 0
- Vertex 4: connections with vertices 1, 6, 7
- Vertex 5: connections with vertices 6, 8
- Vertex 6: connections with vertices 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Vertex 7: connections with vertices 2, 4
- Vertex 8: connections with vertex 5
- Vertex 9: connections with vertex 6

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering lower labeled vertices with fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle: <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle: <2, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
