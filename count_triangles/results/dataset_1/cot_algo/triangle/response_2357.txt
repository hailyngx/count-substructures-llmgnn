Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the nodes by their degree:

0: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
4: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 1 connection
5: 1 connection
6: 1 connection
7: 1 connection

Now we can start counting the triangles:

- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 8)
- Triangle 2: (0, 1, 9)
- Triangle 3: (1, 2, 8)
- Triangle 4: (1, 9, 8)

Output: [4] 
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 9, 8>
