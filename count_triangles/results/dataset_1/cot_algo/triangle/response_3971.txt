Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices: 0, 2, 7, 4, 5, 9, 3, 6, 1, 8

Now, counting the triangles:
- Edge (0, 8): Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 3): Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 5): Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 8): Shared connections: 0
- Edge (1, 9): Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 4): Shared connections: None
- Edge (3, 1): Not processed as vertex 1 has more connections
- Edge (4, 2): Shared connections: None
- Edge (5, 1): Not processed as vertex 1 has more connections
- Edge (7, 8): Shared connections: None
- Edge (8, 0): Not processed as vertex 8 has more connections
- Edge (8, 1): Not processed as vertex 8 has more connections
- Edge (8, 7): Shared connections: None
- Edge (9, 1): Not processed as vertex 9 has more connections

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 8>
