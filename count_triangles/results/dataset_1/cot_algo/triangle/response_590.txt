Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:  

- Vertex 1 (degree 2)
- Vertex 3 (degree 2)
- Vertex 0 (degree 2)
- Vertex 5 (degree 2)
- Vertex 6 (degree 2)
- Vertex 7 (degree 2)
- Vertex 4 (degree 3)
- Vertex 9 (degree 3)
- Vertex 8 (degree 5)
- Vertex 2 (not connected to any edge)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

Triangles found in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 9>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 8, 5>
- <4, 9, 7>
- <4, 9, 8>
- <5, 8, 6>
- <7, 6, 8>
- <7, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
