Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 7 has 2 connection(s).
- Node 0 has 2 connection(s).
- Node 9 has 2 connection(s).
- Node 6 has 3 connection(s).
- Node 1 has 3 connection(s).
- Node 4 has 3 connection(s).
- Node 8 has 3 connection(s).
- Node 2 has 4 connection(s).
- Node 5 has 5 connection(s).
- Node 3 has 5 connection(s).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Checking (0, 6): Shared connections with node 0 and node 6 are {8}. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 8>.
- Checking (0, 8): No triangle formed.
- Checking (1, 3): Shared connections with node 1 and node 3 are {}. No triangle formed.
- Checking (1, 4): Shared connections with node 1 and node 4 are {}. No triangle formed.
- Checking (1, 6): Shared connections with node 1 and node 6 are {0}. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 0>.
- Checking (2, 4): No triangle formed.
- Checking (2, 5): No triangle formed.
- Checking (2, 7): No triangle formed.
- Checking (3, 1): Shared connections with node 3 and node 1 are {}. No triangle formed.
- Checking (3, 5): Shared connections with node 3 and node 5 are {}. No triangle formed.
- Checking (3, 8): No triangle formed.
- Checking (3, 9): No triangle formed.
- Checking (4, 1): Shared connections with node 4 and node 1 are {}. No triangle formed.
- Checking (4, 2): No triangle formed.
- Checking (4, 6): Shared connections with node 4 and node 6 are {0}. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 0>.
- Checking (5, 2): No triangle formed.
- Checking (5, 3): Shared connections with node 5 and node 3 are {}. No triangle formed.
- Checking (5, 7): No triangle formed.
- Checking (5, 8): No triangle formed.
- Checking (5, 9): No triangle formed.
- Checking (6, 0): No triangle formed.
- Checking (6, 1): Shared connections with node 6 and node 1 are {0}. Triangle formed: <6, 1, 0>.
- Checking (6, 4): No triangle formed.
- Checking (7, 2): No triangle formed.
- Checking (7, 5): No triangle formed.
- Checking (8, 0): No triangle formed.
- Checking (8, 3): No triangle formed.
- Checking (8, 5): No triangle formed.
- Checking (9, 3): No triangle formed.
- Checking (9, 5): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [3]
