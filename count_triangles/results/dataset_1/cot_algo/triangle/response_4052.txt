Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4

Sorted by degree:
Node 7 < Node 0 = Node 2 = Node 6 = Node 8 < Node 9 < Node 1 = Node 3 = Node 4 < Node 5

Using the edge list and the degree-based ordering, we can count the number of triangles:

Triangles:
1. <1, 4, 6>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <1, 5, 8>
4. <3, 4, 6>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <3, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
