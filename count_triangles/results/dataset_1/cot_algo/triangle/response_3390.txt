Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
1. 1 (degree: 1)
2. 3 (degree: 1)
3. 8 (degree: 1)
4. 0 (degree: 3)
5. 4 (degree: 3)
6. 7 (degree: 3)
7. 6 (degree: 4)
8. 5 (degree: 4)
9. 9 (degree: 5)
10. 2 (degree: 5)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>
- [5 triangles in total]
