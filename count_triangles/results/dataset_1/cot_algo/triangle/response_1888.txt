Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes as follows:
Node 0 (Degree 2) -> Node 0
Node 3 (Degree 2) -> Node 1
Node 6 (Degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 8 (Degree 2) -> Node 3
Node 5 (Degree 3) -> Node 4
Node 1 (Degree 3) -> Node 5
Node 7 (Degree 4) -> Node 6
Node 4 (Degree 4) -> Node 7
Node 9 (Degree 4) -> Node 8
Node 2 (Degree 5) -> Node 9

With the relabeled vertices, we can now check for triangles based on the connections:

- For the edge (0, 6), proceed since Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 2 and they are connected through Node 9, forming the triangle <0, 6, 9>.
- For the edge (0, 9), proceed since Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 8 and they are connected through Node 2, forming the triangle <0, 6, 9>.
- For the edge (1, 2), proceed since Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 9 and they are connected through Node 7, forming the triangle <1, 7, 2>.
- For the edge (1, 7), proceed since Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 6 and they are connected through Node 2, forming the triangle <1, 7, 2>.
- For the edge (1, 8), proceed since Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 3 and they are connected through Node 9, forming the triangle <1, 2, 9>.
- For the edge (2, 4), proceed since Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 7 and they are connected through Node 5, forming the triangle <4, 2, 5>.
- For the edge (2, 5), proceed since Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 5 and they are connected through Node 7, forming the triangle <2, 5, 7>.
- For the edge (2, 7), proceed since Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 6 and they are connected through Node 1, forming the triangle <2, 7, 1>.
- For the edge (2, 9), proceed since Node 9 has fewer connections than Node 8 and they are connected through Node 0, forming the triangle <2, 0, 9>.
- For the edge (3, 4), proceed since Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 7 and they are connected through Node 5, forming the triangle <3, 4, 5>.
- For the edge (4, 5), proceed since Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 6 and they are connected through Node 2, forming the triangle <4, 5, 2>.
- For the edge (4, 9), proceed since Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 8 and they are connected through Node 2, forming the triangle <9, 4, 2>.
