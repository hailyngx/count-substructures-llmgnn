Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 3 has 0 connections.
Node 8 has 1 connection.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 5 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.
Node 4 has 7 connections.

Using the lower labeled vertex rule, we will now check for triangles formed by shared connections:
- Triangle <1, 9, 7>
- Triangle <4, 6, 5>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
