Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections.

The sorted vertices are: 
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections

Now, we will count the triangles by checking the shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

Based on the given edges, the triangles found are:
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 8, 1>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 3, 7>
<7, 4, 9>
<9, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
