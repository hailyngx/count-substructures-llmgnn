Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new numbering will be:
Node 7 (Degree 1)
Node 0 (Degree 2)
Node 6 (Degree 2)
Node 9 (Degree 2)
Node 5 (Degree 3)
Node 2 (Degree 3)
Node 4 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 5)
Node 8 (Degree 6)
Node 3 (Degree 6)
