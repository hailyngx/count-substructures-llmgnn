Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Degrees:
0: 2
1: 2
2: 2
3: 2
5: 3
8: 2
9: 3

Vertex ordering:
0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 5, 9

Now, we will analyze the edges in the order specified:

(0, 1): Both vertices have degree 2, we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 9.
(0, 3): Both vertices have degree 2, we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 8.

(1, 9): Both vertices have degree 2, we proceed. They share a connection with vertices 0 and 2.

(2, 5): Both vertices have degree 2, we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 9.

(3, 8): Both vertices have degree 2, we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 0 and 5.

(5, 9): Vertex 5 has degree 3, so we skip this edge.

Calculating the total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 9, 2>
