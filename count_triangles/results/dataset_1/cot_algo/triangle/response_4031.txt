Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is: 
Nodes: 1(2), 0(3), 5(3), 7(3), 3(4), 6(4), 4(5), 9(5), 8(6), 2(6) 

Now, we can count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

There are 10 triangles in total: 
[10]

The unique triangles found are: 
<2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 8>
