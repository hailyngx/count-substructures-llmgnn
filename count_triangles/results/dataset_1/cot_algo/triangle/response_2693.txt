Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new vertex labels are as follows:
- Node 0 has 1 connection
- Node 5 has 1 connection
- Node 8 has 1 connection
- Node 6 has 3 connections
- Node 2 has 3 connections
- Node 7 has 3 connections
- Node 1 has 4 connections
- Node 9 has 5 connections
- Node 4 has 6 connections
- Node 3 has 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
