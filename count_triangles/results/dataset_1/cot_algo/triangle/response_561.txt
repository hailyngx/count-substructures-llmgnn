Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree and relabeling them accordingly, the new vertex ordering is: 0, 1, 5, 7, 3, 4, 2, 8, 6, 9.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles: 
- Edge (0, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle <1, 3, 9>.
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4) forms a triangle <2, 4, 9>.
- Edge (2, 6) forms a triangle <2, 6, 8>.
- Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle <2, 6, 8>.
- Edge (3, 1) forms a triangle <1, 3, 9>.
- Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle <1, 3, 9>.
- Edge (4, 2) forms a triangle <2, 4, 9>.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle <2, 4, 9>.
- Edge (5, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 2) forms a triangle <2, 6, 8>.
- Edge (6, 8) forms a triangle <2, 6, 8>.
- Edge (6, 9) forms a triangle <6, 8, 9>.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 2) forms a triangle <2, 6, 8>.
- Edge (8, 6) forms a triangle <2, 6, 8>.
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) forms a triangle <1, 3, 9>.
- Edge (9, 4) forms a triangle <2, 4, 9>.
- Edge (9, 6) forms a triangle <6, 8, 9>.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [11], and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, and <6, 8, 9>.
