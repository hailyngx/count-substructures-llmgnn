Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degrees for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 2

Now, we sort the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 5, Node 8, Node 2, Node 4, Node 9, Node 3, Node 7, Node 6, Node 0

After relabeling the nodes accordingly, the new list of edges becomes:
(5, 9) (8, 0) (2, 0) (4, 0) (9, 6) (3, 0) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (0, 2) (3, 6) (6, 7) (7, 3) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 6) (9, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (6, 3) (4, 6) (0, 8)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
