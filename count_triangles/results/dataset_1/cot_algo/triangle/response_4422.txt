Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:
Vertex 0: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 1
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 1
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 8: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 4

Relabel the vertices:
Vertex 0 -> 2
Vertex 1 -> 4
Vertex 2 -> 1
Vertex 3 -> 3
Vertex 4 -> 5
Vertex 5 -> 6
Vertex 6 -> 8
Vertex 7 -> 7
Vertex 8 -> 9
Vertex 9 -> 10

Now, let's count the triangles:
Based on the sorted vertices and degrees, we proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <0, 8, 5>
- Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <1, 5, 3>
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.

Count of triangles inside brackets: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 5, 3>
