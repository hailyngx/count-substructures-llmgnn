Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows after sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes: 3, 1, 8, 9, 5, 2, 7, 6, 4, 0

Edges to consider:
- (3, 1)
- (1, 8)
- (8, 9)
- (9, 5)
- (5, 2)
- (2, 7)
- (7, 6)
- (6, 4)
- (4, 0)

Count of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<1, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
