Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 1: 1 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 2: 7 connections

Identifying triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle <3, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
