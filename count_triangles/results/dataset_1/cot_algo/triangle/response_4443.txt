Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, we get the following list:  
Vertex 0 -> Degree 2  
Vertex 1 -> Degree 3  
Vertex 5 -> Degree 2  
Vertex 8 -> Degree 2  
Vertex 4 -> Degree 2  
Vertex 6 -> Degree 4  
Vertex 2 -> Degree 3  
Vertex 7 -> Degree 4  
Vertex 3 -> Degree 3  

Following the degree-based ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:

<0, 6, 3>  
<0, 6, 7>  
<0, 6, 7>  
<0, 6, 7>  
<1, 3, 4>  
<1, 3, 6>  
<1, 3, 6>  
<1, 8, 7>  
<2, 1, 3>  
<2, 1, 3>  
<2, 4, 3>  
<2, 5, 7>  
<2, 5, 7>  
<4, 3, 6>  
<5, 2, 1>  
<5, 2, 7>  
<6, 0, 7>  
<6, 3, 7>  
<6, 7, 8>  
<7, 0, 5>  
<7, 0, 6>  
<7, 0, 6>  
<7, 5, 2>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 23, and the unique triangles found are <0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 8, 7>, <2, 1, 3>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 3, 6>, <5, 2, 1>, <5, 2, 7>, <6, 0, 7>, <6, 3, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 0, 5>.
