Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 2: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through each edge and check for shared connections to count the triangles.

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 4, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
