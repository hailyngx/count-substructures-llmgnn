Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, we get the following list:  

Node 3: 0 connections  
Node 4: 1 connection  
Node 6: 1 connection  
Node 0: 2 connections  
Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 7: 3 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 5: 5 connections  
Node 8: 7 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges with the lower labeled node having fewer connections:  
1. (0, 1) - Shared connections: none  
2. (0, 5) - Shared connections: 5  
3. (1, 2) - Shared connections: none  
4. (1, 6) - Shared connections: none  
5. (1, 8) - Shared connections: none  
6. (2, 8) - Shared connections: none  
7. (3, 5) - Shared connections: none  
8. (4, 7) - Shared connections: none  
9. (5, 7) - Shared connections: none  
10. (5, 8) - Shared connections: 8  
11. (6, 8) - Shared connections: none  
12. (7, 8) - Shared connections: none  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 5, 8>  
<1, 8, 5>  
<5, 7, 8>
