Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the steps of the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The sorted list of vertices based on their number of connections is: 
0 (degree 3)
2 (degree 1)
5 (degree 2)
7 (degree 4)
9 (degree 5)
1 (degree 6)
6 (degree 5)
4 (degree 5)
8 (degree 5)
3 (degree 6)

Using the given edges, we will now count the number of triangles:

In this case, we proceed with the edges involving vertices with lower labels:
(0, 1): Forms triangles <0, 1, 3> and <0, 1, 4>.
(0, 7): No triangles.
(0, 9): No triangles.
(1, 3): Forms triangle <1, 3, 4>.
(1, 4): Forms triangle <1, 4, 6>.
(1, 5): No triangles.
(1, 8): No triangles.
(2, 3): No triangles.
(3, 6): Form triangle <3, 6, 4>.
(3, 7): Forms triangle <3, 7, 6>.
(3, 8): No triangles.
(3, 9): Forms triangle <3, 9, 4>.
(4, 6): No triangles.
(4, 7): Forms triangle <4, 7, 6>.
(4, 8): Forms triangle <4, 8, 6>.
(4, 9): No triangles.
(5, 6): No triangles.
(5, 9): No triangles.
(6, 7): No triangles.
(6, 8): Forms triangle <6, 8, 4>.
(7, 8): No triangles.
(7, 9): No triangles.
(8, 9): Forms triangle <8, 9, 4>.

The total number of triangles is [9] inside brackets. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 7, 6>, <3, 9, 4>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 8, 6>, <8, 9, 4>.
