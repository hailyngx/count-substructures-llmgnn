Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly and count the number of triangles using the rules mentioned earlier.

The sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections is: 
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:
- (0, 3) forms a triangle with (3, 7): <0, 3, 7>
- (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
- (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
- (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
- (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
- (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
- (3, 0) forms a triangle with (0, 7): <0, 3, 7>
- (3, 1) does not form a triangle.
- (3, 5) does not form a triangle.
- (3, 7) does not form a triangle.
- (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
- (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
- (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
- (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
- (5, 3) does not form a triangle.
- (5, 4) does not form a triangle.
- (6, 1) does not form a triangle.
- (6, 2) does not form a triangle.
- (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
- (7, 0) forms a triangle with (0, 3): <0, 3, 7>
- (7, 3) does not form a triangle.
- (7, 4) does not form a triangle.
- (8, 3) does not form a triangle.
- (8, 6) does not form a triangle.
- (9, 1) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
