Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree:
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 1, 3, 9: 2 connections
Node 2, 7: 3 connections
Node 0, 8: 4 connections
Node 4, 5, 6: 5 connections
