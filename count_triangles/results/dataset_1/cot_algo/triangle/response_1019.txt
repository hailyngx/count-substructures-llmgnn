Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new numbering for the vertices is as follows:
  
Node 1 -> 3 connections
Node 3 -> 2 connections
Node 6 -> 1 connection
Node 9 -> 2 connections
Node 5 -> 2 connections
Node 4 -> 1 connection
Node 7 -> 4 connections
Node 2 -> 5 connections
Node 8 -> 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges based on the new numbering:

1. Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1(3) has fewer connections than Vertex 2(5). Looking for shared connections, we find Vertex 4 connected to both vertices. Therefore, we identify triangle <1, 2, 4>.
2. Edge (1, 4): Both vertices have only one connection, so no triangle is formed.
3. Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2(5) has fewer connections than Vertex 7(4). Looking for shared connections, we find Vertex 8 connected to both vertices. Therefore, we identify triangle <2, 7, 8>.
4. Edge (2, 8): Vertex 2(5) has fewer connections than Vertex 8(6). Looking for shared connections, we find Vertex 7 connected to both vertices. Therefore, we identify triangle <2, 8, 7>.
5. Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3(2) has fewer connections than Vertex 5(2). Looking for shared connections, we find no triangle is formed.
6. Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3(2) has fewer connections than Vertex 8(6). Looking for shared connections, we find no triangle is formed.
7. Edge (3, 9): Both vertices have two connections, so no triangle is formed.
8. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5(2) has fewer connections than Vertex 7(4). Looking for shared connections, we find no triangle is formed.
9. Edge (6, 8): Vertex 6(1) has fewer connections than Vertex 8(6). Looking for shared connections, we find no triangle is formed.
10. Edge (7, 8): Vertex 7(4) has fewer connections than Vertex 8(6). Looking for shared connections, we find no triangle is formed.
11. Edge (8, 9): Vertex 8(6) has fewer connections than Vertex 9(2). Looking for shared connections, we find no triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 4> and <2, 7, 8>.
