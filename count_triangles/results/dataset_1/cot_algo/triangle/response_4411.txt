Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes by degree:
0: 2 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 1 connection

Relabeling the vertices based on their degree:
0 (2 connections) -> 0
3 (2 connections) -> 1
4 (2 connections) -> 2
7 (2 connections) -> 3
9 (1 connection) -> 4
2 (3 connections) -> 5
5 (3 connections) -> 6
6 (4 connections) -> 7
1 (4 connections) -> 8
8 (4 connections) -> 9

Now, we will examine all the edges in the graph based on the relabeled vertices:

Triangles found:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
