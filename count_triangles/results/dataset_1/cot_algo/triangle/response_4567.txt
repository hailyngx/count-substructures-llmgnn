Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are: 

Node 0 has 1 connection.
Node 3 has 1 connection.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 8 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 7 connections.
Node 9 has 7 connections.

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

For edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 share one common connection, so there is 1 triangle.
For edge (1, 4): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (1, 5): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (1, 7): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (2, 0): Node 0 and Node 2 share one common connection, so there is 1 triangle.
For edge (2, 3): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (2, 7): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (2, 8): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (2, 9): Node 2, Node 9, and Node 7 form a triangle <2, 7, 9>.
For edge (3, 2): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (3, 9): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (4, 1): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (4, 5): Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 form a triangle <4, 5, 9>.
For edge (4, 6): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (4, 9): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (5, 1): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (5, 4): Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 form a triangle <4, 5, 9>.
For edge (5, 9): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (6, 4): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (7, 1): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (7, 2): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (7, 9): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (8, 2): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (9, 2): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (9, 3): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (9, 4): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (9, 5): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.
For edge (9, 7): No triangles are formed due to the ordering.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <2, 7, 9> and <4, 5, 9>.
