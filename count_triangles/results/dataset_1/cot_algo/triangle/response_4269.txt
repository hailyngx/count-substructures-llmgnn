Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new vertex labels will be as follows:
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 5 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

1. Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
   - Edge (1, 0): Node 1 (2 connections) < Node 0 (4 connections)
   - Shared connections between Node 1 and Node 0: None

2. Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
   - Edge (2, 3): Node 2 (2 connections) < Node 3 (4 connections)
   - Shared connections between Node 2 and Node 3: None

3. Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
   - Edge (5, 4): Node 5 (3 connections) < Node 4 (3 connections)
   - Shared connections between Node 5 and Node 4: Node 6
   - Triangle <5, 4, 6> found.

4. Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
   - Edge (2, 7): Node 2 (2 connections) < Node 7 (5 connections)
   - Shared connections between Node 2 and Node 7: None

5. Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
   - Edge (7, 1): Node 7 (5 connections) > Node 1 (2 connections)

6. Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
   - Edge (0, 1): Node 0 (4 connections) > Node 1 (2 connections)

7. Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
   - Edge (6, 7): Node 6 (4 connections) < Node 7 (5 connections)
   - Shared connections between Node 6 and Node 7: Node 3
   - Triangle <6, 7, 3> found.

8. Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
   - Edge (4, 6): Node 4 (3 connections) < Node 6 (4 connections)
   - Shared connections between Node 4 and Node 6: None

9. Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
   - Edge (3, 6): Node 3 (4 connections) < Node 6 (4 connections)
   - Shared connections between Node 3 and Node 6: None

10. Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
    - Edge (7, 2): Node 7 (5 connections) > Node 2 (2 connections)

11. Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
    - Edge (8, 0): Node 8 (3 connections) < Node 0 (4 connections)
    - Shared connections between Node 8 and Node 0: None

12. Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
    - Edge (8, 3): Node 8 (3 connections) < Node 3 (4 connections)
