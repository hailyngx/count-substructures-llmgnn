Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Node 0 -> 4 connections
Node 2 -> 1 connection
Node 7 -> 1 connection
Node 3 -> 4 connections
Node 6 -> 2 connections
Node 8 -> 4 connections
Node 9 -> 4 connections
Node 1 -> 6 connections
Node 5 -> 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order: (2, 8), (7, 0), (7, 0), (9, 6), (9, 6), (8, 2), (6, 1), (6, 1), (8, 1), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 5), (8, 5), (5, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 3), (5, 9), (5, 9), (5, 9), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5).

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<8, 1, 6>
<8, 1, 5>
<8, 1, 9>
<8, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
