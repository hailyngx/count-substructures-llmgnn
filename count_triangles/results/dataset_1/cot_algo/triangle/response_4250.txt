Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Vertex 0 has 4 connections  
Vertex 3 has 4 connections  
Vertex 7 has 4 connections  
Vertex 2 has 5 connections  
Vertex 4 has 5 connections  
Vertex 5 has 5 connections  
Vertex 6 has 5 connections  
Vertex 8 has 6 connections  
Vertex 1 has 9 connections  
Vertex 9 has 5 connections  

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Calculating the number of triangles inside brackets []: [18]

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 5>  
<0, 1, 6>  
<0, 1, 8>  
<0, 5, 6>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<0, 6, 8>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<3, 7, 8>  
<4, 5, 6>  
<4, 5, 8>  
<4, 6, 8>  
<1, 4, 5>  
<1, 4, 6>  
<1, 4, 8>  
<1, 5, 6>  
<1, 5, 8>  
<1, 6, 8>  
<6, 7, 9>
