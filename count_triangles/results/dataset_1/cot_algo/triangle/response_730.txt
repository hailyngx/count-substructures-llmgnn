Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method aims to count the number of triangles in a graph. Let's go ahead and apply this method to the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   - Vertex 4: 0 connections
   - Vertices 0, 3, and 5: 1 connection
   - Vertices 2 and 9: 2 connections
   - Vertices 1, 8, and 7: 4 connections
   - Vertex 6: 5 connections

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Vertex 0 → 0
   - Vertex 1 → 1
   - Vertex 2 → 2
   - Vertex 3 → 3
   - Vertex 4 → 4
   - Vertex 5 → 5
   - Vertex 6 → 6
   - Vertex 7 → 7
   - Vertex 8 → 8
   - Vertex 9 → 9

3. Analyze each edge based on the above relabeling:
   - (0, 1): Vertex 0 has 1 connection, Vertex 1 has 4 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: 1 (with Vertex 6)
   - (0, 6): Vertex 0 has 1 connection, Vertex 6 has 5 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: None
   - (0, 9): Vertex 0 has 1 connection, Vertex 9 has 2 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: None
   - (1, 2): Vertex 1 has 4 connections, Vertex 2 has 2 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: 1 (with Vertex 7)
   - (1, 3): Vertex 1 has 4 connections, Vertex 3 has 1 connection, proceed.
     - Shared connections: None
   - (1, 7): Vertex 1 has 4 connections, Vertex 7 has 4 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: 1 (with Vertex 2)
   - (2, 7): Vertex 2 has 2 connections, Vertex 7 has 4 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: 1 (with Vertex 1)
   - (2, 9): Vertex 2 has 2 connections, Vertex 9 has 2 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: None
   - (3, 8): Vertex 3 has 1 connection, Vertex 8 has 4 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: None
   - (5, 6): Vertex 5 has 1 connection, Vertex 6 has 5 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: None
   - (5, 7): Vertex 5 has 1 connection, Vertex 7 has 4 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: None
   - (5, 8): Vertex 5 has 1 connection, Vertex 8 has 4 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: None
   - (6, 8): Vertex 6 has 5 connections, Vertex 8 has 4 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: None
   - (6, 9): Vertex 6 has 5 connections, Vertex 9 has 2 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: None
   - (7, 8): Vertex 7 has 4 connections, Vertex 8 has 4 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: None
   - (7, 9): Vertex 7 has 4 connections, Vertex 9 has 2 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: None
   - (8, 9): Vertex 8 has 4 connections, Vertex 9 has 2 connections, proceed.
     - Shared connections: None

4. Count the total number of triangles:
   - Number of triangles: 2

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 7> and <0, 1, 6>.
