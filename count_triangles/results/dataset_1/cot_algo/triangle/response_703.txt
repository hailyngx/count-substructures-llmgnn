Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
  
Node 0 -> Degree 3
Node 4 -> Degree 4
Node 5 -> Degree 2
Node 7 -> Degree 2
Node 8 -> Degree 1
Node 2 -> Degree 3
Node 6 -> Degree 5
Node 1 -> Degree 3
Node 9 -> Degree 5
Node 3 -> Degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order: (8, 7), (7, 5), (5, 2), (2, 6), (6, 1), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 9), (0, 9), (0, 3), (3, 9), (3, 6), (6, 4).

By examining the shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<6, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
