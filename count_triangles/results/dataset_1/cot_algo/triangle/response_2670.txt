Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree:
Node 4: 0 connections
Node 9: 0 connections
Node 2: 1 connection (Node 5)
Node 8: 1 connection (Node 1)
Node 6: 2 connections (Nodes 0, 2)
Node 3: 3 connections (Nodes 5, 6, 7)
Node 1: 3 connections (Nodes 0, 7, 8)
Node 5: 3 connections (Nodes 2, 3, 7)
Node 0: 5 connections (Nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, 9)
Node 7: 5 connections (Nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 5)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we find the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 3, 7>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
