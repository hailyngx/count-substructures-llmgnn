Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling is:
0 (degree 3)
7 (degree 1)
4 (degree 2)
2 (degree 3)
8 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)
1 (degree 4)
5 (degree 4)
9 (degree 4)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- For edge (0, 1): Both vertices have fewer connections than the other, so proceed.
  Shared connections: 5, 9
- For edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 has fewer connections, proceed.
  Shared connections: 1, 2
- For edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has fewer connections, proceed.
  Shared connections: 3
- For edge (1, 2): Both have fewer connections, proceed.
  Shared connections: 3
- For edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 has fewer connections, proceed.
  Shared connections: 2
- For edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 has fewer connections, proceed.
  Shared connections: 8
- For edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has fewer connections, proceed.
  Shared connections: 4
- For edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 has fewer connections, proceed.
  Shared connections: 1
- For edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 has fewer connections, proceed.
  Shared connections: None

The total number of triangles is [9] and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <5, 8, 9>.
