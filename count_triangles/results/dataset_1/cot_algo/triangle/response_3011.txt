Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes sorted by their number of connections:
0 (degree 1)
2 (degree 1)
5 (degree 1)
7 (degree 1)
3 (degree 0)
1 (degree 2)
9 (degree 2)
6 (degree 2)
8 (degree 4)
4 (degree 6)

Triangles found:
[5]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1]. 
Unique triangles found: <5, 8, 4>.
