Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
- Vertex 2: degree 2 
- Vertex 3: degree 2 
- Vertex 7: degree 2 
- Vertex 8: degree 3 
- Vertex 9: degree 3 
- Vertex 5: degree 4 
- Vertex 1: degree 4 
- Vertex 3: degree 4 
- Vertex 0: degree 4 
- Vertex 6: degree 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, the edges to consider are: (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 2), (7, 2), (8, 0), (9, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9), (4, 0), (4, 2), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 1), (7, 5), (9, 5).

The total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>.
