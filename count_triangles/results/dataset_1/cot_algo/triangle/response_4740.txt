Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows: 

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 1
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 6
Node 2: Degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the triangles:

- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 4: <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle 5: <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle 6: <6, 7, 8>
- Triangle 7: <6, 8, 9>
- Triangle 8: <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
