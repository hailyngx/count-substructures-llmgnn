Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph, we get the following sorted vertices based on the number of connections:

Vertices:  
1. Node 7 (0 connections)
2. Node 5 (1 connection)
3. Node 7 (1 connection)
4. Node 2 (2 connections)
5. Node 3 (3 connections)
6. Node 1 (4 connections)
7. Node 0 (7 connections)
8. Node 4 (9 connections)
9. Node 8 (9 connections)
10. Node 6 (9 connections)

There are total [13] triangles in the graph, and they are as follows:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
