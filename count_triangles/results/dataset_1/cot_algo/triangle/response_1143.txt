Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph sorted by vertex connections:

Node 4: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 5: 6 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 already have 3 and 6 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
2. Edge (0, 8): Nodes 0 and 8 already have 3 and 5 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
3. Edge (1, 3): Nodes 1 and 3 already have 3 and 4 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
4. Edge (1, 5): Nodes 1 and 5 already have 3 and 6 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
5. Edge (2, 8): Nodes 2 and 8 already have 2 and 5 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
6. Edge (3, 1): Nodes 3 and 1 already have 4 and 3 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
7. Edge (3, 8): Nodes 3 and 8 already have 4 and 5 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
8. Edge (3, 9): Nodes 3 and 9 already have 4 and 4 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
9. Edge (4, 7): Nodes 4 and 7 already have 1 and 2 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
10. Edge (5, 0): Nodes 5 and 0 already have 6 and 3 connections respectively, forming a triangle with Node 1. <0, 1, 5>
11. Edge (5, 1): Nodes 5 and 1 already have 6 and 3 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
12. Edge (5, 6): Nodes 5 and 6 already have 6 and 1 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
13. Edge (5, 7): Nodes 5 and 7 already have 6 and 2 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
14. Edge (5, 9): Nodes 5 and 9 already have 6 and 4 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
15. Edge (6, 5): Nodes 6 and 5 already have 1 and 6 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
16. Edge (7, 4): Nodes 7 and 4 already have 2 and 1 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
17. Edge (7, 5): Nodes 7 and 5 already have 2 and 6 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
18. Edge (8, 0): Nodes 8 and 0 already have 5 and 3 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
19. Edge (8, 2): Nodes 8 and 2 already have 5 and 2 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
20. Edge (8, 3): Nodes 8 and 3 already have 5 and 4 connections respectively, forming a triangle with Node 5. <3, 5, 8>
21. Edge (8, 9): Nodes 8 and 9 already have 5 and 4 connections respectively, forming a triangle with Node 3. <3, 8, 9>
22. Edge (9, 3): Nodes 9 and 3 already have 4 and 4 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
23. Edge (9, 5): Nodes 9 and 5 already have 4 and 6 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.
24. Edge (9, 8): Nodes 9 and 8 already have 4 and 5 connections respectively, so no triangle is formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 5>, <3, 5, 8>
