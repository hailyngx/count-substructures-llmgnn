Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Vertex 5 has degree 1
- Vertices 1 and 6 have degree 2
- Vertices 0 and 8 have degree 3
- Vertices 4 and 5 have degree 4
- Vertices 2 and 3 have degree 5
- Vertex 9 has degree 6

2. Renumber the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 5 (degree 1) -> new label 0
- Vertices 1 and 6 (degree 2) -> new labels 1 and 2
- Vertices 0 and 8 (degree 3) -> new labels 3 and 4
- Vertices 4 and 5 (degree 4) -> new labels 5 and 6
- Vertices 2 and 3 (degree 5) -> new labels 7 and 8
- Vertex 9 (degree 6) -> new label 9

3. Count the triangles forming:
- From the given edges, we can count the triangles:
  - Triangle 1: <0, 4, 8>
  - Triangle 2: <3, 4, 9>
  - Triangle 3: <4, 7, 9>
  - Triangle 4: <7, 8, 9>
  - Triangle 5: <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
