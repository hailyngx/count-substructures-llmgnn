Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 2: 9 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
1. <1, 5, 6>
2. <2, 7, 8>
3. <2, 7, 3>
4. <2, 7, 4>
5. <2, 3, 4>
6. <2, 3, 8>
7. <2, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
