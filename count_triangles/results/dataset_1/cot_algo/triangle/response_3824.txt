Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels are:  
Node 2 has 2 connections  
Node 4 has 1 connection  
Node 7 has 2 connections  
Node 1 has 3 connections  
Node 3 has 4 connections  
Node 6 has 4 connections  
Node 0 has 5 connections  
Node 8 has 5 connections  
Node 9 has 4 connections  
Node 5 has 4 connections  

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will now count the triangles in the graph:  

1. (0, 1): Shared connections with node 8 form the triangle <0, 1, 8>.  
2. (0, 4): No triangles formed.  
3. (0, 7): No triangles formed.  
4. (0, 8): Shared connections with nodes 1 and 9 form the triangles <0, 8, 1> and <0, 8, 9>.  
5. (0, 9): No triangles formed.  
6. (1, 5): Shared connection with node 3 forms the triangle <1, 5, 3>.  
7. (1, 8): Shared connections with nodes 0 and 2 form the triangles <1, 8, 0> and <1, 8, 2>.  
8. (2, 3): No triangles formed.  
9. (2, 8): Shared connection with node 1 forms the triangle <2, 8, 1>.  
10. (3, 5): Shared connections with nodes 1, 8, and 9 form the triangles <3, 5, 1>, <3, 5, 8>, and <3, 5, 9>.  
11. (3, 8): Shared connections with nodes 1 and 9 form the triangles <3, 8, 1> and <3, 8, 9>.  
12. (4, 0): No triangles formed.  
13. (5, 3): Shared connections with nodes 1 and 9 form the triangles <5, 3, 1> and <5, 3, 9>.  
14. (5, 6): No triangles formed.  
15. (5, 9): Shared connection with node 3 forms the triangle <5, 9, 3>.  
16. (6, 7): No triangles formed.  
17. (6, 9): Shared connection with node 5 forms the triangle <6, 9, 5>.  
18. (7, 0): No triangles formed.  
19. (7, 6): No triangles formed.  
20. (8, 0): Shared connections with nodes 1 and 9 form the triangles <8, 0, 1> and <8, 0, 9>.  
21. (8, 1): Shared connections with nodes 0 and 2 form the triangles <8, 1, 0> and <8, 1, 2>.  
22. (8, 2): Shared connection with node 1 forms the triangle <8, 2, 1>.  
23. (8, 3): Shared connections with nodes 1 and 9 form the triangles <8, 3, 1> and <8, 3, 9>.  
24. (9, 0): No triangles formed.  
25. (9, 5): Shared connection with node 3 forms the triangle <9, 5, 3>.  
26. (9, 6): Shared connection with node 5 forms the triangle <9, 6, 5>.  

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
