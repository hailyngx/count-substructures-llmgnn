Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the new labels will be: 

Nodes: 7, 4, 9, 6, 1, 8, 3, 2, 5, 0

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we examine the edges in the following order:

1. (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 share Node 2 as a common connection. Triangle found: <0, 2, 5>
2. (0, 9): No triangle formed.
3. (1, 2): No triangle formed.
4. (1, 3): Nodes 1 and 3 share Node 5 as a common connection. Triangle found: <1, 3, 5>
5. (1, 6): No triangle formed.
6. (2, 1): No triangle formed.
7. (2, 5): No triangle formed.
8. (3, 1): No triangle formed.
9. (3, 5): No triangle formed.
10. (4, 5): No triangle formed.
11. (5, 0): No triangle formed.
12. (5, 2): No triangle formed.
13. (5, 3): No triangle formed.
14. (5, 4): No triangle formed.
15. (6, 1): No triangle formed.
16. (6, 8): No triangle formed.
17. (7, 8): No triangle formed.
18. (8, 6): No triangle formed.
19. (8, 7): No triangle formed.
20. (9, 0): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 5>
