Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted order of vertices is as follows:
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 5
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 0: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 4

Since we have sorted the vertices, we will now count the triangles:
- Triangle <2, 3, 4> (shared connections: 0)
- Triangle <2, 4, 6> (shared connections: 5)
- Triangle <4, 6, 9> (shared connections: 2)
- Triangle <5, 6, 7> (shared connections: none)
- Triangle <5, 6, 8> (shared connections: none)
- Triangle <6, 7, 9> (shared connections: none)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
