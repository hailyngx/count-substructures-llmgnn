Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

0: 1 connection
3: 1 connection
5: 1 connection
4: 1 connection
1: 2 connections
7: 3 connections
6: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
8: 5 connections
2: 5 connections

Now, let's list the edges in the order according to the sorted vertices:

(0, 2) (6, 1) (1, 9) (3, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (2, 6) (7, 9) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (2, 8) (6, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) (4, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by the shared connections:

Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <1, 6, 9> <1, 7, 9> <1, 9, 7> <2, 6, 7> <2, 6, 8> <2, 8, 7> <2, 8, 9> <3, 4, 8> <7, 8, 9>
