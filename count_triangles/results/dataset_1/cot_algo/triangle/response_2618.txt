Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
Vertices with their connections:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 5 connections
- Vertex 2: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 4 (1 connection) -> relabeled as Vertex 0
- Vertex 0 (2 connections) -> relabeled as Vertex 1
- Vertex 3 (2 connections) -> relabeled as Vertex 2
- Vertex 6 (2 connections) -> relabeled as Vertex 3
- Vertex 9 (2 connections) -> relabeled as Vertex 4
- Vertex 2 (3 connections) -> relabeled as Vertex 5
- Vertex 7 (3 connections) -> relabeled as Vertex 6
- Vertex 8 (3 connections) -> relabeled as Vertex 7
- Vertex 5 (3 connections) -> relabeled as Vertex 8
- Vertex 1 (5 connections) -> relabeled as Vertex 9

Now, let's go through the edges based on the relabeled vertices and count the triangles:
Triangles: <3, 6, 7>, <1, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
