Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order. After relabeling the nodes accordingly, the sorted nodes are: 

Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 6 connections.
Node 3 has 6 connections.

Now we proceed to count the triangles by examining each edge. Since we only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we will look at the following edges: 
(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 8), (4, 1), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 8), (9, 5).

After checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles: 
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 0>, <2, 0, 3>, <2, 0, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 0>, <6, 8, 1>, <6, 8, 7>, <6, 9, 5>, <7, 5, 9>, <9, 6, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
