Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each vertex has:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we relabel the nodes:
- Node 0 (2 connections) becomes Node 0
- Node 1 (2 connections) becomes Node 1
- Node 3 (4 connections) becomes Node 2
- Node 4 (3 connections) becomes Node 3
- Node 5 (2 connections) becomes Node 4
- Node 6 (3 connections) becomes Node 5
- Node 7 (2 connections) becomes Node 6
- Node 8 (2 connections) becomes Node 7
- Node 9 (2 connections) becomes Node 8

Now, we will count the triangles. 
1. Edge (0, 6) connects Node 0 and Node 5. No triangles.
2. Edge (0, 7) connects Node 0 and Node 6. No triangles.
3. Edge (0, 8) connects Node 0 and Node 7. No triangles.
4. Edge (1, 4) connects Node 1 and Node 3. No triangles.
5. Edge (1, 5) connects Node 1 and Node 4. No triangles.
6. Edge (1, 7) connects Node 1 and Node 6. No triangles.
7. Edge (3, 4) connects Node 2 and Node 3. No triangles.
8. Edge (3, 5) connects Node 2 and Node 4. No triangles.
9. Edge (3, 6) connects Node 2 and Node 5. This edge forms a triangle with (0, 6). <0, 2, 5>
10. Edge (3, 7) connects Node 2 and Node 6. No triangles.
11. Edge (3, 9) connects Node 2 and Node 8. No triangles.
12. Edge (4, 1) connects Node 3 and Node 1. No triangles.
13. Edge (4, 3) connects Node 3 and Node 2. No triangles.
14. Edge (4, 8) connects Node 3 and Node 7. No triangles.
15. Edge (5, 1) connects Node 4 and Node 1. No triangles.
16. Edge (5, 3) connects Node 4 and Node 2. No triangles.
17. Edge (6, 0) connects Node 5 and Node 0. No triangles.
18. Edge (6, 3) connects Node 5 and Node 2. No triangles.
19. Edge (6, 9) connects Node 5 and Node 8. No triangles.
20. Edge (7, 0) connects Node 6 and Node 0. No triangles.
21. Edge (7, 1) connects Node 6 and Node 1. No triangles.
22. Edge (7, 3) connects Node 6 and Node 2. No triangles.
23. Edge (8, 0) connects Node 7 and Node 0. No triangles.
24. Edge (8, 4) connects Node 7 and Node 3. No triangles.
25. Edge (9, 3) connects Node 8 and Node 2. No triangles.
26. Edge (9, 6) connects Node 8 and Node 5. No triangles.

There is 1 triangle found which is <0, 2, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1].
