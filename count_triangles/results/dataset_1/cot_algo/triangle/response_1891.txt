Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degrees for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: Degree = 2
- Node 1: Degree = 3
- Node 2: Degree = 3
- Node 4: Degree = 3
- Node 5: Degree = 1
- Node 6: Degree = 3
- Node 7: Degree = 3
- Node 8: Degree = 2
- Node 9: Degree = 4

Rearranging nodes in ascending order of degrees: 5, 0, 8, 2, 4, 6, 7, 1, 9

Now, considering edges in the same order as given and only proceeding if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (5, 2): Forms a triangle with node 2 and node 4. Triangle: <5, 2, 4>
2. (0, 9): Forms a triangle with node 0 and node 1. Triangle: <0, 9, 1>
3. (0, 1): No triangles formed.
4. (2, 5): No triangles formed.
5. (2, 8): No triangles formed.
6. (4, 2): No triangles formed.
7. (4, 6): Forms a triangle with node 2 and node 1. Triangle: <4, 6, 1>
8. (6, 1): No triangles formed.
9. (6, 7): Forms a triangle with node 7 and node 1. Triangle: <6, 7, 1>
10. (7, 1): No triangles formed.
11. (9, 8): Forms a triangle with node 8 and node 2. Triangle: <9, 8, 2>
12. (9, 7): Forms a triangle with node 7 and node 4. Triangle: <9, 7, 4>
13. (9, 0): No triangles formed.
14. (9, 4): Forms a triangle with node 4 and node 6. Triangle: <9, 4, 6>
15. (1, 6): No triangles formed.
16. (1, 7): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <5, 2, 4>, <0, 9, 1>, <4, 6, 1>, <6, 7, 1>, <9, 8, 2>, <9, 7, 4>, <9, 4, 6>
