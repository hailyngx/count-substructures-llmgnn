Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The sorted order for the given graph is as follows:
Vertices: 1, 9, 4, 6, 8, 3, 5, 7, 0, 2

Now, we check each edge and count the triangles formed:
- Edge (0, 1): Both 0 and 1 have 3 connections (7, 5, 4), so we can form a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
- Edge (0, 5): 0 has 3 connections (7, 1, 5) while 5 has 4 connections (3, 2, 0, 2), so no triangle is formed.
- Edge (0, 7): Both 0 and 7 have 3 connections (5, 2, 3), forming triangle <0, 7, 5>.
- Edge (1, 4): Both 1 and 4 have 3 connections (0, 2, 5), forming triangle <1, 4, 2>.
- Edge (2, 4): Both 2 and 4 have 4 connections (8, 5, 1, 0), forming triangle <2, 4, 1>.
- Edge (2, 5): Both 2 and 5 have 4 connections (8, 7, 3, 0), forming triangle <2, 5, 0>.
- Edge (2, 7): Both 2 and 7 have 4 connections (8, 3, 0, 0), forming triangle <2, 7, 0>.
- Edge (2, 8): Both 2 and 8 have 3 connections (9, 7, 4), so we can form a triangle <2, 8, 7>.
- Edge (3, 5): Both 3 and 5 have 4 connections (7, 6, 2, 0), forming triangle <3, 5, 0>.
- Edge (3, 6): Both 3 and 6 have 3 connections (9, 7, 5), so we can form a triangle <3, 6, 9>.
- Edge (3, 7): Both 3 and 7 have 4 connections (2, 6, 0, 0), forming triangle <3, 7, 0>.
- Edge (6, 9): Both 6 and 9 have 3 connections (8, 3, 6), forming triangle <6, 9, 8>.
- Edge (8, 9): Both 8 and 9 have 3 connections (6, 2, 9), so we can form a triangle <8, 9, 6>.

We have found the following triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 7, 5>, <1, 4, 2>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 5, 0>, <2, 7, 0>, <2, 8, 7>, <3, 5, 0>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 0>, <6, 9, 8>, <8, 9, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
