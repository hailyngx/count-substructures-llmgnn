Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's arrange the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections):

0: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
3: 3 connections
6: 2 connections
8: 3 connections
2: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
9: 3 connections
4: (isolated node)

Now, we will iterate through the edges in increasing order of the minimum degree of the vertices they connect to count the triangles. Since node 4 is isolated, we can exclude it from further consideration.

The triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 9, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [21].
