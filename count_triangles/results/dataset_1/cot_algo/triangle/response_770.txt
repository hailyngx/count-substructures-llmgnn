Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 0 has 3 connections.
Vertex 1 has 1 connection.
Vertex 2 has 2 connections.
Vertex 8 has 2 connections.
Vertex 7 has 2 connections.
Vertex 5 has 4 connections.
Vertex 4 has 4 connections.
Vertex 6 has 4 connections.
Vertex 9 has 4 connections.
Vertex 3 has 5 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles as follows:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 6>
7. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
8. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
9. Triangle <3, 6, 9>
10. Triangle <4, 5, 7>
11. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
12. Triangle <5, 7, 9>
13. Triangle <6, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
