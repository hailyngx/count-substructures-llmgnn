Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

- Node 0 has 2 connections.
- Node 7 has 1 connection.
- Node 2 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 4 and 5 each have 4 connections.
- Nodes 3 and 9 each have 5 connections.
- Nodes 1 and 6 each have 6 connections.
- Node 8 has 4 connections.

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degree:

- Node 0 (2 connections) becomes Node 0.
- Node 7 (1 connection) becomes Node 1.
- Node 2 (1 connection) becomes Node 2.
- Node 4 (4 connections) becomes Node 3.
- Node 5 (4 connections) becomes Node 4.
- Node 3 (5 connections) becomes Node 5.
- Node 9 (5 connections) becomes Node 6.
- Node 1 (6 connections) becomes Node 7.
- Node 6 (6 connections) becomes Node 8.
- Node 8 (4 connections) becomes Node 9.

Now, we traverse the edges in the order of the relabeled nodes:

- Edge (0, 1): Check for shared connections. Node 0 and Node 1 share Node 5. Triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- Edge (0, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 3): Check for shared connections. Node 1 and Node 3 share Nodes 4 and 5. Triangles <1, 3, 4> and <1, 3, 5>.
- Edge (1, 4): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 5): The triangle <3, 5, 8> is found.
- Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, and <3, 5, 8>.
