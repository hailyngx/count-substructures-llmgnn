Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections):
   - Node 0: degree 5
   - Node 1: degree 5
   - Node 2: degree 4
   - Node 3: degree 4
   - Node 4: degree 3
   - Node 5: degree 2
   - Node 6: degree 4
   - Node 7: degree 4
   - Node 8: degree 7
   - Node 9: degree 4

2. Relabel the vertices:
   - Node 5: 0
   - Node 6: 1
   - Node 3: 2
   - Node 4: 3
   - Node 2: 4
   - Node 0: 5
   - Node 1: 6
   - Node 7: 7
   - Node 9: 8
   - Node 8: 9

3. Check the edges (sorted by the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections):
   - Edge (5, 2): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0. <0, 2, 5>
   - Edge (5, 3): No triangle formed.
   - Edge (5, 4): No triangle formed.
   - Edge (5, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 8. <5, 8, 9>
   - Edge (6, 1): No triangle formed.
   - Edge (3, 2): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0. <0, 2, 3>
   - Edge (4, 3): No triangle formed.
   - Edge (4, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0. <0, 4, 8>
   - Edge (2, 0): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3. <0, 3, 2>
   - Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.
   - Edge (2, 6): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1. <1, 2, 6>
   - Edge (2, 7): No triangle formed.
   - Edge (3, 0): Forms a triangle with shared connection 4. <0, 3, 4>
   - Edge (0, 1): No triangle formed.
   - Edge (0, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection 2. <0, 2, 8>
   - Edge (7, 6): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1. <1, 6, 7>
   - Edge (7, 2): No triangle formed.
   - Edge (9, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3. <3, 7, 9>
   - Edge (9, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0. <0, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
