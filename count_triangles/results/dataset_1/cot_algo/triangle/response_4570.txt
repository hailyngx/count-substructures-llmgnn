Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling of the nodes is as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
