Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Nodes sorted by degree: [1, 7, 9, 3, 5, 4, 8, 6, 2, 0]

The triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method are:
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [7]
