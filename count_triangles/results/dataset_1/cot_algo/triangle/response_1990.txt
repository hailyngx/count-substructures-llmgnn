Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the triangles in the given graph.

The vertices are sorted by the number of connections:

Vertex 0: 0 connections
Vertex 6: 0 connections
Vertex 9: 0 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 6 connections

Using the method described, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <1, 3, 7>
2. Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <1, 4, 7>
3. Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <1, 4, 7>
4. Edge (3, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <3, 5, 7>
5. Edge (3, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <1, 3, 7>
6. Edge (4, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
