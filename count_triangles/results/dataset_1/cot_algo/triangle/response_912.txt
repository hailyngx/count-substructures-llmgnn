Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels are: <2, 0, 5, 9, 7, 1, 4, 6, 8, 3>.

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

For edge (0, 1):
Node 0 has connections with nodes 1 and 6.
Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 5, and 6.
Shared connections between nodes 0 and 1: 1 node (6).
Therefore, <0, 1, 6> is a triangle.

For edge (0, 6):
Node 0 has connections with nodes 1 and 6.
Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 7.
Shared connections between nodes 0 and 6: 1 node (1).
Therefore, <0, 1, 6> is again a triangle.

For edge (1, 5):
Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 5, and 6.
Node 5 has connections with nodes 1 and 7.
Shared connections between nodes 1 and 5: 1 node (7).
Therefore, <1, 5, 7> is a triangle.

For edge (1, 6):
Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 5, and 6.
Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 7.
Shared connections between nodes 1 and 6: 1 node (0).
Therefore, <0, 1, 6> is once again a triangle.

For edge (6, 7):
Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 7.
Node 7 has connections with nodes 5, 6, and 8.
Shared connections between nodes 6 and 7: 1 node (1).
Therefore, <1, 6, 7> is a triangle.

For edge (7, 8):
Node 7 has connections with nodes 5, 6, and 8.
Node 8 has connections with nodes 2 and 7.
Shared connections between nodes 7 and 8: 1 node (6).
Therefore, <6, 7, 8> is a triangle.

So, the total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 8>.
