Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees, the graph is as follows:

Nodes(from, degree): (0, 2) (1, 5) (7, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (9, 2) (6, 4) (8, 1) (5, 1) 

Calculating the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 3>

Total number of triangles: [5]
