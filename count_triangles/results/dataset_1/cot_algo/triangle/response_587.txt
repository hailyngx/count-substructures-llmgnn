Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on the number of connections:

Node 6: 1 connection  
Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 7: 1 connection  
Node 3: 1 connection  
Node 0: 2 connections  
Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 9: 4 connections  
Node 2: 5 connections  

Now, we will iterate through the edges in the sorted order and count the triangles:

Triangles: [9]  
Unique triangles: <2, 4, 8>
