Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given graph and the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:

Nodes: 7, 1, 9, 4, 8, 0, 5, 6, 3, 2

Now, we will check each edge and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge (0, 5): Node 0 has connections with nodes 5 and 9. Node 5 has connections with nodes 0 and 6. They share node 6. Therefore, <0, 5, 6> forms a triangle (since it is the only triangle possible with these nodes).

2. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 has connections with nodes 5 and 9. Node 9 has connections with node 0. They share node 0. Therefore, <0, 5, 9> forms a triangle.

3. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 has a connection with node 2. No triangles are formed since node 2 has only one connection.

4. Edge (2, 1): Node 1 has a connection with node 2. No triangles are formed since node 1 has only one connection.

5. Edge (2, 3): Node 2 has connections with nodes 1, 3, and 6. Node 3 has connections with nodes 2, 4, and 8. They share node 2. Therefore, <2, 3, 6> forms a triangle.

6. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 has connections with nodes 1, 3, and 6. Node 6 has connections with nodes 2, 5. They share node 2. Therefore, <2, 6, 5> forms a triangle.

7. Edge (3, 2): Node 2 has connections with nodes 1, 3, and 6. Node 3 has connections with nodes 2, 4, and 8. They share node 2. Therefore, <2, 3, 6> forms a triangle.

8. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has connections with nodes 2, 4, and 8. Node 4 has a connection with node 3. No triangles are formed since node 4 has only one connection.

9. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 has connections with nodes 2, 4, and 8. Node 8 has a connection with node 3. No triangles are formed since node 8 has only one connection.

10. Edge (5, 0): Node 0 has connections with nodes 5 and 9. Node 5 has connections with nodes 0 and 6. They share node 0. Therefore, <0, 5, 6> forms a triangle.

11. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 has connections with nodes 0 and 6. Node 6 has connections with nodes 2, 5. They share 5. Therefore, <5, 6, 2> forms a triangle.

12. Edge (6, 2): Node 2 has connections with nodes 1, 3, and 6. Node 6 has connections with nodes 2, 5. They share node 2. Therefore, <2, 6, 5> forms a triangle.

13. Edge (6, 5): Node 5 has connections with nodes 0 and 6. Node 6 has connections with nodes 2, 5. They share node 5. Therefore, <5, 6, 0> forms a triangle.

14. Edge (8, 3): Node 3 has connections with nodes 2, 4 and 8. Node 8 has a connection with node 3. No triangles are formed since node 8 has only one connection.

15. Edge (9, 0): Node 0 has connections with nodes 5 and 9. Node 9 has connections with node 0. They share node 0. Therefore, <0, 9, 5> forms a triangle.

Finally, we have found 6 triangles in the graph. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
