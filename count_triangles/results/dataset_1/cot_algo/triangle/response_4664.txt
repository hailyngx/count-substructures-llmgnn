Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 6 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting triangles:

1. (2, 3) - Shared connection with vertex 1 forms a triangle: <1, 2, 3>
2. (4, 7) - Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle: <4, 5, 7>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
