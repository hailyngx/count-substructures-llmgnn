Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

The sorted vertices are:
2, 8, 9, 3, 0, 7, 1, 6, 4, 5

Now, starting from the vertex with the lowest degree, we will count the number of triangles formed by each edge:

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

The total number of triangles is [8].
