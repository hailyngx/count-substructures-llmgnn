Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
Vertices sorted by degree: 
0 (3 connections)
1 (1 connection)
7 (4 connections)
6 (2 connections)
9 (1 connection)
5 (4 connections)
4 (4 connections)
8 (3 connections)
3 (5 connections)
2 (5 connections)

Using the sorted list, we can relabel the vertices:
New labels: 
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
7 -> 2
6 -> 3
9 -> 4
5 -> 5
4 -> 6
8 -> 7
3 -> 8
2 -> 9

Now, we will iterate through the edges while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Triangles found: <2, 0, 7> <2, 3, 4> <2, 3, 5> <2, 5, 8> <3, 4, 5> <3, 4, 6> <3, 5, 8> <4, 5, 8> 

Total number of triangles: [8]
