Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0 has 2 connections
- Vertex 1 has 2 connections
- Vertex 2 has 2 connections
- Vertex 3 has 4 connections
- Vertex 4 has 1 connection
- Vertex 5 has 5 connections
- Vertex 6 has 1 connection
- Vertex 7 has 1 connection
- Vertex 8 has 1 connection
- Vertex 9 has 1 connection

Now, we will assign new labels to vertices based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 0 (2 connections) will be relabeled as A
- Vertex 1 (2 connections) will be relabeled as B
- Vertex 2 (2 connections) will be relabeled as C
- Vertex 3 (4 connections) will be relabeled as D
- Vertex 4 (1 connection) will be relabeled as E
- Vertex 5 (5 connections) will be relabeled as F
- Vertex 6 (1 connection) will be relabeled as G
- Vertex 7 (1 connection) will be relabeled as H
- Vertex 8 (1 connection) will be relabeled as I
- Vertex 9 (1 connection) will be relabeled as J

Next, we will list the edges in the graph based on the new labels:
- (A, B)
- (A, D)
- (B, A)
- (B, F)
- (C, D)
- (C, F)
- (D, A)
- (D, C)
- (D, F)
- (E, I)
- (F, B)
- (F, C)
- (F, D)
- (F, J)
- (G, H)
- (H, G)
- (I, E)
- (J, F)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by these edges:
There are 3 triangles in total.
The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<5, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
