Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method.

First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

- Vertex 4: degree 0
- Vertex 2: degree 1
- Vertex 8: degree 1
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 9

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

- Vertex 4 (degree 0) -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 2 (degree 1) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 8 (degree 1) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 0 (degree 2) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 9 (degree 2) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 5 (degree 2) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 6 (degree 2) -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 7 (degree 2) -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 3 (degree 3) -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 1 (degree 9) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will list the edges only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Vertex 0 (3 connections): 
  - (0, 1)
  - (0, 9)

- Vertex 1 (1 connection):
  - (1, 2)
  - (1, 3)
  - (1, 5)
  - (1, 6)
  - (1, 7)
  - (1, 8)

- Vertex 2 (2 connections):
  - (2, 1)

- Vertex 4 (2 connections):
  - (4, 0)
  - (4, 3)

- Vertex 5 (2 connections):
  - (5, 1)
  - (5, 6)

- Vertex 6 (2 connections):
  - (6, 1)
  - (6, 5)

- Vertex 7 (2 connections):
  - (7, 1)
  - (7, 3)

- Vertex 8 (1 connection):
  - (8, 1)

- Vertex 9 (0 connections):
  - (9, 3)

By examining the shared connections, we can find the triangles:

- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 7, 3>
- <1, 7, 3>

Counting unique triangles, we have 2 unique triangles.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
