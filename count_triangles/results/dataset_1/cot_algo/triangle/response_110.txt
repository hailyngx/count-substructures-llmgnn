Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, the sorted list of vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 9, 8, 1, 4, 2, 7, 5, 6, 3, 0

Upon examining each edge while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 0>
