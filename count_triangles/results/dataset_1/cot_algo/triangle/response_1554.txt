Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:
    0 -- 4
    | \
    |  \
    |   \
    1 -- 3 -- 7 -- 5
     \   |  /   /
      \  | /   /
        8 -- 2
         \
          \
           9

After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels are:
    Vertex 5: 0 connections
    Vertex 6: 1 connection
    Vertex 0: 1 connection
    Vertex 7: 2 connections
    Vertex 1: 2 connections
    Vertex 2: 3 connections
    Vertex 4: 3 connections
    Vertex 8: 4 connections
    Vertex 3: 5 connections
    Vertex 9: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the triangles in the graph:
1. <1, 3, 4>
2. <1, 3, 8>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <1, 7, 5>
5. <1, 8, 5>
6. <2, 4, 8>
7. <2, 4, 0>
8. <2, 9, 8>
9. <3, 7, 5>
10. <3, 8, 5>
11. <3, 9, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
