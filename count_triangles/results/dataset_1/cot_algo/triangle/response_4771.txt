Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the relabeling of the nodes is:
Node 0 -> Degree 3
Node 1 -> Degree 3
Node 2 -> Degree 1
Node 3 -> Degree 2
Node 4 -> Degree 3
Node 6 -> Degree 3
Node 7 -> Degree 3
Node 8 -> Degree 2
Node 9 -> Degree 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will identify the triangles in the graph:
1. For edge (0, 1): Nodes 0 and 1 share connections with Node 4, forming triangle <0, 1, 4>.
2. For edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 already form a triangle with Node 1, so no new triangle is formed.
3. For edge (0, 8): No triangle is formed as Node 0 and Node 8 do not have a common connection.
4. For edge (1, 4): No new triangle is formed as the triangle <0, 1, 4> is already counted.
5. For edge (1, 7): Nodes 1 and 7 share connections with Node 4, forming triangle <1, 4, 7>.
6. For edge (2, 9): No triangle is formed as Node 2 and Node 9 do not have common connections.
7. For edge (3, 6): No triangle is formed as Node 3 and Node 6 do not have common connections.
8. For edge (4, 7): Nodes 4 and 7 share connections with Node 1, forming triangle <1, 4, 7>.
9. For edge (6, 3): No triangle is formed as Node 3 and Node 6 do not have common connections.
10. For edge (6, 7): Nodes 6 and 7 share connections with Node 4, forming triangle <4, 6, 7>.
11. For edge (6, 9): No triangle is formed as Node 6 and Node 9 do not have common connections.
12. For edge (7, 1): No new triangle is formed as the triangle <1, 4, 7> is already counted.
13. For edge (7, 4): No new triangle is formed as the triangle <1, 4, 7> is already counted.
14. For edge (8, 0): No triangle is formed as Node 0 and Node 8 do not have common connections.
15. For edge (8, 9): No triangle is formed as Node 8 and Node 9 do not have common connections.
16. For edge (9, 2): No triangle is formed as Node 2 and Node 9 do not have common connections.
17. For edge (9, 6): No triangle is formed as Node 6 and Node 9 do not have common connections.
18. For edge (9, 8): No triangle is formed as Node 8 and Node 9 do not have common connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4> and <4, 6, 7>.
