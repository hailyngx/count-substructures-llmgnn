Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degrees:
- Vertex 0 has degree 4
- Vertex 1 has degree 3
- Vertex 2 has degree 2
- Vertex 3 has degree 3
- Vertex 4 has degree 3
- Vertex 5 has degree 2
- Vertex 6 has degree 6
- Vertex 7 has degree 4
- Vertex 8 has degree 2
- Vertex 9 has degree 5

Now, we'll relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0 (degree 2)
- Vertex 1 (degree 2)
- Vertex 2 (degree 2)
- Vertex 3 (degree 3)
- Vertex 4 (degree 3)
- Vertex 5 (degree 3)
- Vertex 6 (degree 4)
- Vertex 7 (degree 4)
- Vertex 8 (degree 5)
- Vertex 9 (degree 6)

Next, we will count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge. 
In this graph, the triangles formed are:
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <3, 8, 0>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>

Finally, since each triangle is only counted once using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles in this graph is [10].
