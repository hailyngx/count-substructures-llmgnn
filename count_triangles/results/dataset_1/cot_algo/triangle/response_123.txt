Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of edges they are connected to, from least to most. Let's relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertices in order of increasing degree:
0 (degree: 2)
3 (degree: 2)
8 (degree: 2)
2 (degree: 2)
1 (degree: 2)
7 (degree: 3)
4 (degree: 4)
5 (degree: 4)
9 (degree: 5)
6 (degree: 6)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

- Edge (0, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (0, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 6): Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>
- Edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 4): Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>
- Edge (6, 1): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 2): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 4): Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>
- Edge (6, 9): Triangle formed: <4, 6, 9>
- Edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 4): Triangle formed: <4, 5, 7>
- Edge (7, 9): Triangle formed: <4, 7, 9>
- Edge (8, 0): No triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 0): No triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 6): Triangle formed: <4, 6, 9>
- Edge (9, 7): Triangle formed: <4, 7, 9>

Count of unique triangles: <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [3]
