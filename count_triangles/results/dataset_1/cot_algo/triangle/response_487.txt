Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method is as follows:

Nodes by degree: 

0: 5 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 6 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 6 connections

Relabeling the vertices:

Node 1 (degree 2) -> A
Node 2 (degree 2) -> B
Node 5 (degree 2) -> C
Node 6 (degree 2) -> D
Node 7 (degree 2) -> E
Node 0 (degree 5) -> F
Node 4 (degree 3) -> G
Node 8 (degree 3) -> H
Node 3 (degree 6) -> I
Node 9 (degree 6) -> J

Edges to consider (lower labeled vertex comes first):

(A, F) (B, I) (C, F) (D, I) (E, A) 
(F, C) (F, G) (F, I) (F, J) (G, F) 
(G, I) (G, J) (I, J) (D, J) (H, I) 
(H, J) (I, J)
