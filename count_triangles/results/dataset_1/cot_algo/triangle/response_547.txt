Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we get the following ordering:
Node 5: (0 connections)
Node 1: (1 connection)
Node 4: (1 connection)
Node 6: (2 connections)
Node 9: (2 connections)
Node 2: (2 connections)
Node 7: (2 connections)
Node 3: (3 connections)
Node 8: (5 connections)
Node 0: (5 connections)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 7), (6, 8), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 8)

The triangles formed by these edges are: 
<0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [7].
