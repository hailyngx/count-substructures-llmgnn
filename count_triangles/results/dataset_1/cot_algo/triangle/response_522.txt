Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order, the new vertex labels are as follows: 

Vertices: 
1. Node 3 (Degree 1)
2. Node 2 (Degree 1)
3. Node 1 (Degree 1)
4. Node 6 (Degree 2)
5. Node 5 (Degree 2)
6. Node 7 (Degree 2)
7. Node 4 (Degree 3)
8. Node 0 (Degree 5)
9. Node 8 (Degree 5)

Using the degree-based ordering method, we count the number of triangles:

[Total Number of Triangles: 9]

Unique triangles found:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <0, 4, 6>
5. <4, 5, 8>
6. <5, 6, 7>
7. <4, 7, 8>
8. <6, 7, 8>
9. <0, 7, 8>
