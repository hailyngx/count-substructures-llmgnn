Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help in counting the number of triangles in the given graph. 

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Now, we will examine each edge based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections.

Triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [9]
