Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have the following labels:
Node 1 has 1 connection.  
Node 7 has 2 connection.  
Node 2 has 2 connection.  
Node 4 has 1 connection.  
Node 9 has 2 connection.  
Node 3 has 2 connection.  
Node 8 has 3 connection.  
Node 0 has 5 connection.  
Node 5 has 6 connection.  
Node 6 has 5 connection.  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we go through each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Examining edge (0, 3): Nodes 0 and 3 share nodes 9 and 5, forming the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
- Examining edge (0, 4): No triangle is formed as node 4 has fewer connections than node 0.
- Examining edge (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 share nodes 6 and 2, forming the triangle <0, 5, 6> and the triangle <0, 5, 2>.
- Examining edge (0, 6): Nodes 0 and 6 share nodes 2 and 5, forming the triangle <0, 6, 2> and the triangle <0, 6, 5>.
- Examining edge (0, 9): No triangle is formed as node 9 has fewer connections than node 0.
- Examining edge (1, 7): No triangle is formed as node 1 has fewer connections than node 7.
- Examining edge (2, 5): No triangle is formed as node 2 has fewer connections than node 5.
- Examining edge (2, 6): No triangle is formed as node 2 has fewer connections than node 6.
- Examining edge (3, 9): No triangle is formed as node 3 has fewer connections than node 9.
- Examining edge (5, 6): Nodes 5 and 6 share nodes 0 and 8, forming the triangle <5, 6, 0> and the triangle <5, 6, 8>.
- Examining edge (5, 7): No triangle is formed as node 7 has fewer connections than node 5.
- Examining edge (5, 8): No triangle is formed as node 5 has fewer connections than node 8.
- Examining edge (6, 8): Nodes 6 and 8 share nodes 5 and 7, forming the triangle <6, 8, 5> and the triangle <6, 8, 7>.

The total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 5>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 5>.
