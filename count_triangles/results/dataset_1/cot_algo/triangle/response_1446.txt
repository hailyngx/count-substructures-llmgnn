Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree from least to most:
- Node 1: 0
- Node 8: 1
- Node 2: 2
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 4
- Node 6: 5
- Node 0: 6
- Node 7: 7
- Node 9: 8
- Node 5: 9

Next, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:
- (0, 2): No triangle
- (0, 3): No triangle
- (0, 6): No triangle
- (0, 7): No triangle
- (1, 5): No triangle
- (2, 6): No triangle
- (2, 9): No triangle
- (3, 5): Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- (3, 7): No triangle
- (4, 5): No triangle
- (4, 7): No triangle
- (4, 9): Triangle <4, 5, 9>
- (5, 6): Triangle <0, 5, 6>
- (5, 8): No triangle
- (5, 9): No triangle
- (6, 7): No triangle
- (7, 9): No triangle
- (8, 9): No triangle

Counting the triangles found:
- Total triangles: [3]
- Unique triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 6>
