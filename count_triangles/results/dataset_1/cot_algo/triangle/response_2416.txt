Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:  
0 -> 4 connections  
1 -> 3 connections  
2 -> 2 connections  
3 -> 4 connections  
4 -> 2 connections  
5 -> 4 connections  
6 -> 2 connections  
7 -> 2 connections  
8 -> 4 connections  
9 -> 2 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  

The triangles formed by the shared connections are:  
<0, 7, 8>  
<1, 3, 6>  
<3, 4, 5>  

Thus, the total number of triangles is [3].
