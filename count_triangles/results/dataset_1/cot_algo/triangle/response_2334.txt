Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each node has:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 7 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections

Now, we'll relabel the nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order:
Node 3 -> Node 0
Node 4 -> Node 1
Node 8 -> Node 2
Node 1 -> Node 3
Node 2 -> Node 4
Node 9 -> Node 5
Node 7 -> Node 6
Node 5 -> Node 7
Node 0 -> Node 8
Node 6 -> Node 9

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [<0, 1, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 9>] 

Total number of triangles: [6]
