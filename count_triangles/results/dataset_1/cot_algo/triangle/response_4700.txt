Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following order: 
Node 0 (degree 1)  
Node 6 (degree 1)  
Node 5 (degree 2)  
Node 4 (degree 2)  
Node 9 (degree 3)  
Node 3 (degree 3)  
Node 7 (degree 4)  
Node 1 (degree 5)  
Node 2 (degree 5)  
Node 8 (degree 5)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method on the given graph, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
Examining these edges, we find the following triangles: 
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 0>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 7, 4>
<8, 7, 4>
<8, 7, 2>
<1, 8, 2>
<5, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
