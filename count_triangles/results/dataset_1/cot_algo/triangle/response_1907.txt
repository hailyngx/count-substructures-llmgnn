Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the new list of edges to be checked for triangles is as follows:
(1, 4) (1, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (3, 5) (2, 4) (3, 8) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 9)

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the triangles and count them:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 6, 7>
3. <3, 4, 5>
4. <0, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
