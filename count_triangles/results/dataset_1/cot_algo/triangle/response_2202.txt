Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles formed by shared connections between vertices:

Number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 0>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 1>
