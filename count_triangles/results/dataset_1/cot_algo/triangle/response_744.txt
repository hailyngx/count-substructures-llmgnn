Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices is: 
```
1. 4 (degree 2)
2. 5 (degree 2)
3. 3 (degree 2)
4. 6 (degree 3)
5. 1 (degree 4)
6. 5 (degree 4)
7. 8 (degree 4)
8. 9 (degree 4)
9. 0 (degree 6)
10. 3 (degree 6)
```

Using the sorted list of vertices, we will check each edge while ensuring that the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. 

Examining the edges:

1. Edge (4, 5): Both vertices have degree 2, so no triangle.
2. Edge (4, 7): Both vertices have degree 2, so no triangle.
3. Edge (5, 4): Both vertices have degree 2, so no triangle.
4. Edge (6, 0): Vertices 6 and 0 share a connection with vertex 2, forming a triangle <0, 2, 6>.
5. Edge (6, 2): Vertices 6 and 2 share a connection with vertex 0, forming a triangle <0, 2, 6>.
6. Edge (8, 0): Vertices 8 and 0 share a connection with vertices 3 and 9, no triangle.
7. Edge (9, 2): Vertices 9 and 2 share a connection with vertices 7 and 8, no triangle.
8. Edge (9, 7): Vertices 9 and 7 share a connection with vertex 2, forming a triangle <2, 7, 9>.
9. Edge (9, 8): Vertices 9 and 8 share a connection with vertex 7, forming a triangle <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <2, 7, 9>, and <7, 8, 9>.
