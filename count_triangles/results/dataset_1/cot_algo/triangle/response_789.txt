Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

Vertices sorted by their connections:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

Based on the sorted vertices and connections, we can count the triangles:

- Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle <3, 5, 8>
- Triangle <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle <4, 5, 6>
- Triangle <5, 6, 9>
- Triangle <5, 6, 8>
- Triangle <5, 6, 4>

Total number of triangles: [8]
