Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:
1. Sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
   - Vertex 7: 0 connections
   - Vertices 9 and 1: 1 connection each
   - Vertices 2 and 4: 2 connections each
   - Vertices 3 and 6: 3 connections each
   - Vertices 5 and 8: 4 connections each
   - Vertex 0: 5 connections

2. Relabel the vertices based on their sorted order:
   - Vertex 7 (0 connections) becomes vertex 0
   - Vertex 9 (1 connection) becomes vertex 1
   - Vertex 1 (1 connection) becomes vertex 2
   - Vertex 2 (2 connections) becomes vertex 3
   - Vertex 4 (2 connections) becomes vertex 4
   - Vertex 3 (3 connections) becomes vertex 5
   - Vertex 6 (3 connections) becomes vertex 6
   - Vertex 5 (4 connections) becomes vertex 7
   - Vertex 8 (4 connections) becomes vertex 8
   - Vertex 0 (5 connections) becomes vertex 9

3. Count the triangles:
   - <2, 1, 0>
   - <3, 1, 0>
   - <4, 2, 3>
   - <4, 3, 5>
   - <5, 3, 1>
   - <5, 3, 6>
   - <5, 4, 2>
   - <5, 4, 6>
   - <5, 4, 3>
   - <6, 3, 1>
   - <6, 4, 5>
   - <6, 4, 3>
   - <7, 0, 8>
   - <8, 0, 5>
   - <8, 0, 6>
   - <8, 0, 7>
   - <8, 5, 6>
   - <8, 5, 7>
   - <8, 6, 7>
   - <9, 2, 0>
   - <9, 2, 5>
   - <9, 0, 5>
   - <9, 0, 8>
   - <9, 5, 8>
   - <9, 8, 0>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [26].
