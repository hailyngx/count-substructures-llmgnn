Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees. 

The degrees of the vertices are:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 5 connections

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0: 0 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 9: 5 connections

Based on the relabeled vertices, we analyze the edges starting from the vertex with the lower label.

Counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find:
[12]

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 9, 7>
<1, 9, 4>
<2, 5, 1>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 9, 4>
<3, 9, 7>
<4, 1, 9>
<5, 1, 9>
<6, 3, 9>
<9, 4, 1>
