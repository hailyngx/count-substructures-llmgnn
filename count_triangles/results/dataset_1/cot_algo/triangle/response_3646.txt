Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0 has degree 2
Vertex 1 has degree 3
Vertices 5 and 6 have degree 2
Vertices 9 and 8 have degree 2
Vertices 3 and 4 have degree 3
Vertex 7 has the highest degree of 6
Now, we need to relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0 (degree 2) becomes vertex 0
Vertices 5 and 6 (degree 2) become vertices 1 and 2
Vertices 9 and 8 (degree 2) become vertices 3 and 4
Vertices 3 and 4 (degree 3) become vertices 5 and 6
Vertices 1 (degree 3) becomes vertex 7
Vertex 7 (degree 6) becomes vertex 8
Next, we examine each edge in the graph by considering only those edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This ensures that each triangle is counted only once. By checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we can count the triangles and list them:

Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
Triangle 2: <1, 6, 7>
Triangle 3: <1, 7, 8>
Triangle 4: <2, 4, 7>
Triangle 5: <3, 4, 7>
Total number of triangles: [5]
