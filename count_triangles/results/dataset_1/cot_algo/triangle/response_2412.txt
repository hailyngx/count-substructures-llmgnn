Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections. 

The sorted list of vertices with their connections is as follows:
- Vertex 0: 1 connection
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 5 connections
- Vertex 2: 5 connections
- Vertex 3: 5 connections
- Vertex 1: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge to count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 1):
  - Vertex 0 is connected to Vertex 1.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (1, 3):
  - Vertex 1 is connected to Vertex 3.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (1, 7):
  - Vertex 1 is connected to Vertex 7.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (1, 8):
  - Vertex 1 is connected to Vertex 8.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (1, 9):
  - Vertex 1 is connected to Vertex 9.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (2, 3):
  - Vertex 2 is connected to Vertex 3.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (2, 4):
  - Vertex 2 is connected to Vertex 4.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (2, 5):
  - Vertex 2 is connected to Vertex 5.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (2, 6):
  - Vertex 2 is connected to Vertex 6.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (2, 9):
  - Vertex 2 is connected to Vertex 9.
  - Triangle is formed: <2, 6, 9>.

- Edge (3, 4):
  - Vertex 3 is connected to Vertex 4.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (3, 5):
  - Vertex 3 is connected to Vertex 5.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (4, 5):
  - Vertex 4 is connected to Vertex 5.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (4, 8):
  - Vertex 4 is connected to Vertex 8.
  - Triangle is formed: <4, 5, 8>.

- Edge (4, 9):
  - Vertex 4 is connected to Vertex 9.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (5, 6):
  - Vertex 5 is connected to Vertex 6.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (5, 8):
  - Vertex 5 is connected to Vertex 8.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (6, 7):
  - Vertex 6 is connected to Vertex 7.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (6, 8):
  - Vertex 6 is connected to Vertex 8.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (6, 9):
  - Vertex 6 is connected to Vertex 9.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (7, 8):
  - Vertex 7 is connected to Vertex 8.
  - No triangles are formed.

- Edge (8, 9):
  - Vertex 8 is connected to Vertex 9.
  - No triangles are formed.

Finally, we have counted 2 unique triangles: <2, 6, 9> and <4, 5, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
