Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the relabeled vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0 has 4 connections
Vertex 1 has 4 connections
Vertex 7 has 4 connections
Vertex 2 has 3 connections
Vertex 3 has 3 connections
Vertex 4 has 3 connections
Vertex 5 has 2 connections
Vertex 6 has 1 connections
Vertex 8 has 1 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we'll count the number of triangles by considering each edge. The triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 0>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 0, 3>
<2, 0, 7>
<2, 1, 0>
<2, 1, 7>
<3, 0, 7>
<4, 1, 7>
<4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
