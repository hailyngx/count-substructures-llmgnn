Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 1
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 6
Node 7 has degree 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles present in the graph:

1. (0, 3):
   - Shared connections with node 0: 5, 7
   - Triangle: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>

2. (0, 5):
   - Shared connection with node 0: 3
   - Triangle: <0, 3, 5>

3. (0, 7):
   - Shared connection with node 0: 3
   - Triangle: <0, 3, 7>

4. (1, 4):
   - No triangles formed.

5. (1, 6):
   - No triangles formed.

6. (1, 7):
   - Shared connection with node 1: 9
   - Triangle: <1, 7, 9>

7. (1, 9):
   - No triangles formed.
  
8. (2, 3):
   - No triangles formed.

9. (2, 7):
   - No triangles formed.

10. (3, 4):
    - Shared connection with node 3: 1
    - Triangle: <1, 3, 4>

... (The remaining edges are checked similarly but do not form additional triangles) ...

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <6, 7, 9>.
