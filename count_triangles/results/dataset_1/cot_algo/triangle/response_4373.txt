Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
1. Sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
    - Vertex 5 has 2 connections.
    - Vertices 7 and 4 have 3 connections.
    - Vertices 1 and 3 have 4 connections.
    - Vertices 0, 6, and 9 have 5 connections.
    - Vertex 2 has 6 connections.
    - Vertex 8 has 7 connections.

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
    - Vertex 5 -> 0
    - Vertex 7 -> 1
    - Vertex 4 -> 2
    - Vertex 1 -> 3
    - Vertex 3 -> 4
    - Vertex 0 -> 5
    - Vertex 6 -> 6
    - Vertex 9 -> 7
    - Vertex 2 -> 8
    - Vertex 8 -> 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. Calculating for edge (0, 1):
    - Vertex 0 connects with vertices 1, 3, 4, 8.
    - Vertex 1 connects with vertices 0, 2, 8.

    Only vertex 1 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    Shared connections between vertices 0 and 1 are: 1, 8. Hence, triangle <0, 1, 8>.

(counting all combinations and possibilities, we find that the number of triangles in this graph is 6.)

Output: [6]
