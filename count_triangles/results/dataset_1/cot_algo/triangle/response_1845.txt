Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Node 5 (Degree = 3)  
Node 7 (Degree = 3)  
Node 4 (Degree = 3)  
Node 6 (Degree = 4)  
Node 8 (Degree = 4)  
Node 1 (Degree = 4)  
Node 3 (Degree = 5)  
Node 2 (Degree = 5)  
Node 0 (Degree = 6)  
Node 9 (Degree = 7)  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Starting with the edge between nodes 0 and 2: Node 0 has 6 connections, Node 2 has 5 connections, and they share connections with nodes 3 and 9. This forms triangle <0, 2, 9>.  
2. Moving to the edge between nodes 0 and 3: Node 0 has 6 connections, Node 3 has 5 connections, and they share connections with nodes 2 and 9. This forms triangle <0, 3, 9>.  
3. Proceeding to the edge between nodes 0 and 6: Node 0 has 6 connections, Node 6 has 4 connections, and they share connections with nodes 1 and 9. This forms triangle <0, 6, 9>.  
4. Continuing with the edge between nodes 0 and 8: Node 0 has 6 connections, Node 8 has 4 connections, but they do not share any connections.  
5. Moving to the edge between nodes 0 and 9: Node 0 has 6 connections, Node 9 has 7 connections, and they share connections with nodes 2, 3, and 6. This forms triangles <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 9> (already counted), and <0, 6, 9> (already counted).
6. Proceeding with the rest of the edges similarly, we count additional triangles:  
    - Edge (1, 5): Triangle <1, 5, 7>  
    - Edge (1, 6): Triangle <1, 6, 0>  
    - Edge (1, 7): No new triangles  
    - Edge (1, 9): Triangle <1, 9, 0>  
    - Edge (3, 5): No new triangles  
    - Edge (3, 7): No new triangles  
    - Edge (4, 8): No new triangles  
    - Edge (4, 9): No new triangles  
    - Edge (6, 9): No new triangles  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
