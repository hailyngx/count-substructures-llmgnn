Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their degrees in increasing order, the new labeling of the nodes is as follows: 

Node 0: 2 connections 
Node 5: 2 connections 
Node 9: 2 connections 
Node 6: 3 connections 
Node 4: 4 connections 
Node 1: 4 connections 
Node 3: 4 connections 
Node 2: 5 connections 
Node 7: 6 connections 
Node 8: 6 connections 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check each edge to count the number of triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 3, 7> 
<0, 4, 7> 
<2, 7, 9> 
<2, 8, 9> 
<3, 4, 6> 
<3, 4, 7> 
<4, 6, 7> 
<7, 8, 9>
