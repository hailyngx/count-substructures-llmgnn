Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 1
Vertex 5: degree 1
Vertex 7: degree 1
Vertex 4: degree 0
Vertex 9: degree 2
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 5

Next, we will relabel the vertices:

Vertex 0 (degree 2) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 3 (degree 1) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 5 (degree 1) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 7 (degree 1) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 4 (degree 0) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 9 (degree 2) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 8 (degree 2) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 1 (degree 4) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 2 (degree 4) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 6 (degree 5) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will check for triangles:

- Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 and Vertex 1 share Vertex 6 -> Triangle <0, 1, 6>
- Edge (0, 9): Not considered due to sorting
- Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 and Vertex 2 share Vertex 6 -> Triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 and Vertex 6 share Vertex 2 -> Triangle <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 0>
- Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 and Vertex 8 share Vertex 6 -> Triangle <1, 8, 6>
- Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 and Vertex 6 share Vertex 1 -> Triangle <2, 6, 1>
- Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 and Vertex 9 share Vertex 0 -> Triangle <6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 1>

Total number of triangles: [7]
