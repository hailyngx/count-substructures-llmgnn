Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in this graph.

First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 5

Rearranging the nodes by their degrees:
Nodes by degree: 4, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5
Corresponding new labels: 9, 0, 1, 5, 4, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3

Now, applying the method and looking at each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with node 5: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with node 9: <0, 2, 9>
- Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 9 and 5: <0, 3, 5> and <0, 3, 9>
- Edge (0, 5) doesn't form a triangle since node 0 has more connections

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, and <0, 3, 9>.
