Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled based on their number of connections:
Vertices: [1, 0, 6, 7, 3, 5, 2, 4, 8, 9]

Now, we will go through each edge based on the vertex with the lower label:
1. (0, 3) - Both have 4, shared connections: 5, 9
2. (0, 4) - Both have 4, shared connections: 8, 9
3. (0, 8) - 0 has 4, shared connection: 4
4. (0, 9) - 0 has 4, shared connections: 3, 4, 8
5. (1, 2) - 1 has 1, 2 has 3, shared connection: 9
6. (1, 9) - 1 has 1, shared connection: 0, 2
7. (2, 5) - 2 has 3, shared connections: 1, 9
8. (4, 7) - 4 has 4, shared connections: 5, 8
9. (4, 8) - 4 has 4, shared connections: 0, 9
10. (5, 7) - 5 has 3, shared connection: 4
11. (9, 6) - 6 has 1, shared connection: 9

Total number of triangles: [11]
