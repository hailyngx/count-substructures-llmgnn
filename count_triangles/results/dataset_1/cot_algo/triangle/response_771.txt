Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0 is connected to [1, 2, 6]
Node 1 is connected to [0, 2, 3, 6, 9]
Node 2 is connected to [0, 1, 5, 7]
Node 3 is connected to [1, 4, 5, 8]
Node 4 is connected to [3, 9]
Node 5 is connected to [2, 3, 6, 7]
Node 6 is connected to [0, 1, 5]
Node 7 is connected to [2, 5, 9]
Node 8 is connected to [3]
Node 9 is connected to [1, 4, 7]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 1): Check shared connections: [2, 6] -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 2>
- Edge (0, 2): Check shared connections: [1] -> No triangles formed
- Edge (0, 6): Check shared connections: [1, 5] -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (1, 2): Check shared connections: [0] -> No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 3): Check shared connections: [9] -> No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 6): Check shared connections: [0, 5] -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 6>
- Edge (1, 9): Check shared connections: [3, 4, 7] -> Triangles formed: <1, 3, 9> <1, 4, 9> <1, 7, 9>
- Edge (2, 5): Check shared connections: [1] -> No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 7): Check shared connections: [5] -> No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 4): Check shared connections: [1] -> No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 5): Check shared connections: [2] -> No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 8): Check shared connections: [] -> No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 6): Check shared connections: [0, 1] -> No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 7): Check shared connections: [2] -> No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 9): Check shared connections: [1] -> No triangles formed

The total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 9>.
