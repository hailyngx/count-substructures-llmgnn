Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their connections:

Node 5 is not connected to any other node.
Nodes 5 and 0 have 0 connections.
Nodes 1, 6, 8, and 4 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 3 and 7 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 2 and 9 have the most connections with 4 connections each.

Now, we relabel the nodes based on their number of connections:

Node 5 (0 connections) becomes Node 0.
Nodes 0 and 7 (1 connection) become Nodes 1 and 2.
Nodes 1, 6, 8, and 4 (1 connection) become Nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6.
Nodes 3 and 7 (2 connections) become Nodes 7 and 8.
Nodes 2 and 9 (4 connections) become Nodes 9 and 10.

Now, we identify the triangles formed by shared connections:

- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 10>
- Triangle 3: <0, 9, 10>
- Triangle 4: <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle 5: <2, 8, 9>
- Triangle 6: <2, 8, 10>
- Triangle 7: <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle 8: <3, 7, 9>
- Triangle 9: <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle 10: <9, 7, 8>

Thus, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
