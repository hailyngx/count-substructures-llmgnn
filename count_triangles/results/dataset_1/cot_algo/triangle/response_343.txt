Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's assign labels to each node based on their number of connections:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we will list the edges in ascending order based on the labels:

(1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

1. For edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
2. For edge (1, 9): No triangle formed.
3. For edge (2, 3): Triangle <2, 3, 6>.
4. For edge (2, 6): No triangle formed.
5. For edge (0, 5): Triangle <0, 3, 5>.
6. For edge (0, 8): No triangle formed.
7. For edge (3, 2): Already counted in step 3.
8. For edge (3, 5): Already counted in step 5.
9. For edge (3, 6): Triangle <2, 3, 6>.
10. For edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
11. For edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.
12. For edge (4, 6): Triangle <2, 4, 6>.
13. For edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.
14. For edge (5, 0): Already counted in step 5.
15. For edge (5, 3): Already counted in step 5.
16. For edge (5, 4): Already counted in step 12.
17. For edge (6, 2): Already counted in step 3 and step 9.
18. For edge (6, 3): Already counted in step 3 and step 9.
19. For edge (6, 4): Already counted in step 12.
20. For edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
21. For edge (7, 4): No triangle formed.
22. For edge (8, 0): No triangle formed.
23. For edge (8, 3): No triangle formed.
24. For edge (8, 9): No triangle formed.
25. For edge (9, 1): No triangle formed.
26. For edge (9, 8): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>
