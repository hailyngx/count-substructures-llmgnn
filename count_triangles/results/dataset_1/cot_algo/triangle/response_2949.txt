Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 6
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 2

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles by examining the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Considering edge (0, 3) where 0 is connected to 3, and they are labeled with fewer connections. Node 0 and node 3 share a connection with node 7, forming a triangle <0, 3, 7>.
- Moving on to edge (0, 4), nodes 0 and 4 share a connection with nodes 7 and 8, forming two triangles <0, 4, 7> and <0, 4, 8>.
- In edge (0, 7), nodes 0 and 7 share a connection with nodes 3, 4, and 8, forming three triangles: <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 4>, and <0, 7, 8>.
- In edge (0, 8), nodes 0 and 8 share a connection with nodes 4 and 7, forming a triangle <0, 8, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 7, and they are:
<0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 4> 

So, the output is [7].
