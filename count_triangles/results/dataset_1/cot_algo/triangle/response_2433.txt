Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 3: 0 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 6: 6 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 7: 7 connections

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph. The total number of triangles is [2].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 4, 6> and <1, 5, 8>.
