Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:  
Node 3 has 4 connections  
Node 8 has 1 connection  
Node 0 has 4 connections  
Node 2 has 2 connections  
Node 6 has 3 connections  
Node 1 has 4 connections  
Node 9 has 4 connections  
Node 7 has 2 connections  
Node 5 has 6 connections  
Node 4 has 5 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

We find the following triangles:  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 5, 6>  
<1, 3, 5>  
<1, 4, 5>  
<4, 6, 9>  
<4, 5, 7>  
<5, 7, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
