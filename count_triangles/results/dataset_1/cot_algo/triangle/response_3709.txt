Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by relabeling the vertices based on the number of connections they have:

Vertex 0 has 4 connections.
Vertex 1 has 2 connections.
Vertex 2 has 3 connections.
Vertex 3 has 3 connections.
Vertex 4 has 3 connections.
Vertex 5 has 5 connections.
Vertex 6 has 1 connection.
Vertex 7 has 5 connections.
Vertex 8 has 4 connections.
Vertex 9 has 1 connection.

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 7 <0, 3, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 6): No triangles.
3. Edge (0, 7): No triangles.
4. Edge (0, 8): Forms a triangle with vertex 5 <0, 5, 8>.
5. Edge (1, 2): No triangles.
6. Edge (1, 8): No triangles.
7. Edge (2, 1): No triangles.
8. Edge (2, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 8 <2, 5, 8>.
9. Edge (2, 8): Forms a triangle with vertex 5 <2, 5, 8>.
10. Edge (3, 0): Forms a triangle with vertex 7 <0, 3, 7>.
11. Edge (3, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 7 <3, 5, 7>.
12. Edge (3, 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 0 <0, 3, 7>.
13. Edge (4, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 7 <4, 5, 7>.
14. Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 5 <4, 5, 7>.
15. Edge (4, 9): No triangles.
16. Edge (5, 2): Forms a triangle with vertex 8 <2, 5, 8>.
17. Edge (5, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 7 <3, 5, 7>.
18. Edge (5, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 7 <4, 5, 7>.
19. Edge (5, 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 4 <4, 5, 7>.
20. Edge (5, 8): No triangles.
21. Edge (6, 0): No triangles.
22. Edge (7, 0): Forms a triangle with vertex 3 <0, 3, 7>.
23. Edge (7, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 0 <0, 3, 7>.
24. Edge (7, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 5 <4, 5, 7>.
25. Edge (7, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 4 <4, 5, 7>.
26. Edge (8, 0): Forms a triangle with vertex 5 <0, 5, 8>.
27. Edge (8, 1): No triangles.
28. Edge (8, 2): Forms a triangle with vertex 5 <2, 5, 8>.
29. Edge (8, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 7 <5, 7, 8>.
