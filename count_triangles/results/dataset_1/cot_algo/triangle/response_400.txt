Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes by their number of connections, we have:
Nodes in increasing order of connections: [5, 7, 0, 2, 7, 1, 6, 8, 3, 6]

After relabelling the nodes, the edges to consider are:
(0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (4, 7) (5, 8)

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. For edge (0, 6): Shared connection with 9 forms <0, 6, 9>.
2. For edge (0, 9): Shared connection with 6 forms <0, 6, 9>.
3. For edge (1, 4): Shared connection with 6 forms <1, 4, 6>.
4. For edge (1, 6): No triangles.
5. For edge (2, 3): No triangles.
6. For edge (2, 9): No triangles.
7. For edge (4, 7): No triangles.
8. For edge (5, 8): No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 6>
