Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabelling them accordingly, the new graph is as follows:
Nodes: 3, 4, 7, 0, 8, 5, 6, 2, 9, 1
Edges: (3, 1) (3, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (9, 1)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>
