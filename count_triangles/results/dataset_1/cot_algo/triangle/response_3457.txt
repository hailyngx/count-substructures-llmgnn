Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 2 has 0 connections.  
Vertex 1 has 2 connections.  
Vertices 3, 5, and 9 have 3 connections.  
Vertices 4, 6, and 8 have 4 connections.  
Vertex 0 has 5 connections.  
Vertices 7 has 6 connections.  

Now we need to count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:  

The triangles found in the graph are:  
<0, 6, 8>  
<0, 6, 4>  

Thus, the total number of triangles is [2].
