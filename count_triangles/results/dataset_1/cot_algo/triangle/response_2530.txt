Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degree, we have the following labeling: <0, 7, 4, 5, 3, 8, 1, 6, 2, 9>.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and identifying triangles, we find the following triangles: 

<0, 2, 1>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 0, 1>
<3, 1, 5>
<6, 1, 3>
<6, 1, 5>
<6, 1, 9>
<8, 2, 0>
<8, 2, 1>
<9, 8, 2>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
