Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
- Node 7 with 0 connections
- Node 6 with 1 connection
- Nodes 2 and 8 with 2 connections
- Nodes 1 and 5 with 3 connections
- Nodes 3 and 9 with 4 connections
- Nodes 0 and 4 with 5 connections

Using the degree-based ordering method to count triangles, we can find the following results:
- Triangle <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle <2, 5, 3>
- Triangle <0, 4, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
