Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we relabel them as follows: 
Node 1 (degree 4) → Node 0  
Node 6 (degree 1) → Node 1  
Node 2 (degree 3) → Node 2  
Node 8 (degree 4) → Node 3  
Node 3 (degree 3) → Node 4  
Node 7 (degree 3) → Node 5  
Node 9 (degree 5) → Node 6  
Node 4 (degree 3) → Node 7  
Node 5 (degree 4) → Node 8  
Node 0 (degree 5) → Node 9  

Now, we will count the triangles:

Looking at the edges, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
The triangles formed are <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, and <7, 9, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
