Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new vertex order is as follows: 
Vertices: 1, 0, 9, 5, 2, 8, 7, 4, 6, 3

Now, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph: 
- Edge (1, 6) is skipped since 1 has fewer connections than 6.
- Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <0, 3, 6>.
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <3, 4, 6>.
- Edge (3, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <3, 6, 4>.
- Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <4, 7, 5>.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, and <4, 7, 5>.
