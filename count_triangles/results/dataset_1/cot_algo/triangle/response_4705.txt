Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
    0: 5, 6
    1: 7, 9
    2: 5, 6
    3: 6, 7
    5: 0, 2
    6: 0, 2, 3
    7: 1, 3
    9: 1

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
    Vertices by degree: 9 < 0 < 1 < 3 < 7 < 2 < 5 < 6

Triangles found:
    <2, 3, 6>

Total number of triangles: [1]
