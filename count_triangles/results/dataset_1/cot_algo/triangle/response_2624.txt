Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degrees:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 7 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 0 (2 connections) -> Node 7 (lowest degree)
Node 1 (4 connections) -> Node 4
Node 2 (3 connections) -> Node 3
Node 3 (4 connections) -> Node 5
Node 4 (2 connections) -> Node 0
Node 5 (3 connections) -> Node 2
Node 6 (3 connections) -> Node 1
Node 7 (1 connection) -> Node 8
Node 8 (7 connections) -> Node 6 (highest degree)
Node 9 (1 connection) -> Node 9

Now, let's analyze the edges based on the relabeled nodes:

Edges to consider following the order of nodes:
(1, 4) - Node 1 (4 connections) has more connections than Node 4 (2 connections), continuing
(3, 5) - Node 3 (4 connections) has more connections than Node 5 (3 connections), continuing
(1, 6) - Node 1 (4 connections) has more connections than Node 6 (3 connections), continuing
(4, 0) - Node 4 (2 connections) has fewer connections than Node 0 (2 connections), skipping
(6, 3) - Node 6 (3 connections) has more connections than Node 3 (4 connections), continuing
(6, 1) - Node 6 (3 connections) has fewer connections than Node 1 (4 connections), forming a triangle: <1, 6, 3>
(8, 7) - Node 8 (7 connections) has more connections than Node 7 (1 connection), continuing
(8, 6) - Node 8 (7 connections) has more connections than Node 6 (3 connections), continuing
(8, 8) - Node 8 (7 connections) has more connections than Node 8 itself, forming a triangle: <8, 6, 8>
(8, 9) - Node 8 (7 connections) has more connections than Node 9 (1 connection), skipping

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 2, and the unique triangles found are <1, 6, 3> and <8, 6, 8>. 

So, the output should be [2].
