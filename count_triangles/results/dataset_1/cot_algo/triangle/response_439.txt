Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 0: 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we proceed with the given edges:
1. (0, 3): No triangles
2. (0, 7): No triangles
3. (0, 8): Form triangle <0, 7, 8>
4. (0, 9): Form triangle <0, 7, 9>
5. (1, 4): No triangles
6. (1, 7): No triangles
7. (2, 8): No triangles
8. (2, 9): No triangles
9. (3, 0): No triangles
10. (3, 7): No triangles
11. (4, 1): No triangles
12. (4, 9): No triangles
13. (5, 6): No triangles
14. (5, 8): No triangles
15. (6, 5): No triangles
16. (6, 9): No triangles
17. (7, 0): No triangles
18. (7, 1): No triangles
19. (7, 3): No triangles
20. (7, 8): Form triangle <7, 0, 8>
21. (8, 0): No triangles
22. (8, 2): No triangles
23. (8, 5): No triangles
24. (8, 7): Form triangle <8, 0, 7>
25. (9, 0): Form triangle <9, 0, 7>
26. (9, 2): No triangles
27. (9, 4): No triangles
28. (9, 6): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <7, 0, 8>, <8, 0, 7>, <9, 0, 7>
