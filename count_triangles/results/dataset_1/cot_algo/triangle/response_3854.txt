Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices and their degrees are as follows:
- 0: degree 3
- 1: degree 4
- 2: degree 4
- 3: degree 3
- 4: degree 1
- 5: degree 2
- 6: degree 2
- 7: degree 4
- 8: degree 5
- 9: degree 3

We will sort the vertices based on their degrees and relabel them as follows:
- 4: 0
- 5: 1
- 6: 2
- 0: 3
- 3: 4
- 9: 5
- 1: 6
- 2: 7
- 7: 8
- 8: 9

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Triangle formed with 0, 2, 3
2. Edge (0, 3): Triangle formed with 0, 2, 3
3. Edge (0, 9): No additional triangle
4. Edge (1, 3): No additional triangle
5. Edge (1, 5): No additional triangle
6. Edge (1, 6): No additional triangle
7. Edge (1, 8): Triangle formed with 1, 2, 8
8. Edge (2, 0): Triangle formed with 0, 2, 3
9. Edge (2, 5): No additional triangle
10. Edge (2, 7): No additional triangle
11. Edge (2, 8): Triangle formed with 1, 2, 8
12. Edge (3, 0): Triangle counted in edge (0, 2)
13. Edge (3, 1): No additional triangle
14. Edge (3, 7): No additional triangle
15. Edge (4, 8): No additional triangle
16. Edge (5, 1): No additional triangle
17. Edge (5, 2): No additional triangle
18. Edge (6, 1): No additional triangle
19. Edge (6, 9): No additional triangle
20. Edge (7, 2): No additional triangle
21. Edge (7, 3): No additional triangle
22. Edge (7, 8): No additional triangle
23. Edge (7, 9): No additional triangle
24. Edge (8, 1): Triangle counted in edge (1, 8)
25. Edge (8, 2): Triangle counted in edge (2, 8)
26. Edge (8, 4): No additional triangle
27. Edge (8, 7): No additional triangle
28. Edge (9, 0): No additional triangle
29. Edge (9, 6): No additional triangle
30. Edge (9, 7): No additional triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 8>.
