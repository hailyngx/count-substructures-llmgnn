Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex based on the given edges:
- Vertex 0 is connected to 1 vertex.
- Vertex 1 is connected to 3 vertices.
- Vertex 2 is connected to 5 vertices.
- Vertex 3 is connected to 4 vertices.
- Vertex 4 is connected to 4 vertices.
- Vertex 5 is connected to 4 vertices.
- Vertex 6 is connected to 1 vertex.
- Vertex 7 is connected to 6 vertices.
- Vertex 8 is connected to 1 vertex.
- Vertex 9 is connected to 4 vertices.

Now, we reorder the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices by degree: 0, 6, 8, 3, 4, 5, 9, 1, 7, 2

Now, we count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: [<1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [5]
