Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each vertex (number of connections):

- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:

- Node 2: degree 1 -> A
- Node 3: degree 1 -> B
- Node 5: degree 2 -> C
- Node 6: degree 2 -> D
- Node 8: degree 2 -> E
- Node 1: degree 3 -> F
- Node 4: degree 3 -> G
- Node 7: degree 3 -> H
- Node 9: degree 4 -> I

Next, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

1. (A, H): No triangle
2. (B, G): No triangle
3. (C, F): Triangle <1, 5, 7>
4. (D, H): No triangle
5. (E, F): Triangle <1, 4, 8>
6. (F, E): No triangle
7. (F, G): Triangle <1, 4, 9>
8. (F, I): No triangle
9. (C, H): Triangle <1, 5, 7>
10. (D, I): No triangle
11. (E, D): No triangle
12. (H, I): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
- <1, 5, 7>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 9>
