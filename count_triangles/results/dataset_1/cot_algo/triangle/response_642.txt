Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following order: 
Vertices: 3, 9, 6, 0, 1, 5, 2, 8, 7, 4.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 4): Shared connections with vertex 0 and 4 are 2 and 1, forming triangles {0, 4, 2} and {0, 4, 1}.
2. Edge (1, 4): Shared connection with vertex 1 and 4 is 2, forming triangle {1, 4, 2}.
3. Edge (1, 8): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (2, 4): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (2, 6): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (3, 7): Shared connections with vertex 3 and 7 are 8 and 5, forming triangle {3, 7, 8} and {3, 7, 5}.
7. Edge (3, 8): Shared connection with vertex 3 and 8 is 7, forming a triangle {3, 8, 7}.
8. Edge (4, 0): Already counted in Edge 1.
9. Edge (4, 1): Already counted in Edge 2.
10. Edge (4, 2): Already counted in Edge 2.
11. Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (4, 7): Shared connections with vertex 4 and 7 are 1 and 8, forming a triangle {4, 7, 1}.
13. Edge (5, 4): Already counted in Edge 1.
14. Edge (5, 7): Already counted in Edge 12.
15. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (6, 2): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (6, 7): Shared connection with vertex 6 and 7 is 9, forming a triangle {6, 7, 9}.
18. Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (7, 3): Already counted in Edge 6.
20. Edge (7, 4): Already counted in Edge 1.
21. Edge (7, 5): Already counted in Edge 12.
22. Edge (7, 6): Already counted in Edge 17.
23. Edge (7, 8): Shared connection with vertex 7 and 8 is 5, forming a triangle {7, 8, 5}.
24. Edge (8, 1): Already counted in Edge 2.
25. Edge (8, 3): Already counted in Edge 6.
26. Edge (8, 5): Already counted in Edge 12.
27. Edge (8, 7): Already counted in Edge 23.
28. Edge (8, 9): No triangle formed.
29. Edge (9, 6): No triangle formed.
30. Edge (9, 8): No triangle formed.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 1>, <1, 4, 2>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 5>, and <6, 7, 9>.
