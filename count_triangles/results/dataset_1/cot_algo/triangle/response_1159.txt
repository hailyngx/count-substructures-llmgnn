Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices based on their degree ordering are: 
- Vertex 0 has degree 5
- Vertex 1 has degree 5
- Vertex 8 has degree 6
- Vertex 4 has degree 4
- Vertex 5 has degree 4
- Vertex 7 has degree 3
- Vertex 2 has degree 2
- Vertex 3 has degree 1
- Vertex 6 has degree 2
- Vertex 9 has degree 2

Counting the number of triangles:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 3: <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle 4: <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle 5: <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle 6: <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle 7: <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle 8: <1, 5, 8>

So the total number of triangles is [8].
