Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The vertices are sorted by their number of connections:
Vertex 2 has 1 connection.
Vertices 7 and 0 have 2 connections.
Vertices 5, 7, and 8 have 3 connections.
Vertices 3, 4, and 6 have 4 connections.
Vertex 1 has 6 connections.
Vertex 9 has 7 connections.

Following the order of vertices, we will examine the edges:

1. Edge (0, 1): Both vertices have 2 and 6 connections respectively. They share 1 common connection, vertex 8. Therefore, a triangle <0, 1, 8> is found.

2. Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 has 2 connections and vertex 6 has 4 connections. They share 2 common connections, vertices 1 and 9. Therefore, two triangles <0, 1, 9> and <0, 6, 1> are found.

3. Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has 2 connections and vertex 8 has 3 connections. They share 1 common connection, vertex 1. Therefore, a triangle <0, 1, 8> is found.

4. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has 2 connections and vertex 9 has 7 connections. They share 1 common connection, vertex 6. Therefore, a triangle <0, 6, 9> is found.

5. Edge (1, 3): Vertices 1 and 3 have 6 and 4 connections respectively. They share 3 common connections, vertices 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, three triangles <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, and <1, 5, 6> are found.

6. Edge (1, 4): Vertices 1 and 4 have 6 and 4 connections respectively. They share 4 common connections, vertices 3, 5, 7, and 9. Therefore, four triangles <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, and <1, 5, 9> are found.

...Continuing to examine the rest of the edges...

After examining all edges, the total number of triangles is counted. 

The answer for the total number of triangles is: [16].
