Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most as follows:

Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections

Since we have 10 nodes in total, we will now count the number of triangles using this method.

There are [13] triangles in the given graph:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
