Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:
Node 4 has degree 1
Nodes 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 have degree 2
Nodes 0, 2 have degree 3
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 5

The sorted vertices are therefore: 4, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 0, 2, 1, 7

Now, starting with the edge (0, 1), we proceed because node 0 has fewer connections than node 1. 
We find that nodes 0, 1, and 2 form a triangle.
Moving to the next edge (0, 2), we also find a triangle with nodes 0, 2, and 3.
Skipping edge (1, 0) since we already considered it.
Moving on to the next edge (1, 7), we find a triangle with nodes 1, 7, and 8.
Skipping edge (1, 8) since we already considered it.
Skipping edge (2, 0) since we already considered it.
Skipping edge (2, 3) as it does not form a triangle with the current ordering.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 3, and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <1, 7, 8>. 

The answer is:
