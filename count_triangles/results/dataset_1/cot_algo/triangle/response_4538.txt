Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labeling of vertices is: 

Node 1: 7 connections
Node 4: 7 connections
Node 9: 7 connections
Node 0: 8 connections
Node 3: 8 connections
Node 6: 8 connections
Node 2: 9 connections
Node 5: 9 connections
Node 8: 9 connections
Node 7: 10 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [14]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 6>
<8, 7, 9>
