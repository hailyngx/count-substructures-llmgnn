Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, the new graph representation is as follows:  
- Vertex 0: connections with vertices 1, 2, 4, 8  
- Vertex 1: connections with vertices 0, 3, 4, 5, 6  
- Vertex 2: connections with vertices 0, 3, 7, 9  
- Vertex 3: connections with vertices 1, 2  
- Vertex 4: connections with vertices 0, 1, 9  
- Vertex 5: connections with vertices 1, 8  
- Vertex 6: connections with vertices 1, 8  
- Vertex 7: connections with vertex 2  
- Vertex 8: connections with vertices 0, 5, 6, 9  
- Vertex 9: connections with vertices 2, 4, 8  

Counting the triangles according to the Degree-Based Ordering method yields:
\[ [5] \]

The unique triangles found are:
\[ <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 8> \]
