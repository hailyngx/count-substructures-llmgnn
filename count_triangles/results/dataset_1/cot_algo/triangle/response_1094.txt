Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most connected, we get the following relabeling: 

Nodes: 5, 1, 6, 3, 0, 8, 7, 9, 2, 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [52]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
