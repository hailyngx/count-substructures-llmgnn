Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labels are: 3, 5, 1, 8, 9, 6, 2, 7, 4, 0. 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph: 

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 4>
<2, 6, 0>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
