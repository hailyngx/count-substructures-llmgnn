Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling will be: 

Node 2 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 1 connection.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.
Node 8 has 6 connections.
Node 9 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering approach, we will now count the triangles in the graph. 

Triangles found: 
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 8, 4>
<4, 8, 9> 

Total number of triangles: [10]
