Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

For the edge (0, 2):
Node 0 and Node 2 have 3 shared connections: 5, 7, 6. Therefore, there is a triangle <0, 2, 6>.

For the edge (0, 5):
Node 0 and Node 5 do not have any shared connections.

For the edge (0, 7):
Node 0 and Node 7 have 1 shared connection: 9. Therefore, there is a triangle <0, 7, 9>.

For the edge (1, 3):
Node 1 and Node 3 do not have any shared connections.

For the edge (1, 7):
Node 1 and Node 7 do not have any shared connections.

For the edge (2, 4):
Node 2 and Node 4 have 3 shared connections: 6, 9, 7. Therefore, there is a triangle <2, 4, 6>.

For the edge (2, 6):
Node 2 and Node 6 have 1 shared connection: 4. Therefore, there is a triangle <2, 4, 6>.

For the edge (3, 1):
Node 3 and Node 1 do not have any shared connections.

For the edge (4, 2):
Node 4 and Node 2 have 3 shared connections: 6, 9, 7. Therefore, there is a triangle <2, 4, 6>.

For the edge (4, 6):
Node 4 and Node 6 have 4 shared connections: 2, 9, 7, 0. Therefore, there is a triangle <0, 4, 6>.

For the edge (4, 8):
Node 4 and Node 8 do not have any shared connections.

For the edge (4, 9):
Node 4 and Node 9 have 2 shared connections: 6, 7. Therefore, there is a triangle <4, 6, 7>.

For the edge (5, 0):
Node 5 and Node 0 do not have any shared connections.

For the edge (6, 2):
Node 6 and Node 2 have 1 shared connection: 4. Therefore, there is a triangle <2, 4, 6>.

For the edge (6, 4):
Node 6 and Node 4 have 4 shared connections: 2, 9, 7, 0. Therefore, there is a triangle <0, 4, 6>.

For the edge (7, 0):
Node 7 and Node 0 have 1 shared connection: 9. Therefore, there is a triangle <0, 7, 9>.

For the edge (7, 1):
Node 7 and Node 1 do not have any shared connections.

For the edge (7, 9):
Node 7 and Node 9 have 2 shared connections: 0, 4. Therefore, there is a triangle <0, 7, 4>.

For the edge (8, 4):
Node 8 and Node 4 do not have any shared connections.

For the edge (9, 4):
Node 9 and Node 4 have 2 shared connections: 6, 7. Therefore, there is a triangle <4, 6, 7>.

For the edge (9, 7):
Node 9 and Node 7 have 2 shared connections: 0, 4. Therefore, there is a triangle <0, 7, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
