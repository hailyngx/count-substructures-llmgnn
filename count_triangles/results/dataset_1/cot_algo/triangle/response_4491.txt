Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Vertex 9: Degree 1
Vertex 2: Degree 1
Vertex 1: Degree 2
Vertex 4: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 3
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 5
Vertex 7: Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles present in the graph.

There are 5 triangles in total: [<0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>].

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
