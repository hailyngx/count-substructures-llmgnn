Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 1
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 9: degree 3

Using the degree-based ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles: 

1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <0, 6, 4>
4. <0, 6, 9>
5. <3, 8, 9>
6. <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
