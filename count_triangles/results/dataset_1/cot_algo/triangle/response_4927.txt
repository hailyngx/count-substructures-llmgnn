Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 0 has 1 connection
Node 1 has 3 connections
Node 2 has 2 connections
Node 4 has 1 connection
Node 7 has 2 connections
Node 9 has 2 connections
Node 3 has 4 connections
Node 5 has 2 connections
Node 6 has 3 connections
Node 8 has 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:
- Triangle 1: <1, 4, 3>
- Triangle 2: <1, 2, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
