Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabel the vertices accordingly. 

The sorted vertices with their degrees are:
Vertex 7 - Degree: 5
Vertex 0 - Degree: 5
Vertex 6 - Degree: 5
Vertex 1 - Degree: 5
Vertex 2 - Degree: 4
Vertex 4 - Degree: 3
Vertex 9 - Degree: 3
Vertex 3 - Degree: 2
Vertex 5 - Degree: 2
Vertex 8 - Degree: 2

Now, we will count the number of triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Starting with the edge (0, 2):
   Vertex 2 has degree 4 and vertex 0 has degree 5, so the condition is met.
   Checking for shared connections between vertices 0 and 2, we find that they share vertex 5.
   Therefore, the triangle <0, 2, 5> is formed.

2. Moving on to the edge (0, 4):
   Vertex 4 has degree 3 and vertex 0 has degree 5, so the condition is met.
   Checking for shared connections between vertices 0 and 4, we find that they share vertex 6.
   Therefore, the triangle <0, 4, 6> is formed.

3. Continuing this process for all edges, we find the following triangles:
   <0, 2, 5>
   <0, 4, 6>
   <0, 6, 7>
   <0, 6, 5>
   <0, 7, 1>
   <0, 7, 3>
   <0, 7, 9>
   <1, 4, 6>
   <1, 6, 7>
   <2, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
