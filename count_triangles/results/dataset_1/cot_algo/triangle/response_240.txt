Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes by their degree:
- Node 6 has 0 connections
- Nodes 1 and 9 have 1 connection each
- Nodes 3 and 9 have 2 connections each
- Nodes 5 and 7 have 3 connections each
- Nodes 0 and 4 have 4 connections each
- Node 2 has 5 connections
- Node 8 has 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 share nodes 3 and 7. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 7): Node 0 and 7 share nodes 3 and 8. Triangles formed: <0, 3, 7> and <0, 5, 7>.
3. Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (2, 1): No triangles formed (already counted).
5. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 and 4 share node 8. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>.
6. Edge (2, 8): Nodes 2 and 8 share nodes 4 and 7. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>.
7. Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (3, 7): Nodes 3 and 7 share nodes 0 and 8. Triangle formed: <3, 0, 7>.
9. Edge (4, 2): No triangles formed (already counted).
10. Edge (4, 8): No triangles formed (already counted).
11. Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (5, 0): No triangles formed (already counted).
13. Edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (7, 0): No triangles formed.
15. Edge (7, 3): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (7, 8): Nodes 7 and 8 share nodes 0 and 2. Triangle formed: <7, 0, 8>.
17. Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed (already counted).
18. Edge (8, 4): No triangles formed (already counted).
19. Edge (8, 7): No triangles formed (already counted).
20. Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.

The total number of triangles is [5] inside brackets.
