Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 5: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 2: degree 6
Node 6: degree 7

Examining each edge starting from the vertex with the lower label:
- Edge (0, 2): Forms a triangle with node 6
- Edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle with nodes 1, 6
- Edge (0, 6): Forms triangles with nodes 2, 4, 9
- Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 4): Forms a triangle with node 6
- Edge (1, 6): Forms triangles with nodes 0, 4, 9
- Edge (2, 0): Forms a triangle with node 6
- Edge (2, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 6): Forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, 4, 9
- Edge (2, 8): Forms a triangle with node 7
- Edge (2, 9): Forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, 6
- Edge (3, 1): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 6): Forms a triangle with node 2
- Edge (3, 8): Forms a triangle with node 6
- Edge (3, 9): Forms a triangle with node 2
- Edge (4, 0): Forms a triangle with nodes 1, 6
- Edge (4, 1): Forms a triangle with node 6
- Edge (4, 6): Forms triangles with nodes 0, 1, 9
- Edge (5, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (6, 0): Forms triangles with nodes 1, 4, 9
- Edge (6, 1): Forms a triangle with node 4
- Edge (6, 2): Forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, 4, 9
- Edge (6, 3): Forms a triangle with node 2
- Edge (6, 4): Forms triangles with nodes 0, 1, 9
- Edge (6, 7): Forms a triangle with node 2
- Edge (6, 9): Forms triangles with nodes 0, 1, 2, 4
- Edge (7, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 6): Forms a triangle with node 2
- Edge (7, 8): Forms a triangle with node 2
- Edge (8, 2): Forms a triangle with node 7
- Edge (8, 3): Forms a triangle with node 6
- Edge (8, 7): Forms a triangle with node 2
- Edge (9, 2): Forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, 6
- Edge (9, 3): Forms a triangle with node 2
- Edge (9, 4): Forms triangles with nodes 0, 6
- Edge (9, 6): Forms triangles with nodes 0, 1, 2, 4
