Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following relabeled graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Connections for each node:
0: 5 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 5 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 3 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle 4: <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle 5: <2, 3, 7>
- Triangle 6: <3, 5, 7>
- Triangle 7: <4, 0, 5>
- Triangle 8: <4, 1, 7>
- Triangle 9: <5, 0, 7>
- Triangle 10: <6, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
