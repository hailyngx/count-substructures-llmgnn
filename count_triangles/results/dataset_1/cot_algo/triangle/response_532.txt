Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows: 
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 9: 1 connection

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles. The triangles found in this graph are: 
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
