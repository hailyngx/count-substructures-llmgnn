Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to relabel the vertices based on their degree of connections:

- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 1 has degree 2
- Vertex 2 has degree 2
- Vertex 3 has degree 1
- Vertex 4 has degree 4
- Vertex 5 has degree 4
- Vertex 6 has degree 2
- Vertex 7 has degree 4
- Vertex 8 has degree 3
- Vertex 9 has degree 4

The vertices in ascending order of degrees are: 3, 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 5, 9, 7, 4.

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For the edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 is labeled lower and has fewer connections. Vertex 0 and Vertex 4 share a connection with Vertex 7, forming the triangle <0, 4, 7>.
- For the edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 is labeled lower and has fewer connections. Vertex 0 and Vertex 7 do not form a triangle with shared connections.
- For the edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 is labeled lower and has fewer connections. Vertex 1 and Vertex 5 share a connection with Vertex 6, forming the triangle <1, 5, 6>.
- For the edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 is labeled lower and has fewer connections. Vertex 1 and Vertex 6 do not form a triangle with shared connections.
- For the edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 is labeled lower and has fewer connections. Vertex 2 and Vertex 7 do not form a triangle with shared connections.
- For the remaining edges, no triangles are formed based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7> and <1, 5, 6>.
