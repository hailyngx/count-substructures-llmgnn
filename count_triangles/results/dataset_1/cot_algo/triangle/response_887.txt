Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees is as follows:

Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 1
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 4: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (2, 3): No triangle
2. (2, 5): No triangle
3. (6, 1): No triangle
4. (0, 1): Vertex 0 shares a connection with vertices 1 and 5 forming a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
5. (0, 5): No triangle
6. (9, 0): Vertex 9 has connections with vertices 0 and 5 forming a triangle <0, 5, 9>.
7. (1, 0): Already counted in step 4
8. (3, 1): Already counted in step 4
9. (4, 3): No triangle
10. (7, 3): Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 4 and 8 forming a triangle <3, 4, 8>.
11. (7, 8): No triangle
12. (9, 4): Already counted in step 9
13. (3, 8): Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 4 and 5 forming a triangle <3, 4, 5>.
14. (3, 2): No triangle
15. (8, 7): Already counted in step 10
16. (8, 1): Vertex 1 shares a connection with vertices 3 and 5 forming a triangle <1, 3, 5>.
17. (9, 7): Already counted in step 10
18. (5, 0): Already counted in step 4
19. (5, 1): Already counted in step 16
20. (5, 4): Already counted in step 13
21. (5, 9): Already counted in step 6

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, and <1, 3, 5>.
