Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the relabeled vertices are: 6, 5, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 7, 9, 8.

The edges that meet the criteria (lower labeled vertex having fewer connections) are: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (7, 9), (8, 9).

By checking for shared connections, the total number of triangles is [7].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <4, 5, 6>, <8, 9, 7>, <8, 9, 1>.
