Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of vertices sorted by the number of connections:

Nodes: 
5 - degree: 3 
6 - degree: 3 
2 - degree: 3 
3 - degree: 3 
0 - degree: 2 
1 - degree: 2 
7 - degree: 2 
8 - degree: 2 
4 - degree: 1

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:

Nodes: 
4 - degree: 1 
0 - degree: 2 
1 - degree: 2 
7 - degree: 2 
8 - degree: 2 
5 - degree: 3 
6 - degree: 3 
2 - degree: 3 
3 - degree: 3

Next, we will check each edge starting from the vertex with the lower label and count the number of triangles formed:

Triangles: 
[15]
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 7, 4>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 6, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 1>
<2, 6, 5>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 6, 2>
<3, 6, 5>
<8, 3, 6>
