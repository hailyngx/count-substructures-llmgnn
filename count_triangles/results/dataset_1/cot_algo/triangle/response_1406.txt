Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. 

The degrees of each vertex in the graph are as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 1
- Vertex 6: degree 5
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 2

Sorting the vertices based on their degrees in increasing order, we get:
Vertices: 3, 5, 7, 1, 2, 4, 9, 8, 0, 6

Now, we go through each edge in the graph based on this ordering and count the number of triangles:
1. Edge (3, 5): No triangles
2. Edge (5, 7): No triangles
3. Edge (7, 1): No triangles
4. Edge (1, 6): No triangles
5. Edge (2, 6): No triangles
6. Edge (4, 2): Triangle formed <2, 4, 6>
7. Edge (9, 4): No triangles
8. Edge (8, 0): Triangle formed <0, 4, 8>
9. Edge (0, 6): No triangles
10. Edge (8, 1): No triangles
11. Edge (8, 6): Triangle formed <6, 8, 0>
12. Edge (2, 6): Triangle formed <2, 6, 4>
13. Edge (6, 1): No triangles
14. Edge (9, 7): No triangles
15. Edge (1, 8): No triangles
16. Edge (6, 0): No triangles
17. Edge (6, 9): No triangles

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <2, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <6, 8, 0>.
