Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new label for each vertex is as follows:
- Node 4: Degree 1
- Node 8: Degree 1
- Node 5: Degree 2
- Node 6: Degree 2
- Node 9: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 5

Using the degree-based ordering method to count the triangles:

1. (1, 5) - No triangles
2. (1, 6) - No triangles
3. (1, 7) - No triangles
4. (1, 9) - No triangles
5. (5, 6) - No triangles
6. (0, 2) - No triangles
7. (0, 7) - No triangles
8. (0, 9) - No triangles
9. (2, 9) - Triangle <0, 2, 9>
10. (3, 2) - No triangles
11. (3, 7) - No triangles
12. (3, 8) - No triangles
13. (7, 4) - No triangles

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>.
