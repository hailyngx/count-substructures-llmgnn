Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
- Node 2 has 2 connections
- Node 5 has 2 connections
- Node 1 has 3 connections
- Node 6 has 3 connections
- Node 4 has 4 connections
- Node 9 has 4 connections
- Node 7 has 5 connections
- Node 0 has 6 connections
- Node 3 has 7 connections
- Node 8 has 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles present in the graph.

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 9>
