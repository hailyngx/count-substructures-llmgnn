Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 5
- Node 1: degree = 4
- Node 2: degree = 3
- Node 3: degree = 2
- Node 4: degree = 3
- Node 5: degree = 1
- Node 6: degree = 4
- Node 7: degree = 2
- Node 8: degree = 2

Now, we'll relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 5 (degree 1) -> A
- Nodes 3, 7, 8 (degree 2) -> B, C, D (in any order)
- Nodes 2, 4 (degree 3) -> E, F (in any order)
- Nodes 1, 6 (degree 4) -> G, H (in any order)
- Node 0 (degree 5) -> I

The edges in the graph can now be represented as:
(I, G) (I, B) (I, F) (I, H) (I, C)
(G, I) (G, E) (G, B) (G, H)
(E, G) (E, F) (E, D)
(B, I) (B, G)
(F, I) (F, E) (F, H)
(A, D)
(H, I) (H, G) (H, F) (H, C)
(C, I) (C, H)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle <I, G, H>
- Triangle <G, F, E> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
