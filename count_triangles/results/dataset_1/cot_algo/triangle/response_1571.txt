Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 
0(1), 7(1), 4(2), 5(2), 7(2), 3(3), 6(3), 8(4), 1(5), 2(5).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

As we go through each edge considering the vertex with lower label having fewer connections, we find the following unique triangles:
<1, 0, 2>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <3, 2, 5>, <3, 2, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 2, 8>, <6, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
