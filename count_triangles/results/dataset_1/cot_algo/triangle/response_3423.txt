Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling will be:  
Node 7: degree 1  
Node 1: degree 1  
Node 4: degree 1  
Node 8: degree 2  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 4  
Node 0: degree 5  
Node 2: degree 5  
Node 9: degree 6 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we look at each edge in the order they are given:

1. (0, 2) - Node 0 and Node 2 form a triangle with Node 9: <0, 2, 9>
2. (0, 3) - No triangles formed
3. (0, 9) - No triangles formed
4. (1, 5) - No triangles formed
5. (2, 0) - Already counted
6. (2, 8) - No triangles formed
7. (2, 9) - Already counted
8. (3, 0) - No triangles formed
9. (3, 5) - No triangles formed
10. (3, 9) - Node 3 and Node 9 form a triangle with Node 5: <3, 5, 9>
11. (4, 6) - No triangles formed
12. (5, 1) - No triangles formed
13. (5, 3) - Already counted
14. (5, 6) - Node 5 and Node 6 form a triangle with Node 9: <5, 6, 9>
15. (5, 8) - No triangles formed
16. (6, 4) - No triangles formed
17. (6, 5) - Already counted
18. (6, 9) - Already counted
19. (7, 9) - No triangles formed
20. (8, 2) - Already counted
21. (8, 5) - No triangles formed
22. (9, 0) - Already counted
23. (9, 2) - Already counted
24. (9, 3) - Already counted
25. (9, 6) - Already counted
26. (9, 7) - No triangles formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9> and <3, 5, 9>.
