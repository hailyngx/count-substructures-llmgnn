Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes by their degree, we have:
Nodes 2 and 9 have degree 2,
Nodes 1, 6, and 8 have degree 3,
Nodes 3 and 7 have degree 4,
Nodes 0 and 5 have degree 5, and
Node 4 has degree 6.

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:
For edge (0, 1): No triangle.
For edge (0, 4): Triangle <0, 4, 7>.
For edge (0, 5): Triangle <0, 4, 5>.
For edge (0, 7): No triangle.
For edge (1, 5): No triangle.
For edge (1, 8): No triangle.
For edge (2, 4): No triangle.
For edge (3, 4): No triangle.
For edge (3, 6): No triangle.
For edge (3, 8): No triangle.
For edge (4, 5): Triangle <0, 4, 5>.
For edge (4, 6): Triangle <3, 4, 6>.
For edge (4, 7): Triangle <0, 4, 7>.
For edge (4, 8): No triangle.
For edge (5, 8): No triangle.
For edge (5, 9): No triangle.
For edge (7, 8): No triangle.
For edge (7, 9): No triangle.

Total number of triangles in the graph: [3]
Triangles found: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>.
