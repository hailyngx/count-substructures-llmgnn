Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices: 2, 5, 7, 0, 8, 9, 5, 1, 4, 3
Connections: 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4

Next, we relabel the vertices:
0 -> 0 (degree: 2)
1 -> 1 (degree: 4)
3 -> 2 (degree: 4)
4 -> 3 (degree: 4)
6 -> 4 (degree: 2)
8 -> 5 (degree: 0)
9 -> 6 (degree: 2)

Now we will analyze each edge following the rules provided. 

For the edge (0, 1):
Vertex 0 and 1 have 2 shared connections at vertices 8 and 6 forming triangle <0, 1, 6>.

For the edge (0, 8):
Vertex 0 and 8 do not create a triangle.

For the edge (1, 3):
Vertex 1 and 3 have 1 shared connection at vertex 6 forming triangle <1, 3, 6>.

For the edge (1, 6):
Vertex 1 and 6 have 1 shared connection at vertex 3 forming triangle <1, 6, 3>.

For the edge (3, 4):
Vertex 3 and 4 have 2 shared connections at vertices 1 and 6 forming triangles <3, 4, 1> and <3, 4, 6>.

For the edge (3, 9):
Vertex 3 and 9 do not create a triangle.

For the edge (4, 6):
Vertex 4 and 6 have 1 shared connection at vertex 3 forming triangle <4, 6, 3>.
 
Finally, we count the total number of triangles: 
Total triangles: [5]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 3>.
