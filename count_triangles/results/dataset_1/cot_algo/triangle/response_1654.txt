Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:
Nodes: 5, 6, 7, 1, 3, 2, 8, 9, 4

The triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 4>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 1>
<4, 8, 3>
<5, 7, 9>
<8, 1, 3>
<8, 1, 9>
<8, 3, 1>
<9, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
