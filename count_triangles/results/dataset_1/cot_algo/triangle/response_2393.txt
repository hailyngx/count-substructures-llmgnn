Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections they have:

Vertex 0 has degree 1
Vertex 1 has degree 2
Vertex 5 has degree 2
Vertex 8 has degree 3
Vertex 3 has degree 4
Vertex 6 has degree 4
Vertex 9 has degree 4
Vertex 4 has degree 5
Vertex 7 has degree 6
Vertex 2 has degree 7

Relabeling the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 0 (degree 1) --> relabel as 0
Vertex 1 (degree 2) --> relabel as 1
Vertex 5 (degree 2) --> relabel as 2
Vertex 8 (degree 3) --> relabel as 3
Vertex 3 (degree 4) --> relabel as 4
Vertex 6 (degree 4) --> relabel as 5
Vertex 9 (degree 4) --> relabel as 6
Vertex 4 (degree 5) --> relabel as 7
Vertex 7 (degree 6) --> relabel as 8
Vertex 2 (degree 7) --> relabel as 9

Now, we will iterate through the edges to count the triangles:

Triangles:
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [10]
