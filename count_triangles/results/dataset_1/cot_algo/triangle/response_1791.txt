Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, we have the following order: 

Node 5 < Node 1 < Node 8 < Node 6 < Node 1 < Node 0 < Node 7 < Node 9 < Node 4 < Node 3 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles.

1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 have a common neighbor (Node 7), forming a triangle <0, 2, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 7): No triangle is formed.
3. Edge (0, 8): No triangle is formed.
4. Edge (1, 3): No triangle is formed.
5. Edge (2, 0): Already counted in step 1.
6. Edge (2, 3): Node 2 and Node 3 have a common neighbor (Node 7), forming a triangle <2, 3, 7>.
7. Edge (2, 9): No triangle is formed.
8. Edge (3, 1): Already counted in step 4.
9. Edge (3, 2): Already counted in step 6.
10. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 and Node 4 have a common neighbor (Node 7), forming a triangle <3, 4, 7>.
11. Edge (3, 7): No triangle is formed.
12. Edge (4, 3): Already counted in step 10.
13. Edge (4, 7): No triangle is formed.
14. Edge (4, 9): No triangle is formed.
15. Edge (5, 6): No triangle is formed.
16. Edge (6, 5): No triangle is formed.
17. Edge (6, 9): No triangle is formed.
18. Edge (7, 0): Already counted in step 1.
19. Edge (7, 3): Already counted in step 6.
20. Edge (7, 4): Already counted in step 10.
21. Edge (8, 0): No triangle is formed.
22. Edge (9, 2): Already counted in step 6.
23. Edge (9, 4): Already counted in step 10.
24. Edge (9, 6): No triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] <0, 2, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 7>.
