Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0 - 3 connections
Node 1 - 2 connections
Node 8 - 2 connections
Node 9 - 3 connections
Node 6 - 4 connections
Node 7 - 4 connections
Node 3 - 4 connections
Node 5 - 4 connections
Node 2 - 5 connections
Node 4 - 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2):
   - Node 0 (3 connections) < Node 2 (5 connections)
     Shared connections: {6}
     Triangle: <0, 2, 6>

2. Edge (0, 6):
   - Node 0 (3 connections) < Node 6 (4 connections)
     Shared connections: {}
     No triangle formed.

3. Edge (0, 8):
   - Node 0 (3 connections) < Node 8 (2 connections)
     Shared connections: {}
     No triangle formed.

4. Edge (1, 6):
   - Node 1 (2 connections) < Node 6 (4 connections)
     Shared connections: {}
     No triangle formed.

5. Edge (1, 9):
   - Node 1 (2 connections) < Node 9 (3 connections)
     Shared connections: {}
     No triangle formed.

6. Edge (3, 2):
   - Node 3 (4 connections) < Node 2 (5 connections)
     Shared connections: {4}
     Triangle: <3, 2, 4>

7. Edge (3, 4):
   - Node 3 (4 connections) < Node 4 (4 connections)
     Shared connections: {}
     No triangle formed.

8. Edge (3, 8):
   - Node 3 (4 connections) < Node 8 (2 connections)
     Shared connections: {}
     No triangle formed.

9. Edge (4, 2):
   - Node 4 (4 connections) < Node 2 (5 connections)
     Shared connections: {7}
     Triangle: <4, 2, 7>

10. Edge (5, 3):
     ...

[Total number of triangles: 2]
