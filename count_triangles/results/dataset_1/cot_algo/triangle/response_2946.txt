Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees in non-decreasing order, we have the following:
Nodes: 4, 0, 2, 9, 1, 8, 5, 7, 3

Calculating the number of triangles:
1. For edge (0, 9):
    - Node 0 is connected to node 9.
    - No triangle is formed.

2. For edge (1, 3):
    - Node 1 is connected to node 3.
    - No triangle is formed.

3. For edge (1, 7):
    - Node 1 is connected to node 7.
    - No triangle is formed.

4. For edge (2, 3):
    - Node 2 is connected to node 3.
    - No triangle is formed.

5. For edge (3, 1):
    - Node 3 is connected to node 1.
    - No triangle is formed.

6. For edge (3, 2):
    - Node 3 is connected to node 2.
    - No triangle is formed.

7. For edge (3, 5):
    - Node 3 is connected to node 5.
    - No triangle is formed.

8. For edge (5, 3):
    - Node 5 is connected to node 3.
    - Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>.

9. For edge (5, 7):
    - Node 5 is connected to node 7.
    - No triangle is formed.

10. For edge (5, 8):
    - Node 5 is connected to node 8.
    - No triangle is formed.

11. For edge (7, 1):
    - Node 7 is connected to node 1.
    - No triangle is formed.

12. For edge (7, 5):
    - Node 7 is connected to node 5.
    - Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>.

13. For edge (7, 8):
    - Node 7 is connected to node 8.
    - No triangle is formed.

14. For edge (7, 9):
    - Node 7 is connected to node 9.
    - No triangle is formed.

15. For edge (8, 5):
    - Node 8 is connected to node 5.
    - No triangle is formed.

16. For edge (8, 7):
    - Node 8 is connected to node 7.
    - No triangle is formed.

17. For edge (9, 0):
    - Node 9 is connected to node 0.
    - No triangle is formed.

18. For edge (9, 7):
    - Node 9 is connected to node 7.
    - No triangle is formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <3, 5, 7>.
