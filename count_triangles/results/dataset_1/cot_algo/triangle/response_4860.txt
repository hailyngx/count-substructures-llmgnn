Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 3 - 1 connection
Node 6 - 1 connection
Node 8 - 1 connection
Node 0 - 2 connections
Node 1 - 2 connections
Node 9 - 2 connections
Node 2 - 3 connections
Node 7 - 3 connections
Node 4 - 4 connections
Node 5 - 6 connections

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. For edge (0, 5) with lower label vertex 0:
   - Vertex 0 shares connections with vertices 5 and 6, forming triangle <0, 5, 6>.

2. For edge (0, 6) with lower label vertex 0:
   - Vertex 0 shares connections with vertex 5, forming triangle <0, 5, 6>.

3. For edge (1, 4) with lower label vertex 1:
   - Vertex 1 shares connections with vertex 9, forming triangle <1, 4, 9>.

4. For edge (1, 9) with lower label vertex 1:
   - No triangle is formed.

5. For edge (2, 5) with lower label vertex 2:
   - Vertex 2 shares connections with vertices 0 and 7, forming triangles <0, 2, 5> and <2, 5, 7>.

6. For edge (2, 7) with lower label vertex 2:
   - Vertex 2 shares connections with vertex 5, forming triangle <2, 5, 7>.

7. For edge (3, 8) with lower label vertex 3:
   - No triangle is formed.

8. For edge (4, 1) with lower label vertex 1:
   - Vertex 1 shares connections with vertex 9, forming triangle <1, 4, 9>.

9. For edge (4, 5) with lower label vertex 4:
   - Vertex 4 shares connections with vertices 1 and 9, forming triangle <1, 4, 9>.

10. For edge (4, 9) with lower label vertex 4:
   - Vertex 4 shares connections with vertex 1, forming triangle <1, 4, 9>.

11. For edge (5, 0) with lower label vertex 0:
   - No triangle is formed.

12. For edge (5, 2) with lower label vertex 2:
   - Vertex 2 shares connections with vertex 7, forming triangle <2, 5, 7>.

13. For edge (5, 4) with lower label vertex 4:
   - Vertex 4 shares connections with vertices 1 and 9, forming triangle <1, 4, 9>.

14. For edge (5, 7) with lower label vertex 5:
   - Vertex 5 shares connections with vertices 0, 2, and 4, forming triangles <0, 2, 5> and <2, 5, 7>.

15. For edge (6, 0) with lower label vertex 0:
   - Vertex 0 shares connections with vertex 5, forming triangle <0, 5, 6>.

16. For edge (7, 2) with lower label vertex 2:
   - Vertex 2 shares connections with vertex 5, forming triangle <2, 5, 7>.

17. For edge (7, 5) with lower label vertex 5:
   - Vertex 5 shares connections with vertices 0, 2, and 4, forming triangles <0, 2, 5> and <2, 5, 7>.

18. For edge (8, 3) with lower label vertex 3:
   - No triangle is formed.

19. For edge (9, 1) with lower label vertex 1:
   - No triangle is formed.

20. For edge (9, 4) with lower label vertex 4:
   - Vertex 4 shares connections with vertex 1, forming triangle <1, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
