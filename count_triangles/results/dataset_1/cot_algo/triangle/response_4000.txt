Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new vertex labels are 3, 7, 9, 4, 8, 0, 5, 1, 2, 6.
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find that there are 11 triangles in the given graph:
[11]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <6, 8, 9>
