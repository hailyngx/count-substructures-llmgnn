Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 5 - Degree 0
Node 1 - Degree 1
Node 2 - Degree 1
Node 9 - Degree 2
Node 0 - Degree 2
Node 3 - Degree 3
Node 5 - Degree 3
Node 7 - Degree 4
Node 4 - Degree 5
Node 6 - Degree 6

Using the degree-based ordering method, we iterate through the edges:
Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
Edge (3, 7): No triangles formed.
Edge (4, 3): No triangles formed.
Edge (4, 6): Triangle <3, 4, 6> found.
Edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
Edge (4, 8): Triangle <4, 6, 8> found.
Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
Edge (6, 0): No triangles formed.
Edge (6, 4): No triangles formed.
Edge (6, 5): No triangles formed.
Edge (6, 7): Triangle <4, 6, 7> found.
Edge (6, 8): Triangle <4, 6, 8> found.
Edge (7, 3): No triangles formed.
Edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
Edge (7, 6): Triangle <4, 6, 7> found.
Edge (7, 8): Triangle <4, 6, 8> found.
Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.
Edge (8, 1): No triangles formed.
Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed.
Edge (8, 4): Triangle <4, 6, 8> found.
Edge (8, 6): Triangle <4, 6, 8> found.
Edge (8, 7): Triangle <4, 6, 8> found.
Edge (9, 0): No triangles formed.
Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.
Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>.
