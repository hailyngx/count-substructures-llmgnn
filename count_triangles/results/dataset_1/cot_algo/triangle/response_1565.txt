Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the number of connections each vertex has:

Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 4: 2 connections  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 6: 1 connection  
Node 7: 2 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 9: 5 connections  

Next, we sort the nodes based on the number of connections in increasing order and relabel them accordingly:

Node 6 (1 connection) becomes Node 0  
Node 7 (2 connections) becomes Node 1  
Node 4 (2 connections) becomes Node 2  
Node 0 (3 connections) becomes Node 3  
Node 2 (3 connections) becomes Node 4  
Node 5 (3 connections) becomes Node 5  
Node 8 (3 connections) becomes Node 6  
Node 1 (4 connections) becomes Node 7  
Node 3 (4 connections) becomes Node 8  
Node 9 (5 connections) becomes Node 9  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges:

1. Edge (0, 1) - Node 0 (1) has 1 neighbor, Node 1 (4) has 4 neighbors. No triangle.
2. Edge (0, 4) - Node 0 (1) has 1 neighbor, Node 2 (7) has 2 neighbors. No triangle.
3. Edge (0, 9) - Node 0 (1) has 1 neighbor, Node 9 (9) has 5 neighbors. No triangle.
4. Edge (1, 0) - Node 1 (4) has 4 neighbors, Node 0 (1) has 1 neighbor. No triangle.

30. Edge (9, 7) - Node 9 (9) has 5 neighbors, Node 1 (4) has 4 neighbors. No triangle.

There are a total of 5 unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 9, 2>
<4, 0, 2>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
