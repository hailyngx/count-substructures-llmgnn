Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Now, we will go through each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 have 2 shared connections - triangles: <0, 4, 9>.
2. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 and Node 9 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
3. Edge (1, 3): Node 1 and Node 3 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
4. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 and Node 5 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
5. Edge (1, 8): Node 1 and Node 8 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
6. Edge (2, 3): Node 2 and Node 3 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
7. Edge (2, 8): Node 2 and Node 8 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
8. Edge (2, 9): Node 2 and Node 9 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
9. Edge (3, 1): Node 1 and Node 3 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
10. Edge (3, 2): Node 2 and Node 3 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
11. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 and Node 8 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
12. Edge (4, 0): Node 0 and Node 4 have 2 shared connections - triangles: <0, 4, 9>.
13. Edge (4, 9): Node 4 and Node 9 have 2 shared connections - triangles: <0, 4, 9>.
14. Edge (5, 1): Node 1 and Node 5 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
15. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 and Node 6 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
16. Edge (5, 9): Node 5 and Node 9 have 2 shared connections - triangles: <0, 4, 9>.
17. Edge (6, 5): Node 5 and Node 6 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
18. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 and Node 7 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
19. Edge (7, 6): Node 6 and Node 7 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
20. Edge (7, 8): Node 7 and Node 8 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
21. Edge (8, 1): Node 1 and Node 8 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
22. Edge (8, 2): Node 2 and Node 8 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
23. Edge (8, 3): Node 3 and Node 8 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
24. Edge (8, 7): Node 7 and Node 8 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
25. Edge (9, 0): Node 0 and Node 9 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
26. Edge (9, 2): Node 2 and Node 9 have 1 shared connection - no triangle.
27. Edge (9, 4): Node 4 and Node 9 have 2 shared connections - triangles: <0, 4, 9>.
28. Edge (9, 5): Node 5 and Node 9 have 2 shared connections - triangles: <0, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
