Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeling: 

Node 5 (degree 2) -> Node 1
Node 1 (degree 3) -> Node 2
Node 4 (degree 3) -> Node 3
Node 6 (degree 4) -> Node 4
Node 8 (degree 2) -> Node 5
Node 9 (degree 2) -> Node 6
Node 7 (degree 3) -> Node 7
Node 2 (degree 4) -> Node 8
Node 3 (degree 4) -> Node 9

Now, examining the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Edge (1, 5): Forms Triangle(s): None
Edge (1, 6): Forms Triangle(s): <1, 4, 2>
Edge (1, 2): Forms Triangle(s): None
Edge (2, 9): Forms Triangle(s): <8, 6, 9>
Edge (7, 2): Forms Triangle(s): None
Edge (9, 3): Forms Triangle(s): <8, 6, 4>

Count of triangles inside brackets: [2]
Unique triangles found: <1, 4, 2>, <8, 6, 9>
