Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection

Now, we proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 1): Form triangle with shared connection 5. Triangle <0, 1, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (1, 4): Form triangle with shared connection 3. Triangle <1, 4, 3>.
4. Edge (1, 6): Form triangle with shared connection 5. Triangle <1, 6, 5>.
5. Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 5>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 6, 5>.
