Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 5 has 1 connection
Nodes 1, 2, 7, and 10 have 2 connections each
Nodes 3 and 9 have 3 connections each
Nodes 4 and 8 have 4 connections each
Node 6 has 5 connections
Node 0 has 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start by examining edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This will help us count the number of triangles efficiently. 

There are 5 triangles in the graph, which are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9> 
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
