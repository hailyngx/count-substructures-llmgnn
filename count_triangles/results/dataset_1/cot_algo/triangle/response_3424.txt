Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices will be as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 1
- Vertex 9: degree 1

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
Checking these edges, we find the triangles formed by the shared connections:
- Triangle <0, 2, 3>
- Triangle <1, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
