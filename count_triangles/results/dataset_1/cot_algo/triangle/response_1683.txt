Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By counting the number of connections for each vertex, we can create a Degree-Based Ordering as follows:  

Vertex 0 has degree 3  
Vertex 1 has degree 3  
Vertex 4 has degree 3  
Vertex 9 has degree 1  
Vertex 8 has degree 1  
Vertex 7 has degree 4  
Vertex 6 has degree 3  
Vertex 5 has degree 4  
Vertex 2 has degree 4  
Vertex 3 has degree 5  

Based on the ordering above, we can re-label the vertices so that the vertex with the lowest degree is relabeled as 0, the next lowest as 1, and so on.  

The new ordering becomes:  

Vertex 9 -> 0  
Vertex 8 -> 1  
Vertex 0 -> 2  
Vertex 1 -> 3  
Vertex 4 -> 4  
Vertex 6 -> 5  
Vertex 7 -> 6  
Vertex 5 -> 7  
Vertex 2 -> 8  
Vertex 3 -> 9  

Now, checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles.  

Triangles:
<2, 0, 3>  
<2, 0, 4>  
<2, 3, 5>  
<2, 3, 7>  
<2, 5, 4>  
<5, 4, 6>  
<5, 4, 7>  

Total number of triangles: [7]
