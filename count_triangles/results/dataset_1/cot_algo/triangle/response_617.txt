Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have the following mapping:
0 -> 2 connections
1 -> 2 connections
3 -> 2 connections
5 -> 1 connection
6 -> 1 connection
9 -> 1 connection
7 -> 3 connections
8 -> 3 connections
4 -> 4 connections
2 -> 5 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:
Analyzing the edges with the lower labeled vertex first:

(0, 2) -> Shared connection with 7 forms a triangle: <0, 2, 7>
(1, 2) -> No triangles
(3, 4) -> No triangles
(5, 3) -> No triangles
(6, 4) -> No triangles
(7, 0) -> Shared connection with 2 forms a triangle: <0, 2, 7>
(8, 2) -> Shared connections with 2 and 7 form two triangles: <0, 2, 7> and <2, 7, 8>
(9, 4) -> No triangles

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 7>, <2, 7, 8>
