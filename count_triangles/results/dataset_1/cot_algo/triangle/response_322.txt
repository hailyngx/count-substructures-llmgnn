Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we get the following new labels:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges in the following order:
(1, 0), (7, 5), (7, 2), (5, 1), (2, 7), (8, 0), (6, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 3), (1, 3), (3, 1), (5, 7), (0, 1), (0, 6), (3, 4), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 6), (4, 9), (6, 4), (9, 2), (2, 9), (4, 3)

By following the process described earlier, we find that there are:
Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 9>
