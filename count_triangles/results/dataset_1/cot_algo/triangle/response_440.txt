Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 5: 6 connections

Using the degree-based ordering method, the triangles found in this graph are:
[17]
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 8, 9>
