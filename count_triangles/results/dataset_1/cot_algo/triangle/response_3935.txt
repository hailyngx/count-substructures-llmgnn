Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Then, relabel the vertices according to their sorted order. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their connections is as follows:
Vertex 7 (Degree 2)
Vertex 4 (Degree 2)
Vertex 5 (Degree 2)
Vertex 6 (Degree 2)
Vertex 2 (Degree 3)
Vertex 9 (Degree 4)
Vertex 1 (Degree 4)
Vertex 3 (Degree 4)
Vertex 8 (Degree 4)
Vertex 0 (Degree 4)

After relabeling based on the sorted order, the new list is:
Vertex 7 (Degree 2)
Vertex 4 (Degree 2)
Vertex 5 (Degree 2)
Vertex 6 (Degree 2)
Vertex 2 (Degree 3)
Vertex 1 (Degree 4)
Vertex 3 (Degree 4)
Vertex 8 (Degree 4)
Vertex 0 (Degree 4)
Vertex 9 (Degree 4)

Now, we will count the triangles. 
Starting from the edges with the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:
- (0, 3) is valid, and the shared connection is 9, forming the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
- (0, 8) is not valid as both 0 and 8 have the same number of connections.
- (0, 9) is valid, and the shared connection is 3, forming the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
- (1, 3) is not valid as both 1 and 3 have the same number of connections.
- (1, 4) is valid, and the shared connection is 6, forming the triangle <1, 4, 6>.
- (1, 6) is valid, and the shared connection is 2, forming the triangle <1, 2, 6>.
- (1, 8) is not valid as both 1 and 8 have the same number of connections.
- (2, 6) is not valid as both 2 and 6 have the same number of connections.
- (2, 8) is valid, and the shared connection is 1, forming the triangle <1, 2, 8>.
- (3, 9) is valid, and the shared connection is 0, forming the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
- (4, 5) is valid, and the shared connection is 7, forming the triangle <4, 5, 7>.
- (5, 7) is valid, and the shared connection is 4, forming the triangle <4, 5, 7>.
- (7, 9) is valid, and the shared connection is 5, forming the triangle <5, 7, 9>.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, and <4, 5, 7>.
