Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices with their degrees is as follows:
(0: 3), (1: 3), (5: 3), (8: 1), (9: 3), (6: 3), (3: 4), (4: 5), (2: 4), (7: 5)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Checking the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 2) -> 0: (4, 7), 2: (0, 7, 9), shared connections: (0, 2, 7) <0, 2, 7>
(0, 4) -> 0: (2, 7), 4: (1, 3, 6, 7), shared connections: (4)
(0, 7) -> 0: (2, 4), 7: (1, 2, 3, 4), shared connections: (2, 4)
(1, 3) -> 1: (4, 7), 3: (0, 4, 7, 9), shared connections: (4, 7) <1, 3, 4>
(1, 4) -> 1: (3, 7), 4: (0, 3, 6, 7), shared connections: (4, 7)
(1, 7) -> 1: (3, 4), 7: (0, 2, 3, 4), shared connections: (3, 4)
(5, 6) -> 5: (9), 6: (4, 8), shared connections: none
(5, 9) -> 5: (6), 9: (2, 3), shared connections: none
(6, 8) -> 6: (5), 8: none, shared connections: none

The total number of triangles is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7> and <1, 3, 4>.
