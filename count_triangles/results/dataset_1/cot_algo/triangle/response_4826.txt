Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:  
Node 1 has degree 1  
Node 7 has degree 2  
Node 0 has degree 3  
Node 8 has degree 3  
Node 5 has degree 4  
Node 4 has degree 4  
Node 9 has degree 4  
Node 6 has degree 5  
Node 2 has degree 5  
Node 3 has degree 5  

Using the degree-based ordering method:  
(1, 6) - No triangles  
(7, 4) - No triangles  
(0, 3) - Forms a triangle <0, 3, 2>  
(8, 6) - Forms a triangle <8, 6, 2>  
(5, 6) - Forms a triangle <5, 6, 2>  
(4, 7) - No triangles  
(9, 8) - No triangles  
(6, 1) - No triangles  
(2, 3) - Forms a triangle <2, 3, 5>  
(3, 0) - No triangles  
(4, 8) - No triangles  
(4, 5) - Forms a triangle <4, 5, 6>  
(9, 2) - Forms a triangle <9, 2, 5>  
(6, 7) - No triangles  
(8, 0) - Forms a triangle <8, 0, 3>  
(2, 5) - No triangles  
(5, 9) - No triangles  
(8, 4) - No triangles  
(6, 2) - Forms a triangle <6, 2, 3>  
(7, 6) - No triangles  
(0, 8) - No triangles  
(4, 3) - Forms a triangle <4, 3, 5>  
(5, 4) - No triangles  
(2, 9) - No triangles  

Total number of triangles: [5]  
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 2>, <8, 6, 2>, <5, 6, 2>, <2, 3, 5>, <4, 5, 6>
