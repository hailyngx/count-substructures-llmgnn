Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on the number of connections they have in ascending order:
Vertices: 1(2), 3(2), 0(3), 4(3), 6(3), 8(3), 9(7), 2(4), 5(4), 7(4)

Let's identify the triangles based on shared connections:
- Triangle 1: <0, 8, 4>
- Triangle 2: <4, 9, 5>
- Triangle 3: <6, 9, 7>
- Triangle 4: <9, 2, 3>
- Triangle 5: <9, 6, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
