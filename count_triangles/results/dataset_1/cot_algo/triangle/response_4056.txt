Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:

Node 4 - 0 connections
Node 1 - 1 connection
Node 7 - 1 connection
Node 3 - 2 connections
Node 8 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 3 connections
Node 6 - 3 connections
Node 2 - 3 connections
Node 9 - 6 connections
Node 0 - 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge in the graph:
- Edge (0, 1): Forms triangles with nodes 8 and 9. <0, 1, 8> and <0, 1, 9>
- Edge (0, 8): Forms a triangle with node 9. <0, 8, 9>
- Edge (0, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 3. <0, 9, 2> and <0, 9, 3>
- Edge (1, 0): Already counted when considering edge (0, 1).
- Edge (2, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 9): Forms a triangle with node 6. <5, 9, 6>
- Edge (6, 5): Already counted when considering edge (5, 6).
- Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 0. <6, 9, 5> and <6, 9, 0>
- Edge (7, 6): Already counted when considering edge (6, 7).
- Edge (8, 0): Already counted when considering edge (0, 8).
- Edge (8, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 0): Already counted when considering edge (0, 9).
- Edge (9, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 5): Forms a triangle with node 6. <9, 5, 6>
- Edge (9, 6): Already counted when considering edge (6, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 3>, <5, 9, 6>, <6, 9, 5>, and <6, 9, 0>.
