Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8)
