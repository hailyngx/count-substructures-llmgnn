Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 6, 1, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 8, 0, 4.

After relabeling the vertices, the edges to consider based on the Degree-Based Ordering method are: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 7), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 8), (8, 9).

By checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 8, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <8, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
