Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows: 
Vertices: 2, 6, 4, 3, 9, 8, 5, 7, 1, 0

Therefore, the degree-based ordering starting from 0 is: 
Vertex 2 has degree 2.
Vertex 6 has degree 2.
Vertex 4 has degree 2.
Vertex 3 has degree 2.
Vertex 9 has degree 4.
Vertex 8 has degree 4.
Vertex 5 has degree 4.
Vertex 7 has degree 5.
Vertex 1 has degree 5.
Vertex 0 has degree 5.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles in the graph. 

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <6, 7, 9>
