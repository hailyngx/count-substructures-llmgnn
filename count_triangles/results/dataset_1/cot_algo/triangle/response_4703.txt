Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their connections:

Vertices by number of connections:
1. Vertex 7 (Degree 0)
2. Vertex 7 (Degree 0)
3. Vertex 3 (Degree 1)
4. Vertex 5 (Degree 1)
5. Vertex 6 (Degree 1)
6. Vertex 3 (Degree 1)
7. Vertex 5 (Degree 1)
8. Vertex 2 (Degree 2)
9. Vertex 4 (Degree 5)
10. Vertex 9 (Degree 3)

Based on the sorting above, we can now count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [2]
