Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's arrange the vertices based on their degrees:

0: 2 connections
6: 1 connection
7: 1 connection
4: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
2: 3 connections

Next, we will list the edges in ascending order of the vertex labels and only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(0, 3) -> forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 2, 3>
(0, 9) -> forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 2, 9>
(1, 2) -> no triangle
(1, 4) -> no triangle
(1, 5) -> forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <1, 4, 5>
(1, 7) -> no triangle
(2, 3) -> forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <2, 3, 9>
(3, 8) -> forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <3, 5, 8>
(4, 5) -> no triangle
(5, 6) -> no triangle
(5, 8) -> forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <3, 5, 8>
(5, 9) -> forms a triangle with shared connections 0 and 2: <0, 2, 9>
(7, 1) -> no triangle

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
