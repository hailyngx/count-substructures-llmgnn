Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree of connections, from least to most connections. The sorted list of vertices with their corresponding degrees is as follows:
```
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
```
Now, we will check each edge starting from the vertex with the lower label. 
The triangles formed by the shared connections are as follows:
```
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 1>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 5, 0>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 9, 0>
<6, 9, 2>
<9, 4, 6>
```
Counting the unique triangles gives a total of 10 triangles in this graph.
Therefore, the output should be [10].
