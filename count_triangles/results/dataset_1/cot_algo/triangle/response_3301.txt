Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
0 - 2 connections 
1 - 2 connections 
4 - 2 connections 
7 - 1 connection 
9 - 4 connections 
3 - 3 connections 
6 - 3 connections 
5 - 4 connections 
8 - 4 connections 
2 - 5 connections 

Now we will relabel the vertices from lowest to highest number of connections:
0 -> 0 
1 -> 1 
4 -> 2 
7 -> 3 
9 -> 4 
3 -> 5 
6 -> 6 
5 -> 7 
8 -> 8 
2 -> 9 

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 
[7]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 8>.
