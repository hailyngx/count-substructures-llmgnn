Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 - 3 connections
Node 3 - 0 connections
Node 5 - 2 connections
Node 8 - 3 connections
Node 9 - 3 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 2 - 4 connections
Node 7 - 4 connections
Node 6 - 7 connections
Node 4 - 9 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
- Triangle 1: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 2: <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle 3: <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle 4: <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
