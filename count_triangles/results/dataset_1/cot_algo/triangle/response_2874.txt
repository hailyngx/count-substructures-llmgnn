Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
```
0 - 3 connections
1 - 1 connection
2 - 2 connections
3 - 2 connections
4 - 4 connections
5 - 4 connections
6 - 4 connections
7 - 3 connections
8 - 2 connections
9 - 7 connections
```

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Checking each edge, we find the following triangles: 
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle 4: <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle 5: <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5]. Let me know if you need any more assistance.
