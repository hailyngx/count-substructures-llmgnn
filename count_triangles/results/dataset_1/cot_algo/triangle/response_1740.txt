Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we obtain the following labels for the vertices:
Vertices: 1(1), 5(2), 7(3), 2(4), 3(5), 4(6), 6(7), 8(8), 0(9)

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (1, 0): Vertex 1 has one connection and Vertex 0 has five connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 2): Vertex 5 has three connections and Vertex 2 has three connections. Shared connection with Vertex 0. Triangle <0, 2, 5>.
- Edge (7, 1): Vertex 7 has three connections and Vertex 1 has three connections. Shared connection with Vertex 0. Triangle <0, 1, 7>.
- Edge (2, 0): Vertex 2 has three connections and Vertex 0 has five connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 has four connections and Vertex 5 has three connections. Shared connection with Vertex 0. Triangle <0, 3, 5>.
- Edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 has four connections and Vertex 6 has five connections. Shared connection with Vertex 0. Triangle <0, 4, 6>.
- Edge (6, 1): Vertex 6 has five connections and Vertex 1 has three connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 0): Vertex 8 has five connections and Vertex 0 has five connections. Shared connection with Vertex 4. Triangle <0, 4, 8>.
- Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has five connections and Vertex 8 has five connections. Shared connection with Vertex 4. Triangle <0, 4, 8>.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 6>
