Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 0: 8 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- (0, 3) shares connections with 0-8 and 3-8, forming triangle <0, 3, 8>.
- (0, 5) shares a connection with 0-9 and 5-6, forming triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
- (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
- (0, 9) does not form a triangle.
- (1, 2) does not form a triangle.
- (2, 1) does not form a triangle.
- (2, 7) shares a connection with 2-9 and 7-9, forming triangle <2, 7, 9>.
- (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
- (3, 0) shares connections with 0-8 and 3-8, forming triangle <0, 3, 8>.
- (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
- (4, 9) does not form a triangle.
- (5, 0) shares a connection with 0-9 and 5-6, forming triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
- (6, 5) does not form a triangle.
- (7, 0) does not form a triangle.
- (7, 2) shares a connection with 2-9 and 7-9, forming triangle <2, 7, 9>.
- (8, 0) does not form a triangle.
- (8, 3) does not form a triangle.
- (8, 9) does not form a triangle.
- (9, 0) shares a connection with 0-8 and 9-8, forming triangle <0, 3, 8>.
- (9, 2) does not form a triangle.
- (9, 4) does not form a triangle.
- (9, 8) does not form a triangle.
