Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degrees of each vertex in the graph are as follows:
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 6 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections

Sorting the vertices by their degrees, we get:
Vertex 2 < Vertex 1 < Vertex 3 < Vertex 4 < Vertex 8 < Vertex 6 < Vertex 9 < Vertex 5 < Vertex 0 < Vertex 7

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 5, 7>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
