Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and counting the triangles in the given graph:

Nodes sorted by number of connections:
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<8, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
