Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each node:

- Node 0: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 1
- Node 3: Degree 2
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 5
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 2

Now, we need to relabel the nodes based on their degrees in non-decreasing order:
- Node 2 (Degree 1)
- Node 1 (Degree 2)
- Node 3 (Degree 2)
- Node 7 (Degree 2)
- Node 9 (Degree 2)
- Node 0 (Degree 3)
- Node 4 (Degree 3)
- Node 6 (Degree 3)
- Node 8 (Degree 3)
- Node 5 (Degree 5)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge starting from the one with the lowest labeled vertex and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles:
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
