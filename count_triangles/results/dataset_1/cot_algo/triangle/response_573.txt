Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After relabeling the nodes based on their degree, the graph is as follows:
Vertices: 0(5), 1(3), 2(4), 3(4), 4(3), 5(1), 6(6), 7(3), 8(2), 9(5)

Edges to consider: (1, 6), (1, 7), (8, 2), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Calculating triangles:
- For edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
- For edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
- For edge (8, 2): No triangle formed.
- For edge (9, 5): No triangle formed.
- For edge (9, 7): Triangle formed: <1, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [1]
