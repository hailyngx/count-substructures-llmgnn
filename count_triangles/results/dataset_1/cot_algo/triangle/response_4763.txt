Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections they have. Here is the list of vertices with their respective connections:

0: 1 connection
3: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
9: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
5: 5 connections
1: 5 connections
8: 5 connections
2: 6 connections

Based on this ordering, we will traverse the edges while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
