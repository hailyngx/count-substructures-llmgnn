Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees.

After sorting the nodes based on the number of connections, the new ordering is: 
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

By iterating through each edge and checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles: 
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
[6 triangles in total]
