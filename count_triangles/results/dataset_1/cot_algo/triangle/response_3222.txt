Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their degree (number of connections):

Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 0
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 1
Node 5: degree 1
Node 6: degree 0
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 6
Node 9: degree 3

Now, we will check for triangles based on the sorted labels:

Triangles:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 8, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 8, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<8, 7, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
