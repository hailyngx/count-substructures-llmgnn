Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
0 -> 1 connections
1 -> 2 connections
2 -> 1 connections
3 -> 3 connections
4 -> 1 connections
5 -> 3 connections
6 -> 4 connections
7 -> 5 connections
8 -> 2 connections
9 -> 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 1): Forms triangle with 5: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (0, 5): Forms triangle with 1: <0, 5, 1>
- Edge (0, 7): Forms triangle with 8 and 9: <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>
- Edge (0, 8): No triangles
- Edge (1, 5): Forms triangle with 6: <1, 5, 6>
- Edge (2, 7): No triangles
- Edge (3, 6): Forms triangle with 9: <3, 6, 9>
- Edge (3, 7): Forms triangle with 9: <3, 7, 9>
- Edge (3, 9): Forms triangle with 6 and 7: <3, 9, 6>, <3, 9, 7>
- Edge (4, 6): No triangles
- Edge (5, 6): Forms triangle with 0: <5, 6, 0>
- Edge (6, 3): Forms triangle with 9: <6, 3, 9>
- Edge (6, 4): No triangles
- Edge (6, 5): Forms triangle with 0: <6, 5, 0>
- Edge (6, 7): Forms triangle with 9: <6, 7, 9>
- Edge (6, 9): Forms triangle with 3 and 7: <6, 9, 3>, <6, 9, 7>
- Edge (7, 0): Forms triangle with 8 and 9: <7, 0, 8>, <7, 0, 9>
- Edge (7, 2): No triangles
- Edge (7, 3): Forms triangle with 9: <7, 3, 9>
- Edge (7, 6): Forms triangle with 9: <7, 6, 9>
- Edge (7, 9): Forms triangle with 0 and 6: <7, 9, 0>, <7, 9, 6>
- Edge (8, 0): No triangles
- Edge (8, 9): No triangles
- Edge (9, 3): Forms triangle with 6 and 7: <9, 3, 6>, <9, 3, 7>
- Edge (9, 6): Forms triangle with 3 and 7: <9, 6, 3>, <9, 6, 7>
- Edge (9, 7): Forms triangle with 0 and 6: <9, 7, 0>, <9, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [18].
