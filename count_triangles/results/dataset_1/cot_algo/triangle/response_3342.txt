Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After organizing the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabeling them accordingly, the new ordering of vertices becomes: 
Vertices: 8, 0, 4, 1, 3, 9, 5, 2, 6, 7.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge between vertices 0 and 3: Both vertices have a degree of 2. No triangle formed.
2. Edge between vertices 0 and 7: Vertex 0 has a degree of 2, while vertex 7 has a degree of 6. Possible triangles: <0, 7, x> where x is a common neighbor. Triangles formed: <0, 7, 1> and <0, 7, 5>.
3. Edge between vertices 1 and 7: Both vertices have a degree of 2. No triangle formed.
4. Edge between vertices 1 and 9: Both vertices have a degree of 2. No triangle formed.
5. Edge between vertices 2 and 4: Both vertices have a degree of 2. No triangle formed.
6. Edge between vertices 2 and 5: Vertex 2 has a degree of 5, while vertex 5 has a degree of 3. Possible triangles: <2, 5, x> where x is a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 7>.
7. Edge between vertices 2 and 6: Vertex 2 has a degree of 5, while vertex 6 has a degree of 4. Possible triangles: <2, 6, x> where x is a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 7>.
8. Edge between vertices 3 and 0: Both vertices have a degree of 2. No triangle formed.
9. Edge between vertices 4 and 2: Both vertices have a degree of 2. No triangle formed.
10. Edge between vertices 5 and 2: We already considered this edge.
11. Edge between vertices 5 and 7: We already considered this edge.
12. Edge between vertices 6 and 2: We already considered this edge.
13. Edge between vertices 6 and 7: We already considered this edge.
14. Edge between vertices 6 and 9: Vertex 6 has a degree of 4, while vertex 9 has a degree of 2. Possible triangle: <6, 9, 1>. Triangles formed: <6, 9, 1>.
15. Edge between vertices 7 and 0: We already considered this edge.
16. Edge between vertices 7 and 1: We already considered this edge.
17. Edge between vertices 7 and 5: We already considered this edge.
18. Edge between vertices 7 and 6: We already considered this edge.
19. Edge between vertices 7 and 8: Vertex 7 has a degree of 6, while vertex 8 has a degree of 1. No triangle formed.
20. Edge between vertices 8 and 7: Vertex 8 has a degree of 1, while vertex 7 has a degree of 6. No triangle formed.
21. Edge between vertices 9 and 1: We already considered this edge.
22. Edge between vertices 9 and 6: We already considered this edge.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles are <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 5>, and <6, 9, 1>.
