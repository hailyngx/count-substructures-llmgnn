Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:
- Node 7: Degree 1
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 2
- Node 6: Degree 2
- Node 4: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 7
- Node 3: Degree 7
- Node 9: Degree 8

Now, we will examine each edge to count the triangles formed:
- (0, 3): No triangles formed.
- (0, 9): No triangles formed.
- (1, 2): No triangles formed.
- (1, 3): Triangle formed: <1, 2, 3>.
- (1, 4): No triangles formed.
- (1, 6): No triangles formed.
- (1, 8): No triangles formed.
- (1, 9): Triangle formed: <1, 3, 9>.
- (2, 1): No triangles formed.
- (2, 3): No triangles formed.
- (2, 9): Triangle formed: <1, 2, 9>.
- (3, 0): No triangles formed.
- (3, 1): Triangle formed: <1, 2, 3>.
- (3, 2): No triangles formed.
- (3, 8): No triangles formed.
- (4, 1): No triangles formed.
- (4, 9): No triangles formed.
- (5, 8): No triangles formed.
- (5, 9): No triangles formed.
- (6, 1): No triangles formed.
- (7, 9): No triangles formed.
- (8, 1): No triangles formed.
- (8, 3): No triangles formed.
- (8, 5): No triangles formed.
- (9, 0): No triangles formed.
- (9, 1): Triangle formed: <1, 3, 9>.
- (9, 2): Triangle formed: <1, 2, 9>.
- (9, 4): No triangles formed.
- (9, 5): No triangles formed.
- (9, 7): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
