Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph. 

First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
- Node 5: Degree 1
- Node 1, 4: Degree 2
- Node 7, 9: Degree 3
- Node 0, 6, 8: Degree 4
- Node 2, 3: Degree 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Node 5: Label 0
- Node 1, 4: Label 1
- Node 7, 9: Label 2
- Node 0, 6, 8: Label 3
- Node 2, 3: Label 4

With the relabeled vertices, let's check the edges (sorted by the lower labeled vertex):
- Edge (0, 3): Forms triangle with shared connection 7
- Edge (0, 6): No triangle formed
- Edge (0, 7): Forms triangle with shared connection 3 and 9
- Edge (0, 9): Forms triangle with shared connection 3 and 7
- Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed
- Edge (1, 3): No triangle formed
- Edge (1, 8): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 1): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 4): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 7): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 8): No triangle formed
- Edge (3, 0): Already counted
- Edge (3, 1): Already counted
- Edge (3, 7): Already counted
- Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed
- Edge (3, 9): Already counted
- Edge (4, 2): No triangle formed
- Edge (4, 6): No triangle formed
- Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed
- Edge (5, 7): No triangle formed
- Edge (6, 0): Already counted
- Edge (6, 4): No triangle formed
- Edge (6, 8): No triangle formed
- Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed
- Edge (7, 0): Already counted
- Edge (7, 2): No triangle formed
- Edge (7, 3): Already counted
- Edge (7, 5): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 1): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 2): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 3): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 4): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 6): No triangle formed
- Edge (9, 0): Already counted
- Edge (9, 3): Already counted
- Edge (9, 6): No triangle formed

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found:
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 7, 9>
