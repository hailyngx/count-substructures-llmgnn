Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices will be:  
Node 0 - 2 connections  
Node 1 - 1 connection  
Node 3 - 2 connections  
Node 5 - 2 connections  
Node 9 - 1 connection  
Node 6 - 2 connections  
Node 4 - 5 connections  
Node 8 - 4 connections  
Node 7 - 5 connections  
Node 2 - 4 connections  

Now, we will go through each edge:

1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 has 2 connections and Node 2 has 4 connections. Since Node 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (0, 2): 7
2. Edge (0, 7): Node 0 has 2 connections and Node 7 has 5 connections. Since Node 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (0, 7): 2
3. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 has 1 connection which is less than Node 4's 5 connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (1, 4): None
4. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 6 has 2 connections. Since Node 6 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (2, 6): None
5. Edge (2, 9): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 9 has 1 connection. Since Node 9 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (2, 9): None
6. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has 2 connections and Node 4 has 5 connections. Since Node 3 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (3, 4): 7
7. Edge (3, 7): Node 3 has 2 connections and Node 7 has 5 connections. Since Node 3 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (3, 7): None
8. Edge (4, 1): Node 1 has 1 connection which is less than Node 4's 5 connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (4, 1): None
9. Edge (4, 3): Node 3 has 2 connections and Node 4 has 5 connections. Since Node 3 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (4, 3): 7
10. Edge (4, 5): Node 4 has 5 connections but Node 5 also has 2 connections, however, Node 5 has a higher label. Therefore, we skip this edge.
11. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 has 5 connections and Node 8 has 4 connections. Since Node 8 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (4, 8): 7
12. Edge (5, 8): Node 5 has 2 connections and Node 8 has 4 connections. Since Node 5 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (5, 8): None
13. Edge (6, 2): Node 6 has 2 connections which is less than Node 2's 4 connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (6, 2): None
14. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 has 2 connections and Node 7 has 5 connections. Since Node 6 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (6, 7): None
15. Edge (7, 0): Node 0 has 2 connections and Node 7 has 5 connections. Since Node 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (7, 0): None
16. Edge (7, 3): Node 3 has 2 connections which is less than Node 7's 5 connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (7, 3): None
17. Edge (7, 6): Node 6 has 2 connections and Node 7 has 5 connections. Since Node 6 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (7, 6): None
18. Edge (7, 8): Node 7 and Node 8 have 5 and 4 connections respectively. Since Node 8 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (7, 8): 4
19. Edge (8, 4): Node 8 has 4 connections which is less than Node 4's 5 connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (8, 4): 7
20. Edge (8, 5): Node 5 has 2 connections which is less than Node 8's 4 connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (8, 5): None  
21. Edge (8, 7): Node 7 and Node 8 have 5 and 4 connections respectively. Since Node 8 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (8, 7): 4
22. Edge (9, 2): Node 9 has 1 connection which is less than Node 2's 4 connections, we proceed.
   Shared connections with (9, 2): None
