Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertices: 5, 3, 4, 7, 6, 1, 2, 9, 8, 0

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now analyze each edge starting with the one between vertices with the lower labels and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 0, 9>
<2, 9, 8>
<9, 3, 4>
<9, 4, 8>
<9, 8, 0>
