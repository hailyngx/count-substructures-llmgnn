Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, and then relabeling the vertices accordingly.

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
Vertex 4: 0 connections
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 3: 7 connections
Vertex 7: 7 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph by examining each edge with the vertex having the lower label. Triangles are formed by shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

After counting, we find the following triangles:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
