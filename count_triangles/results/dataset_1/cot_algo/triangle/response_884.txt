Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's arrange the vertices by their degree:
Vertices by degree: [(7, 2), (8, 2), (3, 3), (6, 3), (2, 3), (4, 4), (1, 5), (5, 5), (0, 6)]

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertex 7 -> A (degree 2)
Vertex 8 -> B (degree 2)
Vertex 3 -> C (degree 3)
Vertex 6 -> D (degree 3)
Vertex 2 -> E (degree 3)
Vertex 4 -> F (degree 4)
Vertex 1 -> G (degree 5)
Vertex 5 -> H (degree 5)
Vertex 0 -> I (degree 6)

Now, we will look at each edge and count the triangles:
Triangles: 
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 0, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 1, 0>
<4, 0, 5>
<4, 1, 5>
<4, 1, 0>
<4, 8, 5>
<5, 3, 1>
<5, 3, 6>
<5, 4, 0>
<5, 4, 1>
<5, 4, 8>
<6, 3, 5>
<6, 3, 1>
<6, 0, 1>

Total number of triangles: [ 16 ]
