Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Then we relabel the vertices according to the sorting order. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections:
Vertices: 3, 1, 5, 4, 9, 8, 6, 7, 2, 0

Now we can count the triangles:
1. For the edge (2, 3):
   - Vertex 2 has fewer connections than Vertex 3.
   - Shared connection with Vertex 3: 2
   - Triangle found: <2, 3, 5>

2. For the edge (0, 2):
   - Vertex 0 has fewer connections than Vertex 2.
   - Shared connection with Vertex 2: 0
   - Triangle found: <0, 2, 6>

3. For the edge (0, 6):
   - Vertex 0 has fewer connections than Vertex 6.
   - Shared connection with Vertex 6: 2
   - Triangle found: <0, 2, 6>

4. For the edge (0, 7):
   - Vertex 0 has fewer connections than Vertex 7.
   - Shared connection with Vertex 7: 2
   - Triangle found: <0, 6, 7>

5. For the edge (0, 8):
   - Vertex 0 has fewer connections than Vertex 8.
   - Shared connection with Vertex 8: None

6. For the edge (1, 2):
   - Vertex 1 has fewer connections than Vertex 2.
   - Shared connection with Vertex 2: None

7. For the edge (3, 7):
   - Vertex 3 has fewer connections than Vertex 7.
   - Shared connection with Vertex 7: None

8. For the edge (4, 6):
   - Vertex 4 has fewer connections than Vertex 6.
   - Shared connection with Vertex 6: None

9. For the edge (5, 7):
   - Vertex 5 has fewer connections than Vertex 7.
   - Shared connection with Vertex 7: None

10. For the edge (5, 8):
   - Vertex 5 has fewer connections than Vertex 8.
   - Shared connection with Vertex 8: None

11. For the edge (8, 9):
   - Vertex 8 has fewer connections than Vertex 9.
   - Shared connection with Vertex 9: None

Total number of triangles: [5]
