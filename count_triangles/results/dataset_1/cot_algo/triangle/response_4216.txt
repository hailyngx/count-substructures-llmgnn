Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently:

Vertices sorted by degree (number of connections) in ascending order are: [1, 4, 6, 0, 7, 9, 5, 8, 3, 2].

Considering edges with vertices in order of increasing degree:
Edge (1, 5): No triangles.
Edge (4, 3): No triangles.
Edge (6, x): No more edges incident to vertex 6.
Edge (0, 7): Triangle <0, 7, 5>.
Edge (0, 8): Triangle <0, 8, 2>.
Edge (7, x): No more edges incident to vertex 7.
Edge (9, x): No more edges incident to vertex 9.
Edge (5, x): No more edges incident to vertex 5.
Edge (8, x): No more edges incident to vertex 8.
Edge (3, 2): Triangle <3, 2, 5>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
