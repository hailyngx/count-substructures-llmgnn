Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we relabel the nodes accordingly to make it easier to count triangles.

Nodes sorted by their degree:
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

Now, we calculate the triangles. Each edge will be checked based on the node with the lower label to ensure that each triangle is only counted once.

Number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
