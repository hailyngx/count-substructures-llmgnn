Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 4 (Degree: 0)
Node 2 (Degree: 1)
Node 5 (Degree: 2)
Node 7 (Degree: 2)
Node 1 (Degree: 4)
Node 3 (Degree: 4)
Node 6 (Degree: 4)
Node 8 (Degree: 5)
Node 9 (Degree: 6)
Node 0 (Degree: 7)

Considering the edges in the graph with the condition that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
<1, 0, 6>
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 9, 1>
<2, 1, 3>
<8, 0, 6>
<0, 9, 4>
<7, 0, 9>
<8, 0, 9>
<8, 5, 9>

There are a total of 12 triangles in this graph. Therefore, the output is [12].
