Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices: 3, 1, 9, 5, 1, 3, 6, 6, 5, 5
Edges: (1, 9), (1, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 8), (9, 5), (5, 3), (9, 6), (5, 3), (9, 5), (6, 6), (9, 5), (6, 8), (6, 7), (9, 6), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 9), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 8), (1, 9), (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 9), (9, 1), (9, 6)
