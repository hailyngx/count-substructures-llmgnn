Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled based on their number of connections:
Vertices in order of degree: 
1. 5 connections: 4
2. 4 connections: 0, 2, 6
3. 3 connections: 3, 7, 8
4. 1 connection: 1, 9

Based on the relabeling and the given edges, we observe the following triangles:
- <0, 4, 6>
- <2, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
