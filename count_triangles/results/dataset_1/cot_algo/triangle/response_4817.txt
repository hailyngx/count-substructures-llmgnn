Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Count the number of connections each vertex has:
   - Vertex 0: 2 connections
   - Vertex 1: 3 connections
   - Vertex 2: 5 connections
   - Vertex 3: 6 connections
   - Vertex 4: 5 connections
   - Vertex 5: 4 connections
   - Vertex 6: 3 connections
   - Vertex 7: 3 connections
   - Vertex 8: 4 connections
   - Vertex 9: 4 connections

2. Sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
   - Vertex 0: 2 connections
   - Vertex 1: 3 connections
   - Vertex 6: 3 connections
   - Vertex 7: 3 connections
   - Vertex 5: 4 connections
   - Vertex 8: 4 connections
   - Vertex 9: 4 connections
   - Vertex 2: 5 connections
   - Vertex 4: 5 connections
   - Vertex 3: 6 connections

3. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Vertex 0 (2) -> A
   - Vertex 1 (3) -> B
   - Vertex 6 (3) -> C
   - Vertex 7 (3) -> D
   - Vertex 5 (4) -> E
   - Vertex 8 (4) -> F
   - Vertex 9 (4) -> G
   - Vertex 2 (5) -> H
   - Vertex 4 (5) -> I
   - Vertex 3 (6) -> J

4. List the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - (A, I)
   - (A, E)
   - (B, J)
   - (B, E)
   - (C, J)
   - (D, H)
   - (D, I)

5. Count the triangles formed by shared connections:
   - <A, E, I>
   - <B, E, J>
   - <D, H, I>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
