Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0: Degree 1
- Node 3: Degree 0
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 6
- Node 6: Degree 5
- Node 7: Degree 6

We will now count the triangles:
- For edge (0, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (1, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (1, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 6> found.
- For edge (1, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (1, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (1, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (2, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (2, 4): Triangle <1, 2, 4> found.
- For edge (2, 7): Triangle <1, 2, 7> found.
- For edge (2, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (4, 0): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (4, 1): Triangle <1, 4, 6> found.
- For edge (4, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 4> found.
- For edge (4, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (4, 6): Triangle <1, 4, 6> found.
- For edge (4, 7): Triangle <1, 4, 7> found.
- For edge (5, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (5, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (5, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (6, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (6, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 6> found.
- For edge (6, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (6, 7): Triangle <1, 6, 7> found.
- For edge (6, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (7, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (7, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 7> found.
- For edge (7, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 7> found.
- For edge (7, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (7, 6): Triangle <1, 6, 7> found.
- For edge (7, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (7, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (8, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (8, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (8, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (9, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (9, 7): No triangles can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>.
