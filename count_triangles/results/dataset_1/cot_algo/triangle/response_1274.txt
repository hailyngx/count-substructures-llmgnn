Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree of connections, the new ordering is: 
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 4: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): Shared connections: 3. Triangle <0, 2, 3>.
- Edge (0, 3): Shared connections: 3. Triangle <0, 3, 1>.
- Edge (0, 4): Shared connections: 1. No triangles.
- Edge (1, 3): Shared connections: 3. Triangle <1, 3, 0>.
- Edge (1, 6): Shared connections: 1. No triangles.
- Edge (1, 7): Shared connections: 2. No triangles.
- Edge (2, 3): Shared connections: 3. Triangle <2, 3, 0>.
- Edge (2, 5): Shared connections: 2. No triangles.
- Edge (3, 0): Shared connections: 3. Triangle <3, 0, 2>.
- Edge (3, 1): Shared connections: 3. Triangle <3, 1, 0>.
- Edge (3, 7): Shared connections: 2. No triangles.
- Edge (5, 4): Shared connections: 1. No triangles.
- Edge (5, 8): Shared connections: 2. No triangles.
- Edge (5, 9): Shared connections: 3. Triangle <5, 9, 8>.
- Edge (6, 1): Shared connections: 1. No triangles.
- Edge (8, 6): Shared connections: 1. No triangles.
- Edge (8, 9): Shared connections: 3. Triangle <8, 9, 5>.
- Edge (9, 7): Shared connections: 2. No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 1>, <1, 3, 0>, <2, 3, 0>, <5, 9, 8>, <8, 9, 5>.
