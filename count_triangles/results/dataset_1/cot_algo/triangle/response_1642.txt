Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are:
- Node 1: 9 connections
- Node 2: 9 connections
- Node 6: 9 connections
- Node 8: 8 connections
- Node 0: 7 connections
- Node 5: 7 connections
- Node 4: 6 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph.
By following the method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find that there are 5 triangles in total.

The identified triangles are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
