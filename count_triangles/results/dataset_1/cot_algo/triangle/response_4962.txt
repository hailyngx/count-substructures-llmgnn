Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabel them accordingly.

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections

Based on the sorted list, the new labels for the nodes will be:
New label - Original label
0 - 5
1 - 1
2 - 4
3 - 0
4 - 2
5 - 6
6 - 9
7 - 7
8 - 3
9 - 8

Now, let's check the edges for triangles to count. Since we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will exclude (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 6), and (8, 7) as these are not eligible.

Let's count the triangles found:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
3. Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
