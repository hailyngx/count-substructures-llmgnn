Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling for the vertices will be:
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections
- Node 4: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles: 
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 6, 4>
- <0, 5, 4>
- <0, 5, 3>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <0, 4, 2>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <5, 4, 3>
- <5, 7, 6>
- <4, 2, 9>
- <4, 2, 6>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <2, 6, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [14].
