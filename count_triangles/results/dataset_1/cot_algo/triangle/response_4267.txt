Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labels are as follows:
Vertices: [7, 0, 9, 1, 5, 6, 4, 2, 8, 3]

Now, we will check the edges starting from the vertex with the lower label:
Checking edge (0, 2):
Vertex 0 has connections with vertices [2, 8]
Vertex 2 has connections with vertices [0, 3, 7]
Shared connections for edge (0, 2) are [0, 2], forming a triangle with vertex 8.

Checking edge (0, 8):
Vertex 0 has connections with vertices [2, 8]
Vertex 8 has connections with vertices [0, 3, 7]
Shared connections for edge (0, 8) are [0, 8], forming a triangle with vertex 2.

Checking edge (1, 3):
Vertex 1 has connections with vertices [3, 4, 5]
Vertex 3 has connections with vertices [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]
Shared connections for edge (1, 3) are [1, 3], forming a triangle with vertices 4 and 8.

Checking edge (1, 4):
Vertex 1 has connections with vertices [3, 4, 5]
Vertex 4 has connections with vertices [1, 3, 5, 6]
Shared connections for edge (1, 4) are [1, 4], forming a triangle with vertices 3 and 5.

Checking edge (1, 5):
Vertex 1 has connections with vertices [3, 4, 5]
Vertex 5 has connections with vertices [1, 4, 9]
Shared connections for edge (1, 5) are [1, 5], forming a triangle with vertex 4.

The total number of triangles is [4].
The unique triangles are <8, 0, 2>, <2, 0, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, and <1, 4, 5>.
