Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections

Now, we will examine each edge considering the order of vertices based on their degrees:

Checking edge (1, 2): Both vertices have the same degree, so we proceed.
   - They share a connection with node 4, forming a triangle <1, 2, 4>.

Checking edge (2, 6): Node 2 has fewer connections than node 6, so we proceed.
   - They share connections with nodes 1 and 7, forming triangles <1, 2, 6> and <2, 6, 7>.

Checking edge (3, 6): Node 3 has fewer connections than node 6, so we proceed.
   - They share a connection with node 2, forming a triangle <2, 3, 6>.

Checking edge (4, 1): Node 4 has fewer connections than node 1, so we proceed.
   - They share a connection with node 5, forming a triangle <1, 4, 5>.

Checking edge (5, 1): Node 5 has fewer connections than node 1, so we proceed.
   - They share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <1, 5, 9>.

Checking edge (6, 2): Both vertices have the same degree, so we proceed.
   - They share connections with nodes 1 and 7, forming triangles <1, 2, 6> and <2, 6, 7>.

Checking edge (6, 3): Node 6 has more connections than node 3, so we skip this edge.

Checking edge (6, 7): Node 6 has more connections than node 7, so we skip this edge.

Checking edge (7, 2): Node 7 has fewer connections than node 2, so we proceed.
   - They share a connection with node 6, forming a triangle <2, 6, 7>.

Checking edge (7, 6): Node 7 has fewer connections than node 6, so we proceed.
   - They share a connection with node 2, forming a triangle <2, 6, 7>.

Checking edge (8, 2): Node 8 has fewer connections than node 2, so we proceed.
   - They share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <2, 8, 9>.

Checking edge (8, 9): Node 8 has fewer connections than node 9, so we proceed.
   - They share a connection with node 2, forming a triangle <2, 8, 9>.

Checking edge (9, 5): Node 9 has fewer connections than node 5, so we proceed.
   - They share a connection with node 1, forming a triangle <1, 5, 9>.

Checking edge (9, 8): Node 9 has more connections than node 8, so we skip this edge.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are: <1, 2, 4>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 8, 9>.
