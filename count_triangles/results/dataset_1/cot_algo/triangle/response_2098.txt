Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 0 has a degree of 2.
- Node 1 has a degree of 0.
- Node 2 has a degree of 2.
- Node 3 has a degree of 4.
- Node 4 has a degree of 3.
- Node 5 has a degree of 1.
- Node 6 has a degree of 2.
- Node 7 has a degree of 4.
- Node 8 has a degree of 4.
- Node 9 has a degree of 3.

After sorting the edges based on the new labeling, we consider the following edges:
- (1, 5), (0, 1), (0, 4), (2, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 9)

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the shared connections between the vertices of each edge:
- Triangle <3, 7, 8>
- Triangle <3, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
