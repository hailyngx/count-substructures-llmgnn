Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are: 
0(2), 1(1), 5(3), 8(2), 4(2), 7(4), 2(4), 6(6), 3(7), 9(9)

Considering each edge, we find the following triangles: 
- <1, 9, 0>
- <2, 6, 3>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <3, 7, 4>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 8, 6>
- <3, 8, 7>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <6, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
