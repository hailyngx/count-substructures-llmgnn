Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first rank the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 0 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 8: 0 connections
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

For edge (0, 2):
- Nodes 0 and 2 do not form a triangle with any other node.

For edge (2, 3):
- Node 2 connects to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 3 connects to nodes 2 and 4.
- Shared connection: Node 2 and 3 form a triangle with node 4.

For edge (3, 4):
- Nodes 3 and 4 do not form a triangle with any other node.

For edge (5, 6):
- Nodes 5 and 6 do not form a triangle with any other node.

For edge (5, 9):
- Nodes 5 and 9 do not form a triangle with any other node.

For edge (6, 7):
- Nodes 6 and 7 do not form a triangle with any other node.

For edge (7, 9):
- Nodes 7 and 9 do not form a triangle with any other node.

Total number of triangles: [1]

Unique triangles found: <3, 2, 4>
