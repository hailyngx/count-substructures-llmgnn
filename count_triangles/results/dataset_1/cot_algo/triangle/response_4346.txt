Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each vertex has:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 1 connection
- Vertex 6: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order:
- Vertex 1 -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 5 -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 7 -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 8 -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 4 -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 0 -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 3 -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 6 -> Vertex 7

Next, we will list the edges that we will consider based on the degree-based ordering:
- (1, 3) - Vertex 0 is less than Vertex 6
- (1, 5) - Not considered
- (1, 0) - Not considered
- (3, 4) - Vertex 6 is less than Vertex 4
- (3, 6) - Vertex 6 is less than Vertex 7
- (3, 7) - Vertex 6 is less than Vertex 7
- (4, 0) - Vertex 4 is less than Vertex 5
- (4, 5) - Vertex 4 is less than Vertex 1

Now, we count the triangles:
- From (3, 4): 3 shares 0 as a connection, so <3, 4, 0>
- From (3, 6): 3 shares 0 and 7 as connections, so <3, 6, 0> and <3, 6, 7>
- From (4, 0): 4 shares 3 as a connection, so <4, 0, 3>

Therefore, we have found 3 unique triangles in this graph. The answer is [3].
