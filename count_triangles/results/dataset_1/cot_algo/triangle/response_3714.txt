Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

- Node 9 has degree 1
- Nodes 1, 5, and 8 have degree 2
- Nodes 0 and 6 have degree 4
- Nodes 3 and 7 have degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 6
- Node 4 has degree 7

Next, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 9 (degree 1) will be relabeled as 0
- Nodes 1, 5, and 8 (degree 2) will be relabeled as 1, 2, and 3 respectively
- Nodes 0 and 6 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 4 and 5 respectively
- Nodes 3 and 7 (degree 5) will be relabeled as 6 and 7 respectively
- Node 2 (degree 6) will be relabeled as 8
- Node 4 (degree 7) will be relabeled as 9

The edges in the graph are now:
(4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4)

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the sorted labels and shared connections:

- Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: 
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
