Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order and re-label them accordingly. 

The degrees of the vertices are:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 9: 2 connections

Sorted by degree in ascending order:
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections

Now, we will list the triangles by checking shared connections between vertices starting from the lowest degree vertices:

1. Triangles involving node 5:
   - No triangles as it only has 1 connection.

2. Triangles involving node 8:
   - No triangles as it only has 1 connection.

3. Triangles involving node 6:
   - No triangles involving node 6.

4. Triangles involving node 7:
   - No triangles involving node 7.

5. Triangles involving node 2:
   - No triangles involving node 2.

6. Triangles involving node 9:
   - No triangles involving node 9.

7. Triangles involving node 0:
   - No triangle involving node 0.

8. Triangles involving node 1:
   - <0, 1, 3>

9. Triangles involving node 3:
   - No additional triangles involving node 3.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 1, 3>.
