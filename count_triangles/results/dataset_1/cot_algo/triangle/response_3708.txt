Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their degrees are:
Vertex 3 (degree 1)
Vertex 9 (degree 1)
Vertex 1 (degree 0)
Vertex 0 (degree 3)
Vertex 6 (degree 2)
Vertex 4 (degree 3)
Vertex 8 (degree 2)
Vertex 5 (degree 3)
Vertex 2 (degree 3)
Vertex 7 (degree 4)

Based on the sorted vertices, we can count the number of triangles. The triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 5>
<4, 5, 7>
<7, 5, 0>
<7, 5, 8>
<7, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
