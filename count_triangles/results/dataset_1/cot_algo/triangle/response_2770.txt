Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 5 connections
- Vertex 8: 4 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

Checking the edges:
1. Edge (0, 2): Both vertices have fewer connections than 4. Form a triangle with shared connection 6. (0, 2, 6)
2. Edge (0, 5): Both vertices have fewer connections than 4. Form a triangle with shared connection 7. (0, 5, 7)
3. Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than 5. Form a triangle with shared connection 2. (0, 2, 6)
4. Edge (1, 8): Both vertices have fewer connections than 4. No triangle formed.
5. Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than 6. Form a triangle with shared connection 0. (0, 2, 6)
6. Edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 has fewer connections than 6. Form a triangle with shared connection 7. (3, 6, 7)
7. Edge (3, 7): Both vertices have fewer connections than 6. Form a triangle with shared connections 6 and 9. (3, 6, 7) and (3, 7, 9)
8. Edge (3, 9): Both vertices have fewer connections than 6. Form a triangle with shared connection 7. (3, 7, 9)
9. Edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than 7. Form a triangle with shared connections 9. (4, 7, 9)
10. Edge (4, 9): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than 7. Form a triangle with shared connection 7. (4, 7, 9)
11. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has fewer connections than 7. Form a triangle with shared connections 0. (0, 5, 7)
12. Edge (6, 0): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than 6. Form a triangle with shared connection 2. (0, 2, 6)
13. Edge (6, 2): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than 6. Form a triangle with shared connection 0. (0, 2, 6)
14. Edge (6, 3): Vertex 3 has fewer connections than 6. Form a triangle with shared connection 7. (3, 6, 7)
15. Edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 has more connections than 8. No triangle formed.
16. Edge (7, 3): Vertex 3 has fewer connections than 7. Form a triangle with shared connections 6. (3, 6, 7)
17. Edge (7, 4): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than 7. Form a triangle with shared connection 9. (4, 7, 9)
18. Edge (7, 5): Vertex 5 has fewer connections than 7. Form a triangle with shared connection 0. (0, 5, 7)
19. Edge (7, 8): Vertex 7 has more connections than 8. No triangle formed.
20. Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has more connections than 9. No triangle formed.
21. Edge (8, 1): Both vertices have fewer connections than 4. No triangle formed.
22. Edge (8, 6): Vertex 6 has more connections than 8. No triangle formed.
23. Edge (8, 7): Vertex 7 has more connections than 8. No triangle formed.
24. Edge (9, 3): Vertex 3 has fewer connections than 9. Form a triangle with shared connection 7. (3, 7, 9)
25. Edge (9, 4): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than 9. Form a triangle with shared connection 7. (4, 7, 9)
26. Edge (9, 7): Vertex 7 has more connections than 9. No triangle formed.

The total number of triangles is [7] inside brackets.
The unique triangles found are:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <3, 6, 7>
4. <3, 7, 9>
5. <4, 7, 9>
