Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the relabeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 0 (degree 2) -> relabeled to node 0
- Node 7 (degree 2) -> relabeled to node 1
- Node 8 (degree 2) -> relabeled to node 2
- Node 6 (degree 3) -> relabeled to node 3
- Node 4 (degree 4) -> relabeled to node 4
- Node 1 (degree 5) -> relabeled to node 5
- Node 3 (degree 5) -> relabeled to node 6
- Node 2 (degree 5) -> relabeled to node 7
- Node 5 (degree 6) -> relabeled to node 8
- Node 9 (degree 6) -> relabeled to node 9

Using the degree-based ordering method, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
1. <5, 0, 3>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <1, 9, 6>
4. <2, 1, 9>
5. <2, 4, 5>
6. <2, 4, 6>
7. <5, 4, 0>
8. <5, 4, 3>
9. <5, 9, 6>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
