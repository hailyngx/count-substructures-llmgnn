Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are:  
Node 9: 0 connections  
Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 2: 1 connection  
Node 5: 1 connection  
Node 4: 2 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 6: 4 connections  
Node 3: 5 connections  
Node 0: 6 connections  
Node 7: 7 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:
- For edge (0, 3): Node 0 (degree 6) has Node 3 (degree 5) as a connection. They share connections with Node 7 and form a triangle <0, 3, 7>.
- For edge (0, 7): Node 0 (degree 6) has Node 7 (degree 7) as a connection. They share connections with Node 3 and also form a triangle <0, 7, 3>.
- For edge (0, 8): Node 0 (degree 6) has Node 8 (degree 3) as a connection. They do not form a triangle.
- For edge (1, 5): Node 1 (degree 1) has Node 5 (degree 1) as a connection. They do not form a triangle.
- For edge (1, 7): Node 1 (degree 1) has Node 7 (degree 7) as a connection. They do not form a triangle.
- For edge (2, 3): Node 2 (degree 1) has Node 3 (degree 5) as a connection. They do not form a triangle.
- For edge (3, 6): Node 3 (degree 5) has Node 6 (degree 4) as a connection. They share connections with Node 4 and form a triangle <3, 6, 4>.
- For edge (3, 6): Node 3 (degree 5) has Node 6 (degree 4) as a connection. They share connections with Node 5 and form a triangle <3, 6, 5>.
- For the rest of the edges, no more triangles can be found with the given method due to the ordering. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are:  
<0, 3, 7>  
<3, 6, 4>  
<3, 6, 5>
