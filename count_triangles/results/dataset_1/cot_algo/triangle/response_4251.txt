Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Vertex 4 -> Degree 0\
Vertex 6 -> Degree 2\
Vertex 0 -> Degree 3\
Vertex 9 -> Degree 3\
Vertex 1 -> Degree 4\
Vertex 3 -> Degree 4\
Vertex 7 -> Degree 4\
Vertex 5 -> Degree 5\
Vertex 2 -> Degree 5\
Vertex 8 -> Degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the vertex with lower label has fewer connections, we find the triangles in the graph to be as follows:
Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 8, 9>
