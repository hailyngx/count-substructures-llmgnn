Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Based on the sorted list, let's denote the nodes as follows:
Node 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 0, 8, 1, 3, 5

Now, we will examine each edge, starting with the lowest labeled vertex:

- Edge (0, 3):
Node 0 and Node 3 have a common connection with Node 5, forming a triangle <0, 3, 5>.

- Edge (0, 5):
Node 0 and Node 5 have a common connection with Node 3, forming a triangle <0, 5, 3>.

- Edge (1, 2):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (1, 6):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (1, 7):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (2, 1):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (3, 0):
Already counted.

- Edge (3, 5):
Node 3 and Node 5 have a common connection with Node 0, forming a triangle <3, 5, 0>.

- Edge (3, 8):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (4, 5):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (4, 9):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (5, 0):
Already counted.

- Edge (5, 3):
Already counted.

- Edge (5, 4):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (5, 9):
Node 5 and Node 9 have a common connection with Node 4, forming a triangle <5, 9, 4>.

- Edge (6, 1):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (6, 8):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (7, 1):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (7, 8):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (8, 3):
Already counted.

- Edge (8, 6):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (8, 7):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (9, 4):
No triangle formed.

- Edge (9, 5):
Already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 0>, <5, 9, 4>.
