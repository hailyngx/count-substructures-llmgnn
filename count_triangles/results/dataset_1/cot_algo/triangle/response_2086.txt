Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

- Vertex 1 (0): 4 connections
- Vertex 2 (2): 2 connections
- Vertex 3 (3): 4 connections
- Vertex 4 (4): 3 connections
- Vertex 5 (5): 5 connections
- Vertex 6 (6): 2 connections
- Vertex 7 (7): 2 connections
- Vertex 8 (8): 2 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

- Vertex 1 (2): 2 connections
- Vertex 2 (6): 2 connections
- Vertex 3 (7): 2 connections
- Vertex 4 (8): 2 connections
- Vertex 5 (3): 4 connections
- Vertex 6 (0): 4 connections
- Vertex 7 (4): 3 connections
- Vertex 8 (5): 5 connections

Now, we will identify triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Checking the sorted edges:
- (2, 6) -> No triangle
- (2, 7) -> No triangle
- (2, 8) -> No triangle
- (6, 7) -> No triangle
- (6, 8) -> No triangle
- (7, 8) -> No triangle
- (3, 7) -> No triangle
- (3, 8) -> No triangle
- (0, 6) -> No triangle
- (0, 7) -> No triangle
- (0, 8) -> No triangle
- (4, 8) -> No triangle
- (5, 8) -> <3, 5, 8> is a triangle
- (5, 3) -> No triangle
- (5, 7) -> No triangle
- (5, 0) -> No triangle
- (5, 2) -> No triangle
- (6, 4) -> No triangle
- (4, 5) -> No triangle
- (4, 6) -> No triangle
- (0, 5) -> No triangle
- (3, 5) -> No triangle
- (2, 5) -> No triangle
- (0, 3) -> No triangle

Therefore, there is only 1 triangle: <3, 5, 8>. 

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
