Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 1 has degree 7
- Vertex 2 has degree 2
- Vertex 3 has degree 6
- Vertex 4 has degree 3
- Vertex 5 has degree 3
- Vertex 6 has degree 4
- Vertex 7 has degree 5
- Vertex 8 has degree 4
- Vertex 9 has degree 6

Now, we relabel the vertices as follows:
- Vertex 0 → 2
- Vertex 1 → 4
- Vertex 2 → 3
- Vertex 3 → 5
- Vertex 4 → 0
- Vertex 5 → 1
- Vertex 6 → 6
- Vertex 7 → 3
- Vertex 8 → 7
- Vertex 9 → 7

Now, we follow the edges according to the relabeling:
- Edge (0, 6): Both 0 and 6 have lower degrees, forming a triangle with node 3. Triangle: <0, 3, 6>
- Edge (0, 7): Node 0 has a lower degree, forming a triangle with nodes 3 and 4. Triangle: <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (1, 3): Both 1 and 3 have higher degrees, skip.
- Edge (1, 4): Node 1 has a lower degree, forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 5. Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
- Edge (1, 5): Node 1 has a lower degree, forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 8. Triangle: <0, 1, 5>
- Remaining edges have at least one node with a higher degree, so we stop here.
