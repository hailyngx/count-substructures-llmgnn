Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex in the given graph:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 8
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 4

According to the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by degree in increasing order:
Nodes: 1, 4, 5, 0, 8, 9, 6, 2, 3, 7

Now, we will label the nodes:
- Node 1 (degree 2) -> label 1
- Node 4 (degree 2) -> label 2
- Node 5 (degree 2) -> label 3
- Node 0 (degree 3) -> label 4
- Node 8 (degree 4) -> label 5
- Node 9 (degree 4) -> label 6
- Node 6 (degree 4) -> label 7
- Node 2 (degree 4) -> label 8
- Node 3 (degree 4) -> label 9
- Node 7 (degree 8) -> label 10

Next, we will list the triangles based on the shared connections:
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<8, 9, 6>
<8, 9, 7>
<7, 6, 4>
<7, 6, 8>
<7, 6, 3>

Calculating the total number of triangles gives us: [12]
