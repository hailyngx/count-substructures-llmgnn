Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 0: 4 edges
Node 1: 3 edges
Node 2: 3 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 4: 3 edges
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 6: 3 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 9: 5 edges

Next, we'll relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 1: 0 edges
Node 2: 3 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 4: 3 edges
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 6: 3 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 10: 5 edges

Now, we'll examine each edge and count the triangles:
