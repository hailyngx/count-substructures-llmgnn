Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to this graph:

    Vertex 3: degree 1
    Vertex 7: degree 2
    Vertex 8: degree 2
    Vertex 9: degree 2
    Vertex 1: degree 3
    Vertex 2: degree 3
    Vertex 5: degree 5
    Vertex 4: degree 5
    Vertex 6: degree 7
    Vertex 0: degree 7

Following the method, we start with the edge (0, 1) because vertex 0 has a lower label and fewer connections. 
This edge forms a triangle with vertex 2. 
Moving on to the next edge, we find that (0, 2) also forms a triangle with vertex 5. 
Continuing this process, all the triangles within the graph are accounted for.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [14] and they are: 
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, 
<1, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, 
<6, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 0, 1>, <0, 5, 2>.
