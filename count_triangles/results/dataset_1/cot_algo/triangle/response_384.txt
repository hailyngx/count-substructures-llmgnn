Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have the following order: 

Vertices: 3, 1, 7, 8, 5, 0, 2, 9, 6, 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we look at each edge in the graph to count the number of triangles. The shared connections between the two vertices of each edge form triangles. 

Calculating the triangles:
- Edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle with node 2. Triangle: <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (0, 5): No triangles as both nodes have higher degree vertices to form triangles with.
- Edge (0, 8): No triangles for the same reason as above.
- Edge (1, 4): No triangles for the same reason.
- Edge (2, 4): No triangles as they have higher degree vertices.
- Edge (2, 6): No triangles for the same reason.
- Edge (3, 6): No triangles for the same reason.
- Edge (4, 0): No new triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 1): No new triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 2): No new triangles.
- Edge (4, 9): No new triangles.
- Edge (5, 0): No new triangles.
- Edge (5, 6): No new triangles.
- Edge (5, 8): No new triangles.
- Edge (6, 2): No new triangles.
- Edge (6, 3): No new triangles.
- Edge (6, 5): No new triangles.
- Edge (6, 9): No new triangles.
- Edge (7, 8): No new triangles.
- Edge (7, 9): No new triangles.
- Edge (8, 0): No new triangles.
- Edge (8, 5): No new triangles.
- Edge (8, 7): No new triangles.
- Edge (9, 4): No new triangles.
- Edge (9, 6): No new triangles.

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 4>
