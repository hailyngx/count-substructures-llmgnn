Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are: 6, 0, 9, 2, 4, 1, 8, 3, 7, 5.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
- <3, 7, 8>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <3, 7, 1>
- <3, 7, 4>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
