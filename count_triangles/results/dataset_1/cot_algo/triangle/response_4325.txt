Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled based on their number of connections:
Node 1 (degree 0): 1
Node 3 (degree 0): 2
Node 8 (degree 0): 3
Node 4 (degree 2): 4
Node 5 (degree 4): 5
Node 9 (degree 4): 6
Node 0 (degree 4): 7
Node 2 (degree 4): 8
Node 6 (degree 4): 9
Node 7 (degree 4): 10

Calculating the triangles based on the connections, we find the following unique triangles: 
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
