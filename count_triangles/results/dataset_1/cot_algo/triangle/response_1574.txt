Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Node 3 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 4 and 9 each have 1 connection.
- Nodes 5 and 7 each have 2 connections.
- Nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 9 each have 3 connections.
- Nodes 1 and 3 each have 4 connections.
- Node 6 has the most connections with 5.

Relabeling the nodes based on the number of connections:
- Node 3 is now A.
- Nodes 4 and 9 are now B and C.
- Nodes 5 and 7 are now D and E.
- Nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 9 are now F, G, H, I, and J.
- Nodes 1 and 3 are now K and L.
- Node 6 is now M.

With these new labels, the edges are:
(B, C) (D, E) (D, J) (F, K) (F, I) (F, L) (G, F) (H, F) (I, F) (I, L) (K, F) (K, L) (L, K) (M, D) (M, F) (M, I) (M, L)

Counting the triangles formed by these edges yields:
- Number of triangles: [8]
- Unique triangles: <F, I, L> <F, K, L> <F, K, I> <F, M, I> <F, M, L> <I, M, L> <K, M, L> <D, M, I>
