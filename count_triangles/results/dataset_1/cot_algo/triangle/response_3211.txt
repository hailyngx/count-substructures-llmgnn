Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After analyzing the graph based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows:  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 4: 2 connections  
Node 7: 2 connections  
Node 9: 2 connections  
Node 0: 7 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 6: 7 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  

Following the method described, the triangles and their corresponding vertices are counted as follows:
- Node 0 (7 connections) is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.  
  - <0, 2, 6>
- Node 2 (4 connections) is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.  
  - No triangles found.
- Node 6 (7 connections) is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9.  
  - <0, 6, 9>
- Node 8 (3 connections) is connected to nodes 0 and 5.  
  - No triangles found.
- Node 5 (4 connections) is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.  
  - No triangles found.
- Node 1 (3 connections) is connected to nodes 4 and 7.  
  - No triangles found.
- Node 7 (2 connections) is connected to node 1.  
  - No triangles found.
- Node 3 (1 connection) is connected to node 6.  
  - No triangles found.
- Node 4 (2 connections) is connected to node 1.  
  - No triangles found.
- Node 9 (2 connections) is connected to node 0.  
  - No triangles found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6> and <0, 6, 9>.
