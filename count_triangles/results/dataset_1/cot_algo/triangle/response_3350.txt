Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, the sorted vertices based on their degree are: 

Vertices: 7(0), 3(3), 6(6), 2(2), 4(4), 5(5), 9(9), 1(1), 8(8)

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

1. (1, 3) and (3, 5) share vertex 1: Triangle <1, 3, 5>
2. (1, 4) and (4, 2) share vertex 1: Triangle <1, 2, 4>
3. (1, 8) and (8, 6) don't share any vertex, no triangle formed.
4. (1, 9) and (9, 0) share vertex 1: Triangle <0, 1, 9>
5. (1, 9) and (9, 8) share vertex 1: Triangle <1, 8, 9>
6. (3, 5) and (5, 4) share vertex 3: Triangle <3, 4, 5>
7. (4, 5) and (5, 8) share vertex 5: Triangle <4, 5, 8>
8. (5, 8) and (8, 6) share vertex 8: Triangle <5, 6, 8>
9. (8, 1) and (1, 0) share vertex 1: Triangle <0, 1, 8>
10. (8, 1) and (1, 2) share vertex 1: Triangle <1, 2, 8>
11. (8, 1) and (1, 9) share vertex 1: Triangle <1, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
