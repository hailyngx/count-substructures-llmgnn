Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Reordering the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 1: 7 connections
Node 4: 7 connections

Now we will iterate through the edges in increasing order of the nodes:
Edge (0, 4): Shared connections with node 5. Triangle <0, 4, 5>.
Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
Edge (1, 2): Shared connections with node 5. Triangle <1, 2, 5>.
Edge (1, 3): Shared connections with nodes 5 and 9. Triangles <1, 3, 5> and <1, 3, 9>.
Edge (1, 5): Shared connections with nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8. Triangles <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 4>, and <1, 5, 8>.
Edge (1, 7): Shared connection with node 8. Triangle <1, 7, 8>.
Edge (1, 9): Shared connection with node 3. Triangle <1, 9, 3>.
Edge (2, 4): Shared connection with node 5. Triangle <2, 4, 5>.
Edge (2, 5): Shared connections with nodes 1 and 4. Triangles <2, 5, 1> and <2, 5, 4>.
