Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree, which is the number of connections each vertex has.

The sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees is as follows:
- Vertex 3: Degree 0
- Vertex 0: Degree 1
- Vertex 4: Degree 1
- Vertex 6: Degree 2
- Vertex 9: Degree 2
- Vertex 5: Degree 4
- Vertex 7: Degree 3
- Vertex 1: Degree 4
- Vertex 8: Degree 4
- Vertex 2: Degree 6

Now, we will examine each edge based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Considering the edges in the specified order, the triangles in the graph are:
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <2, 6, 5>
- <2, 6, 0>
- <2, 8, 1>
- <2, 8, 7>
- <2, 8, 9>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <1, 8, 7>
- <1, 9, 7>
- <2, 8, 7>
- <2, 9, 7>
- <5, 9, 7>

Count of triangles: [19]
