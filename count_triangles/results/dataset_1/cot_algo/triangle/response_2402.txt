Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 4: 0 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Nodes 7 and 0: 2 connections
- Nodes 5 and 9: 3 connections
- Nodes 8 and 6: 4 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 2: 6 connections

Now, we will check the edges based on the degree-based ordering:

1. Edge (0, 2): Both nodes have 2 connections, so we proceed.
2. Edge (0, 5): Node 0 has 2 connections while Node 5 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
3. Edge (0, 6): Node 0 has 2 connections while Node 6 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
4. Edge (1, 3): Both nodes have 1 connection, so we proceed.
5. Edge (1, 5): Both nodes have 1 connection, so we proceed.
6. Edge (2, 0): Both nodes have 2 connections, so we proceed.
7. Edge (2, 3): Node 2 has 2 connections while Node 3 has 5 connections, so we proceed.
8. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 has 2 connections while Node 6 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
9. Edge (2, 9): Node 2 has 2 connections while Node 9 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
10. Edge (3, 1): Both nodes have 1 connection, so we proceed.
11. Edge (3, 2): Node 2 has 2 connections while Node 3 has 5 connections, so we proceed.
12. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 has 5 connections while Node 8 has 4 connections, so we stop (node with lower label has more connections).
13. Edge (5, 0): Node 0 has 2 connections while Node 5 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
14. Edge (5, 1): Both nodes have 1 connection, so we proceed.
15. Edge (5, 7): Node 5 has 3 connections while Node 7 has 2 connections, so we proceed.
16. Edge (6, 0): Node 0 has 2 connections while Node 6 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
17. Edge (6, 2): Node 2 has 2 connections while Node 6 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
18. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 has 4 connections while Node 7 has 2 connections, so we stop (node with lower label has more connections).
19. Edge (7, 5): Node 5 has 3 connections while Node 7 has 2 connections, so we proceed.
20. Edge (7, 6): Node 6 has 4 connections while Node 7 has 2 connections, so we stop (node with lower label has more connections).
21. Edge (7, 8): Node 7 has 2 connections while Node 8 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
22. Edge (8, 3): Node 3 has 5 connections while Node 8 has 4 connections, so we stop (node with lower label has more connections).
23. Edge (8, 7): Node 7 has 2 connections while Node 8 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
24. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 has 4 connections while Node 9 has 3 connections, so we stop (node with lower label has more connections).
25. Edge (9, 2): Node 2 has 2 connections while Node 9 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
26. Edge (9, 8): Node 8 has 4 connections while Node 9 has 3 connections, so we stop (node with lower label has more connections).
