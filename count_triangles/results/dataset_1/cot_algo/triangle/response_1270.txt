Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 

Vertex 9: 0 connections
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertices 3 and 8: 2 connections
Vertices 1, 2, 5, and 6: 5 connections
Vertices 0 and 7: 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles.

1. For edge (0, 1):
   - Shared connections: 5
   - Triangle: <0, 1, 5>

2. For edge (0, 5):
   - Shared connections: 0
   (None)

3. For edge (0, 6):
   - Shared connections: 0
   (None)

4. For edge (1, 5):
   - Shared connections: 5
   - Triangle: <1, 0, 5>

5. For edge (1, 6):
   - Shared connections: 5
   - Triangle: <1, 0, 6>

6. For edge (2, 1):
   - Shared connections: 5
   - Triangle: <2, 1, 0>

7. For edge (2, 5):
   - Shared connections: 2
   (None)

8. For edge (2, 7):
   - Shared connections: 2
   (None)

9. For edge (3, 1):
   - Shared connections: 5
   - Triangle: <3, 1, 0>

10. For edge (3, 6):
   - Shared connections: 1
   (None)

11. For edge (4, 2):
   - Shared connections: 0
   (None)

12. For edge (5, 7):
   - Shared connections: 2
   (None)

13. For edge (5, 8):
   - Shared connections: 0
   (None)

14. For edge (6, 7):
   - Shared connections: 5
   - Triangle: <6, 1, 0>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph, which are <0, 1, 5>, <1, 0, 6>, <2, 1, 0>.
