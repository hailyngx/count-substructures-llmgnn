Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
2, 4, 8, 9, 0, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7.

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangle <0, 1, 3>
Triangle <0, 1, 5>
Triangle <0, 5, 7>
Triangle <1, 3, 5>
Triangle <1, 5, 7>
Triangle <5, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
