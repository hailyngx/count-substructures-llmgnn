Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree of connectivity, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found in the graph are as follows: 
- <0, 7, 9>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
