Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, we relabel the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
- Node 1 (degree 1) -> relabeled as Node 0
- Node 6 (degree 1) -> relabeled as Node 1
- Node 4 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 2
- Node 5 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 3
- Node 8 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 4
- Node 2 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Node 5
- Node 3 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Node 6
- Node 7 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Node 7
- Node 0 (degree 4) -> relabeled as Node 8
- Node 9 (degree 4) -> relabeled as Node 9

After relabeling, the edges become:
(0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
(1, 0)
(2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8)
(3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7)
(5, 0) (5, 3)
(6, 0)
(7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3)
(8, 4) (8, 9)
(9, 4) (9, 7)

Now, we will count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method:
Triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 0>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 8, 9>
