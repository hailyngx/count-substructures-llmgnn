Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have the following order:
Nodes: 7, 0, 4, 8, 5, 1, 2, 9, 6, 3

Now, let's identify the triangles:

- Triangle <1, 5, 6>
- Triangle <1, 5, 2>
- Triangle <1, 8, 2>
- Triangle <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle <3, 0, 9>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <5, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
