Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices by degree:
0: 3 connections
7: 2 connections
4: 3 connections
2: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
1: 7 connections
6: 7 connections
3: 7 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0: 0
7: 1
4: 2
2: 3
9: 4
5: 5
8: 6
1: 7
6: 8
3: 9

Next, we will count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. 

After analyzing all the edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<4, 1, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
