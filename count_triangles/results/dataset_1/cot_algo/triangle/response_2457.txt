Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree of connection, the new labels for the nodes are: 
Node 5: 0 connections 
Node 0: 3 connections 
Node 3: 1 connection 
Node 4: 1 connection 
Node 7: 1 connection 
Node 9: 2 connections 
Node 1: 4 connections 
Node 8: 4 connections 
Node 2: 4 connections 
Node 6: 6 connections 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <0, 6, 9>
5. <1, 2, 8>
6. <1, 8, 9>
7. <2, 6, 8>
8. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
