Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 4 (Degree 2) 
Node 0 (Degree 3) 
Node 5 (Degree 3) 
Node 6 (Degree 3) 
Node 1 (Degree 4) 
Node 8 (Degree 4) 
Node 7 (Degree 4) 
Node 3 (Degree 5) 
Node 2 (Degree 6) 

Now, let's count the triangles formed within this graph:

- Triangle <0, 2, 1>
- Triangle <0, 2, 7>
- Triangle <0, 7, 5>
- Triangle <1, 2, 3>
- Triangle <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle <1, 2, 8>
- Triangle <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle <1, 3, 8>
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle <2, 3, 8>
- Triangle <2, 8, 7>
- Triangle <3, 6, 4>
- Triangle <3, 8, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
