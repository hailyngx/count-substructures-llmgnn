Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertices: 3, 1, 8, 0, 5, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9

Then we can proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Calculating the triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with vertex 0 and vertex 2 are 5, so the triangle is <0, 2, 5>.
- Edge (1, 6): Shared connections with vertex 1 and vertex 6 are 9, so the triangle is <1, 6, 9>.
- Edge (2, 0): This edge is skipped since vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 0.
- Edge (2, 3): Shared connections with vertex 2 and vertex 3 are 0, so the triangle is <0, 2, 3>.
- Edge (4, 6): This edge is skipped since vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 4.
- Edge (4, 9): Shared connections with vertex 4 and vertex 9 are 6, so the triangle is <4, 6, 9>.
- Edge (5, 0): Shared connections with vertex 5 and vertex 0 are 7, so the triangle is <0, 5, 7>.
- Edge (5, 7): Shared connections with vertex 5 and vertex 7 are 0, so the triangle is <0, 5, 7>.
- Edge (7, 5): this edge is skipped since vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 5.
- Edge (7, 8): Shared connections with vertex 7 and vertex 8 are 9, so the triangle is <7, 8, 9>.
- Edge (9, 4): Shared connections with vertex 9 and vertex 4 are 6, so the triangle is <4, 6, 9>.

Count of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 5>, <1, 6, 9>, <0, 2, 3>, <4, 6, 9>, <0, 5, 7>
