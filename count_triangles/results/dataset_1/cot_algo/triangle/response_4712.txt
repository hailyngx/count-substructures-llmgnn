Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:  

Node 8 has 1 connection.  
Node 6 has 2 connections.  
Node 2 has 2 connections.  
Node 5 has 4 connections.  
Node 9 has 4 connections.  
Node 1 has 4 connections.  
Node 4 has 5 connections.  
Node 7 has 6 connections.  
Node 0 has 6 connections.  
Node 3 has 7 connections.  

Sorted nodes from least to most connected: 8, 6, 2, 5, 9, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3

Considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, process the following edges:

<1, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 0, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 0, 7>, <5, 9, 6>, <5, 9, 7>, <6, 9, 7>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
