Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of connections for each vertex:
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Sorting the vertices by the number of connections in increasing order:
Nodes: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 9

Now, we will check each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Edge between 1 and 2: Node 1 has 2 connections, Node 2 has 3 connections. No triangle.
- Edge between 1 and 3: Node 1 has 2 connections, Node 3 has 2 connections. Triangle formed with Node 2.
- Edge between 2 and 6: Node 2 has 3 connections, Node 6 has 2 connections. Triangle formed with Node 3.
- Edge between 3 and 6: Node 3 has 2 connections, Node 6 has 2 connections. No triangle.
- Edge between 4 and 5: Node 4 has 2 connections, Node 5 has 2 connections. No triangle.
- Edge between 4 and 9: Node 4 has 2 connections, Node 9 has 4 connections. No triangle.
- Edge between 5 and 9: Node 5 has 2 connections, Node 9 has 4 connections. No triangle.
- Edge between 6 and 7: Node 6 has 2 connections, Node 7 has 2 connections. No triangle.
- Edge between 7 and 9: Node 7 has 2 connections, Node 9 has 4 connections. No triangle.

Count of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 3>, <2, 6, 7>
