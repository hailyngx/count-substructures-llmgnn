Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their degree and relabeling them accordingly.

The sorted vertices are: 7, 3, 8, 0, 5, 9, 6, 1, 4, 2.

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

For the edge (0, 2), we have the following triangles: <0, 2, 1> and <0, 2, 6>.
For the edge (0, 7), we have no triangles.
For the edge (1, 2), we have the following triangles: <1, 2, 4>.
For the edge (1, 4), we have no triangles.
For the edge (1, 6), we have no triangles.
For the edge (1, 9), we have no triangles.
For the edge (2, 0), we have the following triangle: <2, 0, 7>.
For the edge (2, 1), we have the following triangle: <2, 1, 4>.
For the edge (2, 4), we have the following triangles: <2, 4, 1> and <2, 4, 5>.
For the edge (2, 5), we have the following triangle: <2, 5, 4>.
For the edge (2, 6), we have the following triangle: <2, 6, 1>.
For the edge (3, 6), we have no triangles.
For the edge (4, 1), we have the following triangle: <4, 1, 2>.
For the edge (4, 2), we have the following triangles: <4, 2, 1> and <4, 2, 5>.
For the edge (4, 5), we have no triangles.
For the edge (4, 8), we have no triangles.
For the edge (5, 2), we have the following triangle: <5, 2, 4>.
For the edge (5, 4), we have no triangles.
For the edge (6, 1), we have no triangles.
For the edge (6, 2), we have the following triangle: <6, 2, 1>.
For the edge (6, 3), we have no triangles.
For the edge (6, 9), we have no triangles.
For the edge (7, 0), we have no triangles.
For the edge (8, 4), we have no triangles.
For the edge (9, 1), we have no triangles.
For the edge (9, 6), we have no triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
