Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
0 (degree 4)
1 (degree 2)
2 (degree 4)
3 (degree 3)
4 (degree 4)
5 (degree 3)
6 (degree 2)
7 (degree 2)
8 (degree 3)
9 (degree 2)

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will consider edges in the following order: 
(1, 0), (6, 2), (9, 6), (7, 4), (8, 3), (7, 8), (5, 2), (8, 5), (5, 4), (6, 2), (5, 8), (5, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)

By following the method and counting the triangles formed by shared connections, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<3, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles is [4].
