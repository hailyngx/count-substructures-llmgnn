Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each node has:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections

Now, we'll relabel the vertices based on their number of connections, starting from the vertex with the least connections:
Node 0 -> Node 1
Node 1 -> Node 2
Node 2 -> Node 3
Node 3 -> Node 4
Node 4 -> Node 5
Node 5 -> Node 6
Node 6 -> Node 7
Node 7 -> Node 8
Node 8 -> Node 9

Now, we'll go through each edge and count the triangles:
(0, 4): no triangle
(0, 5): no triangle
(1, 3): no triangle
(1, 5): <1, 2, 5>
(2, 5): <2, 3, 5>
(2, 6): no triangle
(2, 7): <2, 3, 7>
(3, 1): no triangle
(3, 6): no triangle
(3, 7): <3, 4, 7>
(4, 0): no triangle
(4, 8): no triangle
(5, 0): no triangle
(5, 1): <5, 2, 1>
(5, 2): <5, 2, 3>
(6, 2): no triangle
(6, 3): no triangle
(7, 2): no triangle
(7, 3): <7, 3, 4>
(7, 8): no triangle
(8, 4): no triangle
(8, 7): no triangle

Count of triangles: 5

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<5, 2, 1>
