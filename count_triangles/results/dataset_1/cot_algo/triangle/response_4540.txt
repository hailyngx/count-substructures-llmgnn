Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 7, 2, 5, 6, 4, 1, 9, 0, 8, 3.

Considering each edge following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Edge (0, 3): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.
Edge (0, 4): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.
Edge (0, 6): Vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 0, so potential triangle: <0, 6, 9>.
Edge (0, 9): Vertex 9 has fewer connections than vertex 0, so potential triangle: <0, 6, 9>.
Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 3, so potential triangle: <1, 3, 8>.
Edge (1, 7): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.
Edge (1, 8): Vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 1, so no triangle.
Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 4, so potential triangle: <2, 4, 8>.
Edge (2, 8): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.
Edge (3, 0): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.
Edge (3, 1): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 3, so potential triangle: <1, 3, 8>.
Edge (3, 5): Vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 3, so no triangle.
Edge (3, 8): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.
Edge (3, 9): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.
Edge (4, 0): Vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 4, so no triangle.
Edge (4, 2): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 4, so potential triangle: <2, 4, 8>.
Edge (4, 8): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.
Edge (5, 3): Vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 3, so no triangle.
Edge (5, 8): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.
Edge (6, 0): Vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 6, so no triangle.
Edge (6, 9): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.
Edge (7, 1): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.
Edge (8, 1): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 8, so potential triangle: <1, 3, 8>.
Edge (8, 2): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 8, so potential triangle: <2, 4, 8>.
Edge (8, 3): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.
Edge (8, 4): Vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 8, so no triangle.
Edge (8, 5): Vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 8, so no triangle.
Edge (9, 0): Vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 9, so no triangle.
Edge (9, 3): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.
Edge (9, 6): Both vertices have more connections than their edge, so no triangle.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 8>.
