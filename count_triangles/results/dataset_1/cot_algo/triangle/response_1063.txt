Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0 -> degree 1
Node 4 -> degree 1
Node 8 -> degree 2
Node 1 -> degree 3
Node 5 -> degree 3
Node 3 -> degree 3
Node 6 -> degree 3
Node 9 -> degree 4
Node 7 -> degree 5
Node 2 -> degree 5

Now, we analyze the edges starting from the nodes with the lowest degrees to find triangles:

1. (0, 1): No triangle
2. (1, 2): No triangle
3. (1, 8): No triangle
4. (2, 5): No triangle
5. (3, 6): No triangle
6. (3, 7): No triangle
7. (4, 7): No triangle
8. (5, 7): No triangle
9. (6, 9): Triangle <6, 7, 9>
10. (7, 4): No triangle
11. (7, 5): Triangle <5, 6, 7>
12. (7, 9): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <6, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 7>
