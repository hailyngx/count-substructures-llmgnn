Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices is: 

Vertex 1 has 2 connections.
Vertex 4 has 0 connections.
Vertex 5 has 0 connections.
Vertex 0 has 2 connections.
Vertex 7 has 2 connections.
Vertex 9 has 2 connections.
Vertex 3 has 5 connections.
Vertex 6 has 4 connections.
Vertex 8 has 4 connections.
Vertex 2 has 7 connections.
