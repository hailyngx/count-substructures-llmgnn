Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 0: 7 connections

Relabeling:
Node 3 -> Node 0
Node 1 -> Node 1
Node 9 -> Node 2
Node 5 -> Node 3
Node 8 -> Node 4
Node 7 -> Node 5
Node 2 -> Node 6
Node 6 -> Node 7
Node 4 -> Node 8
Node 0 -> Node 9
