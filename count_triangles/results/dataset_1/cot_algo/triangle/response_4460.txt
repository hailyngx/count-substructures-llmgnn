Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following order:

Node 6: Degree 0
Nodes 1, 3, 5: Degree 1
Nodes 2, 4: Degree 2
Nodes 0, 7: Degree 4

Now, we will examine each edge based on the sorting order:

1. Edge (0, 5): Both nodes 0 and 5 have degree 4, so this edge does not form a triangle.
2. Edge (0, 7): Both nodes 0 and 7 have degree 4, so this edge does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 3): Nodes 1 and 3 have degree 1, so this edge does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (2, 4): Both nodes 2 and 4 have degree 2, so this edge does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 has degree 2, which is less than the degree of node 7 (4). We check for shared connections and find node 4. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <2, 4, 7>.
6. Edge (3, 1): Nodes 1 and 3 have degree 1, so this edge does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (4, 2): Node 4 has degree 2, which is less than the degree of node 2 (2). Since there are no shared connections, no triangle is formed.
8. Edge (4, 7): Node 4 has degree 2, which is less than the degree of node 7 (4). We check for shared connections and find node 2. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <2, 4, 7>.
9. Edge (5, 0): Both nodes 0 and 5 have degree 4, so this edge does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (7, 0): Both nodes 0 and 7 have degree 4, so this edge does not form a triangle.
11. Edge (7, 2): Node 7 has degree 4, which is more than the degree of node 2 (2). So, this edge does not form a triangle.
12. Edge (7, 4): Node 7 has degree 4, which is more than the degree of node 4 (2). So, this edge does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 7>.
