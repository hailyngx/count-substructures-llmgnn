Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
- Node 7 (Degree 2)
- Node 1 (Degree 3)
- Node 9 (Degree 3)
- Node 5 (Degree 4)
- Node 4 (Degree 4)
- Node 6 (Degree 4)
- Node 8 (Degree 4)
- Node 0 (Degree 6)
- Node 3 (Degree 6)
- Node 2 (Degree 7)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <0, 6, 5>
- <0, 3, 1>
- <0, 3, 2>
- <0, 1, 2>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <5, 2, 7>
- <5, 8, 2>
- <5, 9, 2>
- <7, 8, 2>
- <7, 8, 4>
- <7, 4, 2>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <3, 6, 0>
- <3, 6, 1>
- <3, 6, 5>
- <3, 7, 0>
- <3, 7, 4>
- <3, 8, 0>
- <3, 8, 2>
- <3, 9, 2>
- <1, 6, 0>
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [36].
