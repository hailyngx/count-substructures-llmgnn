Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of vertices with their corresponding connections:

Node 6 - Degree 0
Nodes 1, 3, 9 - Degree 1
Nodes 5, 4, 8 - Degree 3
Nodes 7, 2 - Degree 5
Node 0 - Degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections.

Triangles:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [11]
