Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the degree of each node:

Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 1
Node 7: degree 1
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3

Now, we sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order and relabel them:
Node 6: degree 1 -> Node 1
Node 7: degree 1 -> Node 2
Node 3: degree 2 -> Node 3
Node 9: degree 3 -> Node 4
Node 8: degree 3 -> Node 5
Node 4: degree 4 -> Node 6
Node 2: degree 4 -> Node 7

Next, we check each edge and count the number of triangles:

1. (1, 4): Node 1 and Node 6 share a connection with Node 2 forming triangle <1, 4, 2>.
2. (1, 7): No triangles.
3. (2, 3): No triangles.
4. (2, 4): Node 7 and Node 6 share a connection with Node 1 forming triangle <2, 4, 1>.
5. (2, 8): No triangles.
6. (3, 2): No triangles.
7. (3, 9): No triangles.
8. (4, 1): Node 6 and Node 1 share a connection with Node 2 forming triangle <4, 1, 2>.
9. (4, 2): Node 6 and Node 7 share a connection with Node 1 forming triangle <4, 2, 1>.
10. (4, 6): No triangles.
11. (6, 4): No triangles.
12. (7, 1): No triangles.
13. (8, 2): No triangles.
14. (8, 9): No triangles.
15. (9, 3): No triangles.
16. (9, 8): No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <1, 4, 2>, <2, 4, 1>, and <4, 1, 2>.
