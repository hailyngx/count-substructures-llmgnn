Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following order: 3, 4, 9, 2, 6, 8, 5, 7, 1, 0.

Examining the edges with the lower labeled vertices having fewer connections, we find the triangles formed by shared connections:

- Edge (3, 4): Shared connection with 7 forms a triangle <3, 4, 7>.
- Edge (3, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 7): Shared connection with 2 forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 0): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 5): Shared connections with 7 and 6 form triangles <1, 5, 7> and <1, 5, 6>.
- Edge (2, 1): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 1): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 7): Shared connection with 1 forms a triangle <1, 5, 7>.
- Edge (7, 2): No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 4): Shared connection with 2 forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
- Edge (7, 5): Shared connection with 1 forms a triangle <1, 5, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5], and the unique triangles found are <3, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, and <1, 5, 6>.
