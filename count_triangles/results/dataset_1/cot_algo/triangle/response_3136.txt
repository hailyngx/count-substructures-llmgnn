Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following labeling:  
Node 5: degree 1  
Node 7: degree 1  
Node 4: degree 2  
Node 6: degree 0  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 0: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 5  
Node 2: degree 5  
Node 9: degree 7

Following the degree-based ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the triangles and count them. 

The triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 8, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles is [8].
