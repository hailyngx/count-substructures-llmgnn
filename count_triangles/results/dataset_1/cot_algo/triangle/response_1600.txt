Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:
- Vertex 7: Degree 1
- Vertex 6: Degree 1
- Vertex 5: Degree 1
- Vertex 8: Degree 1
- Vertex 0: Degree 3
- Vertex 1: Degree 2
- Vertex 4: Degree 2
- Vertex 3: Degree 2
- Vertex 9: Degree 4
- Vertex 2: Degree 4

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Counting triangles:
- For edge (0, 2): Vertex 0 has 3 connections, Vertex 2 has 4 connections. We proceed.
    - Shared connections between 0 and 2 are 1 and 5. So, the triangle is <0, 2, 5>.
- For edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 has 3 connections, Vertex 5 has 1 connection. We proceed.
    - Shared connection between 0 and 5 is 2. So, the triangle is <0, 2, 5>.
- For edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has 3 connections, Vertex 8 has 1 connection. We proceed.
    - No shared connections, no triangles.
- For edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, Vertex 2 has 4 connections. We proceed.
    - Shared connection between 1 and 2 is 3. So, the triangle is <1, 2, 3>.
- For edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, Vertex 3 has 2 connections. We proceed.
    - No shared connections, no triangles.
- For edge (2, 0): Vertex 2 has 4 connections, Vertex 0 has 3 connections. We proceed.
    - Shared connections between 2 and 0 are 1 and 5. So, the triangle is <0, 2, 5>.
- For edge (2, 1): Vertex 2 has 4 connections, Vertex 1 has 2 connections. We proceed.
    - Shared connection between 2 and 1 is 3. So, the triangle is <1, 2, 3>.
- For edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 has 4 connections, Vertex 3 has 2 connections. We proceed.
    - Shared connection between 2 and 3 is 1. So, the triangle is <2, 1, 3>.
- For edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has 4 connections, Vertex 9 has 4 connections. We proceed.
    - Shared connections between 2 and 9 are 4 and 7. So, the triangle is <2, 4, 9>.
- For edge (3, 1): Vertex 3 has 2 connections, Vertex 1 has 2 connections. We proceed.
    - No shared connections, no triangles.
- For edge (3, 2): Vertex 3 has 2 connections, Vertex 2 has 4 connections. We proceed.
    - Shared connection between 3 and 2 is 1. So, the triangle is <2, 1, 3>.
- For edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 has 2 connections, Vertex 6 has 1 connection. We proceed.
    - No shared connections, no triangles.
- For edge (4, 9): Vertex 4 has 2 connections, Vertex 9 has 4 connections. We proceed.
    - Shared connection between 4 and 9 is 7. So, the triangle is <4, 7, 9>.
- For edge (5, 0): Vertex 5 has 1 connection, Vertex 0 has 3 connections. We proceed.
    - Shared connection between 5 and 0 is 2. So, the triangle is <0, 2, 5>.
- For edge (6, 4): Vertex 6 has 1 connection, Vertex 4 has 2 connections. We proceed.
    - No shared connections, no triangles.
- For edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has 1 connection, Vertex 9 has 4 connections. We proceed.
    - Shared connection between 7 and 9 is 4. So, the triangle is <4, 7, 9>.
- For edge (8, 0): Vertex 8 has 1 connection, Vertex 0 has 3 connections. We proceed.
    - No shared connections, no triangles.
- For edge (9, 2): Vertex 9 has 4 connections, Vertex 2 has 4 connections. We proceed.
    - Shared connections between 9 and 2 are 4 and 7. So, the triangle is <2, 4, 9>.
- For edge (9, 4): Vertex 9 has 4 connections, Vertex 4 has 2 connections. We proceed.
    - Shared connection between 9 and 4 is 7. So, the triangle is <4, 7, 9>.
- For edge (9, 7): Vertex 9 has 4 connections, Vertex 7 has 1 connection. We proceed.
    - Shared connection between 9 and 7 is 4. So, the triangle is <4, 7, 9>.
