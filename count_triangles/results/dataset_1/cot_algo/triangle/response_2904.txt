Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we have the following labels for the nodes: 

Node 0 : 4 connections
Node 1 : 4 connections
Node 2 : 2 connections
Node 3 : 4 connections
Node 4 : 2 connections
Node 5 : 2 connections
Node 6 : 5 connections
Node 8 : 4 connections
Node 9 : 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (2, 6): Forms a triangle with connection 6: <2, 6, 1>
- Edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle with connection 6: <4, 6, 1>
- Edge (5, 6): Forms a triangle with connection 6: <5, 6, 1>
- Edge (6, 9): Forms a triangle with connection 6: <6, 9, 1>
- Edge (3, 9): Forms a triangle with connection 3: <3, 9, 0>
- Edge (0, 9): Forms a triangle with connection 9: <0, 9, 1>
- Edge (1, 8): Forms a triangle with connection 1: <1, 8, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
