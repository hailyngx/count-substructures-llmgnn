Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has:

Node 3: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Calculating the number of triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 is less connected.
   - Shared connections: 8
   <0, 2, 8>

2. Edge (0, 8): Node 0 is less connected.
   - Shared connections: 1
   <0, 1, 8>

3. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 is less connected.
   - Shared connections: 7
   <1, 5, 7>

4. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 is less connected.
   - Shared connections: 5
   <1, 5, 6>

5. Edge (1, 7): Node 1 is less connected.
   - Shared connections: 4
   <1, 4, 7>

6. Edge (1, 8): Node 0 is less connected.
   - Shared connections: 8
   <0, 1, 8>

7. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 is less connected.
   - Shared connections: 8
   <2, 4, 8>

8. Edge (3, 9): Node 3 is less connected.
   - No triangle formed.

9. Edge (4, 5): Node 4 is less connected.
   - Shared connections: 7
   <4, 5, 7>

10. Edge (4, 7): Node 4 is less connected.
   - Shared connections: 5
   <4, 5, 7>

11. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 is less connected.
   - Shared connections: 1
   <1, 5, 6>

12. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 is less connected.
   - No triangle formed.

The total number of triangles is [8].

Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 7>.
