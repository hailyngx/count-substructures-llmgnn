Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 0 -> Degree 2  
Node 1 -> Degree 2  
Node 3 -> Degree 3  
Node 7 -> Degree 2  
Node 5 -> Degree 3  
Node 6 -> Degree 3  
Node 8 -> Degree 4  
Node 4 -> Degree 5  
Node 9 -> Degree 5  
Node 2 -> Degree 6  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:  
[21 triangles]
