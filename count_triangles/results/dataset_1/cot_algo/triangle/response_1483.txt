Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 6, 9, 0, 4, 5, 7, 3, 8, 2, 1.

After relabeling the vertices, the edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1).

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangle 1: <1, 2, 3>
Triangle 2: <1, 3, 7>
Triangle 3: <1, 3, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
