Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Vertices by their connections: 
0: 2 connections 
1: 1 connection 
2: 3 connections 
3: 1 connection 
4: 4 connections 
5: 4 connections 
6: 1 connection 
7: 1 connection 
8: 3 connections 
9: 3 connections 

Edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections: 
(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 8), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 6), (8, 5), (9, 3), (9, 5)

Triangles: 
<0, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [5]
