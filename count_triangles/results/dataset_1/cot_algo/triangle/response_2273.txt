Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on their number of connections:
Nodes with degree 2: 1, 6, 8
Nodes with degree 3: 2
Nodes with degree 4: 5
Nodes with degree 5: 3, 4
Nodes with degree 6: 7, 9
Node with degree 7: 0

We will now proceed with counting the triangles:
- For edge (1, 4):
    - Both nodes have degree 2. No triangle is formed.
- For edge (1, 9):
    - Node 1 has degree 2, and Node 9 has degree 6.
    - Looking at shared neighbors of Node 1 and Node 9: Node 4 is common.
    - Triangle <1, 4, 9> is formed.
- For edge (0, 5):
    - Node 0 has degree 7, and Node 5 has degree 4.
    - Looking at shared neighbors of Node 0 and Node 5: No shared neighbors.
- Continue this process for all edges to count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is [1]. 
The unique triangle found is <1, 4, 9>.
