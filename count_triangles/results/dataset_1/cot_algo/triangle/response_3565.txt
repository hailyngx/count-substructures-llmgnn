Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in increasing order:

Vertices: 2, 7, 9, 0, 4, 6, 8, 5, 1, 3

Now, we can re-label the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 2 (degree 2) becomes vertex 0
Vertex 7 (degree 3) becomes vertex 1
Vertex 9 (degree 3) becomes vertex 2
Vertex 0 (degree 4) becomes vertex 3
Vertex 4 (degree 4) becomes vertex 4
Vertex 6 (degree 4) becomes vertex 5
Vertex 8 (degree 4) becomes vertex 6
Vertex 5 (degree 6) becomes vertex 7
Vertex 1 (degree 7) becomes vertex 8
Vertex 3 (degree 8) becomes vertex 9

Now, we examine each edge in the graph where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(0, 1) forms triangles with 0 -> 3 and 1 -> 8: <0, 1, 8>
(0, 2) does not form a triangle
(0, 4) forms a triangle with 0 -> 3 and 4 -> 4: <0, 3, 4>
(0, 5) forms a triangle with 0 -> 3 and 5 -> 7: <0, 3, 5>
(1, 3) forms a triangle with 1 -> 8 and 3 -> 9: <1, 3, 9>
(1, 4) forms a triangle with 1 -> 8 and 4 -> 4: <1, 4, 8>
(1, 5) forms triangles with 1 -> 8 and 5 -> 7: <1, 5, 7> and <1, 5, 8>
(1, 6) forms a triangle with 1 -> 8 and 6 -> 5: <1, 5, 8>
(1, 9) forms a triangle with 1 -> 8 and 9 -> 2: <1, 2, 8>
(2, 3) does not form a triangle
(3, 4) does not form a triangle
(3, 5) forms a triangle with 3 -> 9 and 5 -> 7: <3, 5, 7> and <3, 5, 9>
(3, 6) forms triangles with 3 -> 9 and 6 -> 5: <3, 5, 9> and <3, 6, 5>
(3, 7) does not form a triangle
(3, 8) does not form a triangle
(4, 6) forms a triangle with 4 -> 4 and 6 -> 5: <4, 5, 5>
(5, 6) forms a triangle with 5 -> 7 and 6 -> 5: <5, 5, 7>
(5, 8) forms a triangle with 5 -> 7 and 8 -> 6: <5, 6, 7>
(5, 9) forms a triangle with 5 -> 7 and 9 -> 2: <5, 7, 2>
(6, 8) forms a triangle with 6 -> 5 and 8 -> 6: <6, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 5>, <4, 5, 5>, <5, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 2>, <6, 5, 6>.
