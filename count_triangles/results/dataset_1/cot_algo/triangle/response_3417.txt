Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

Node degrees:
Node 0 - degree 2
Node 1 - degree 1
Node 2 - degree 4
Node 4 - degree 2
Node 5 - degree 2
Node 6 - degree 2
Node 7 - degree 3
Node 8 - degree 1
Node 9 - degree 5

Sorting by degree (lowest to highest) and relabeling nodes:
Node 1 (degree 1)
Node 8 (degree 1)
Node 0 (degree 2)
Node 4 (degree 2)
Node 5 (degree 2)
Node 6 (degree 2)
Node 7 (degree 3)
Node 2 (degree 4)
Node 9 (degree 5)

Now, we will go through the edges in the order given:

(1, 2): Does not form a triangle.
(1, 8): Does not form a triangle.
(0, 6): Does not form a triangle.
(0, 9): Does not form a triangle.
(4, 5): Does not form a triangle.
(4, 9): Does not form a triangle.
(5, 7): Does not form a triangle.
(6, 9): Does not form a triangle.
(7, 8): Does not form a triangle.
(7, 5): Does not form a triangle.
(7, 2): Does not form a triangle.
(9, 2): Does not form a triangle.
(9, 6): <0, 6, 9>
(2, 7): Does not form a triangle.
(2, 9): <0, 2, 9>
(2, 1): Does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 2, 9>
