Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  
Vertex 4 has degree 1  
Vertices 6 and 9 have degree 2  
Vertices 0, 2, and 5 have degree 3  
Vertices 1 and 6 have degree 4  
Vertices 7 and 8 have degree 5  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(0, 3): Forms triangle <0, 3, 1>  
(0, 8): Forms triangle <0, 8, 2>  
(0, 9): Forms triangle <0, 9, 5>  
(1, 3): Forms triangle <1, 3, 0>  
(1, 4): Does not form a triangle  
(1, 7): Forms triangle <1, 7, 2>  
(1, 8): Forms triangle <1, 8, 0>  
(1, 9): Forms triangle <1, 9, 5>  
(2, 6): Does not form a triangle  
(2, 7): Forms triangle <2, 7, 1>  
(2, 8): Forms triangle <2, 8, 0>  
(3, 5): Forms triangle <3, 5, 7>  
(3, 6): Does not form a triangle  
(5, 7): Forms triangle <5, 7, 1>  
(5, 9): Forms triangle <5, 9, 1>  
(7, 8): Forms triangle <7, 8, 0>  
(8, 9): Forms triangle <8, 9, 0>  

Total number of triangles: [9]
