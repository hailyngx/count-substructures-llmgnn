Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:
0 --> 1 connection
2 --> 0 connections
9 --> 0 connections
5 --> 1 connection
3 --> 2 connections
6 --> 1 connection
4 --> 2 connections
7 --> 3 connections
1 --> 6 connections
8 --> 7 connections

Now we can proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 has 1 connection, Vertex 1 has 6 connections.
   Check for shared connections between Vertex 0 and Vertex 1: None.

2. Edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 has 6 connections, Vertex 4 has 2 connections.
   Check for shared connections between Vertex 1 and Vertex 4: None.

3. Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has 6 connections, Vertex 7 has 3 connections.
   Check for shared connections between Vertex 1 and Vertex 7: None.

4. Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has 6 connections, Vertex 8 has 7 connections.
   Check for shared connections between Vertex 1 and Vertex 8: None.

5. Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 has 2 connections, Vertex 5 has 1 connection.
   Check for shared connections between Vertex 3 and Vertex 5: None.

6. Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 has 2 connections, Vertex 8 has 7 connections.
   Check for shared connections between Vertex 3 and Vertex 8: None.

7. Edge (4, 1): Skip this edge, as Vertex 4 has more connections than Vertex 1.

8. Edge (5, 3): Skip this edge, as Vertex 5 has more connections than Vertex 3.

9. Edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 has 1 connection, Vertex 8 has 7 connections.
   Check for shared connections between Vertex 6 and Vertex 8: None.

10. Edge (7, 1): Skip this edge, as Vertex 7 has more connections than Vertex 1.

11. Edge (7, 8): Skip this edge, as Vertex 7 has more connections than Vertex 8.

12. Edge (8, 1): Skip this edge, as Vertex 8 has more connections than Vertex 1.

13. Edge (8, 3): Skip this edge, as Vertex 8 has more connections than Vertex 3.

14. Edge (8, 6): Skip this edge, as Vertex 8 has more connections than Vertex 6.

15. Edge (8, 7): Skip this edge, as Vertex 8 has more connections than Vertex 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [0].
