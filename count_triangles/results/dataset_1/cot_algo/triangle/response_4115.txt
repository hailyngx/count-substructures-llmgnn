Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 0 has 1 connection
Node 7 has 1 connection
Node 8 has 3 connections
Node 3 has 4 connections
Node 5 has 4 connections
Node 6 has 4 connections
Node 1 has 5 connections
Node 2 has 5 connections
Node 9 has 5 connections
Node 4 has 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
