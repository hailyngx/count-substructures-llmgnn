Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following labels: 

0 (degree 3), 1 (degree 3), 6 (degree 2), 7 (degree 2), 4 (degree 1), 9 (degree 3), 5 (degree 4), 8 (degree 4), 3 (degree 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we focus on the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (0, 4) --> Shared connections: 5
2. (0, 5) --> Shared connections: 1, 4
3. (0, 8) --> No triangle formed
4. (1, 3) --> No triangle formed
5. (1, 5) --> Shared connections: 0
6. (1, 8) --> No triangle formed
7. (3, 7) --> No triangle formed
8. (4, 0) --> Shared connections: 5
9. (5, 6) --> No triangle formed
10. (5, 9) --> Shared connections: 1
11. (6, 7) --> No triangle formed
12. (7, 6) --> No triangle formed
13. (8, 9) --> Shared connections: 1
14. (9, 3) --> Shared connections: 5
15. (9, 5) --> Shared connections: 1

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>.
