Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:

Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 1
Vertex 2: degree 1
Vertex 3: degree 1
Vertex 4: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 1

Now, we will rearrange the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:

Vertices sorted: 1, 2, 3, 8, 5, 4, 0, 6, 7

Next, we will re-label the graph based on the new vertex ordering:

New edges with relabeled vertices: (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6)

Now we can count the triangles by checking the shared connections between vertices connected by an edge:

Triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>

Finally, we count the total number of triangles, which is 3:
Total number of triangles: [3]
