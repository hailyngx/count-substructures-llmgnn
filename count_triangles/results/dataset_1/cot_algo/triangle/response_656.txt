Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Upon sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new vertex labels are as follows: 

Node 0 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 6

The connections between the nodes can be represented as follows (sorted by the new vertex labels):
0: [2, 5]
1: [2, 4, 6, 7]
2: [0, 1, 6, 7, 9]
3: [4, 9]
4: [1, 3, 7, 8, 9]
5: [0, 9]
6: [1, 2]
7: [1, 2, 4, 8]
8: [4, 7]
9: [2, 3, 4, 5]

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[11]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
