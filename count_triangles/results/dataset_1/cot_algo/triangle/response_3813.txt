Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order, we get: 
Nodes with connections [0, 3] -> Node 2
Nodes with connections [1, 2, 4] -> Node 7
Nodes with connections [2, 3, 4, 5, 8] -> Node 6
Nodes with connections [2, 3, 6] -> Node 5
Nodes with connections [3, 4, 6] -> Node 8
Nodes with connections [4, 4, 5, 5, 5] -> Node 1
Nodes with connections [5, 7, 8, 9] -> Node 9
Nodes with connections [6, 6, 7] -> Node 0
Nodes with connections [7, 7] -> Node 3
Nodes with connections [8, 9] -> Node 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we check the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
