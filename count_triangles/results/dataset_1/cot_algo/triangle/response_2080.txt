Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree, from least to most connected. Then each vertex is relabeled accordingly. 

The sorted vertices are: <4, 0, 1, 8, 6, 5, 7, 3, 9, 2>.

Now, we will check each edge to count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 5): Both 0 and 5 are connected to 3, forming the triangle <0, 3, 5>.
2. Edge (1, 7): No triangles are formed.
3. Edge (1, 9): No triangles are formed.
4. Edge (2, 3): No triangles are formed.
5. Edge (2, 6): No triangles are formed.
6. Edge (2, 7): No triangles are formed.
7. Edge (3, 2): No triangles are formed.
8. Edge (3, 5): Both 2 and 5 are connected to 7, forming the triangle <2, 5, 7>.
9. Edge (3, 9): Both 2 and 9 are connected to 7, forming the triangle <2, 7, 9>.
10. Edge (4, 6): No triangles are formed.
11. Edge (5, 0): Both 3 and 0 are connected to 2, forming the triangle <0, 2, 3>.
12. Edge (5, 3): No triangles are formed.
13. Edge (5, 7): Both 0 and 7 are connected to 2, forming the triangle <0, 2, 7>.
14. Edge (5, 9): Both 0 and 9 are connected to 2, forming the triangle <0, 2, 9>.
15. Edge (6, 2): No triangles are formed.
16. Edge (6, 4): No triangles are formed.
17. Edge (6, 9): Both 2 and 9 are connected to 7, forming the triangle <2, 7, 9>.
18. Edge (7, 1): No triangles are formed.
19. Edge (7, 2): No triangles are formed.
20. Edge (7, 5): Both 1 and 5 are connected to 9, forming the triangle <1, 5, 9>.
21. Edge (9, 1): No triangles are formed.
22. Edge (9, 3): No triangles are formed.
23. Edge (9, 5): Both 1 and 5 are connected to 7, forming the triangle <1, 5, 7>.
24. Edge (9, 6): No triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>.
