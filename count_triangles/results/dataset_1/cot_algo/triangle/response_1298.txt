Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections.

Sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
0: 3
1: 1
2: 2
3: 2
4: 5
5: 1
6: 3
7: 3
8: 2
9: 6

Counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: [<0, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [2]
