Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the relabeling is as follows:
Node 3 (Degree 2) -> A
Node 4 (Degree 2) -> B
Node 5 (Degree 2) -> C
Node 0 (Degree 3) -> D
Node 8 (Degree 3) -> E
Node 9 (Degree 3) -> F
Node 1 (Degree 4) -> G
Node 7 (Degree 4) -> H
Node 2 (Degree 5) -> I
Node 6 (Degree 5) -> J

Now, counting the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering:
- For edge (0, 8): Check shared connections D and E have with F. No triangle.
- For edge (0, 9): Check shared connections D and F have with E. One triangle: <0, 8, 9>.
- For edge (1, 2): Check shared connections G and I have. No triangle.
- For edge (1, 6): Check shared connections G and J have. No triangle.
- For edge (1, 7): Check shared connections G and H have. No triangle.
- For edge (1, 8): Check shared connections G and E have with F. No triangle.
- For edge (2, 1): Check shared connections I and G have. No triangle.
- For edge (2, 5): Check shared connections I and C have. No triangle.
- For edge (2, 6): Check shared connections I and J have. Two triangles: <1, 2, 6> and <4, 6, 2>.
- For edge (3, 4): Check shared connections A and B have. No triangle.
- For edge (3, 7): Check shared connections A and H have. No triangle.
- For edge (4, 6): Check shared connections B and J have. One triangle: <1, 6, 4>.
- For edge (5, 2): Check shared connections C and I have. No triangle.

- For edge (7, 1): Check shared connections H and G have. No triangle.
- For edge (7, 3): Check shared connections H and A have. No triangle.
- For edge (7, 9): Check shared connections H and F have with E. No triangle.
- For edge (8, 0): Check shared connections E and D have with F. No triangle.
- For edge (8, 1): Check shared connections E and G have. No triangle.
- For edge (8, 9): Check shared connections E and F have with D. No triangle.
- For edge (9, 0): Check shared connections F and D have with E. No triangle.
- For edge (9, 5): Check shared connections F and C have. No triangle.
- For edge (9, 7): Check shared connections F and H have. No triangle.
