Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
0 - degree 1
1 - degree 6
2 - degree 2
3 - degree 2
4 - degree 2
5 - degree 4
6 - degree 5
7 - degree 4
8 - degree 1
9 - degree 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
0 -> 0 (degree 1)
2 -> 1 (degree 2)
3 -> 2 (degree 2)
4 -> 3 (degree 2)
8 -> 4 (degree 1)
5 -> 5 (degree 4)
9 -> 6 (degree 4)
1 -> 7 (degree 6)
6 -> 8 (degree 5)
7 -> 9 (degree 4)

Next, we will check the edges in order, starting from the one with the lower labeled vertex:

(0, 7) -> No triangles
(1, 3) -> No triangles
(1, 6) -> No triangles
(1, 7) -> No triangles
(1, 8) -> No triangles
(2, 3) -> No triangles
(3, 1) -> No triangles
(3, 2) -> No triangles
(4, 5) -> No triangles
(4, 9) -> Shared connection with 5: <4, 5, 9>
(5, 6) -> No triangles
(5, 9) -> Shared connection with 4: <4, 5, 9>
(6, 1) -> No triangles
(6, 5) -> No triangles
(6, 7) -> No triangles
(6, 9) -> Shared connection with 5: <5, 6, 9>
(7, 0) -> No triangles
(7, 1) -> No triangles
(7, 6) -> No triangles
(8, 1) -> No triangles
(9, 4) -> Shared connection with 5: <4, 5, 9>
(9, 5) -> Shared connection with 4: <4, 5, 9>
(9, 6) -> Shared connection with 5: <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
The unique triangles found are <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>.
