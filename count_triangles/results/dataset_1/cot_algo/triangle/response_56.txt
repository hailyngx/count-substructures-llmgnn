Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each vertex:
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 5
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 5
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 2

Now, we will relabel the nodes by their degree in ascending order:
- Node 0 (Degree 2) will be labeled as Node 0
- Node 1 (Degree 2) will be labeled as Node 1
- Node 7 (Degree 2) will be labeled as Node 2
- Node 9 (Degree 2) will be labeled as Node 3
- Node 6 (Degree 3) will be labeled as Node 4
- Node 8 (Degree 3) will be labeled as Node 5
- Node 3 (Degree 4) will be labeled as Node 6
- Node 5 (Degree 5) will be labeled as Node 7
- Node 2 (Degree 5) will be labeled as Node 8
- Node 4 (Degree 5) will be labeled as Node 9

After relabeling, the edges become:
(0, 8) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3)(3, 0) (3, 2)(3, 7) (3, 4)(4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5)(5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8)(6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5)(8, 2) (8, 5)

By using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles.

\[Total \ number \ of \ triangles: 6\]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
