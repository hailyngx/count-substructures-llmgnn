Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 2: 0 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections

Now, we examine each edge starting with the one involving the vertex with the lower label and fewer connections:

- Edge (1, 4): Shared connection with Node 3. Triangle <1, 3, 4>.
- Edge (1, 5): No shared connections.
- Edge (1, 6): Shared connection with Node 3. Triangle <1, 3, 6>.
- Edge (3, 4): Shared connection with Node 1. Triangle <3, 1, 4>.
- Edge (3, 5): Shared connection with Node 1. Triangle <3, 1, 5>.
- Edge (3, 6): No shared connections.
- Edge (4, 1): No need to process, already counted.
- Edge (4, 3): No need to process, already counted.
- Edge (4, 8): Shared connection with Node 9. Triangle <4, 8, 9>.
- Edge (5, 1): No need to process, already counted.
- Edge (5, 3): No need to process, already counted.
- Edge (5, 7): No shared connections.
- Edge (6, 1): No need to process, already counted.
- Edge (6, 3): No need to process, already counted.
- Edge (7, 5): No shared connections.
- Edge (8, 4): No need to process, already counted.
- Edge (8, 9): No need to process, already counted.
- Edge (9, 8): No need to process, already counted.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <4, 8, 9>, <3, 1, 5>
