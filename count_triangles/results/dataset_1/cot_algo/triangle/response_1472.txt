Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will proceed as follows:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections in ascending order: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 7, 6, 8, 4.

Now, we will check each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 2): Both 0 and 2 have 4 connections. No triangle.
2. Edge (0, 4): 0 has 4 connections, and 4 has 5 connections. No triangle.
3. Edge (0, 5): 0 has 4 connections, and 5 has 4 connections. Shared connection found (node 2). Triangle <0, 2, 5>.
4. Edge (0, 8): 0 has 4 connections, and 8 has 4 connections. No triangle.
5. Edge (1, 4): 1 has 3 connections, and 4 has 5 connections. No triangle.
6. Edge (1, 7): 1 has 3 connections, and 7 has 4 connections. No triangle.
7. Edge (1, 8): 1 has 3 connections, and 8 has 4 connections. No triangle.
8. Edge (2, 0): Skipped as 2 has more connections than 0.
9. Edge (2, 5): 2 has 4 connections, and 5 has 4 connections. Shared connection found (node 0). Triangle <0, 2, 5>.
10. Edge (3, 4): 3 has 3 connections, and 4 has 5 connections. No triangle.
11. Edge (3, 6): 3 has 3 connections, and 6 has 3 connections. Shared connection found (node 7). Triangle <3, 6, 7>.
12. Edge (3, 7): 3 has 3 connections, and 7 has 4 connections. No triangle.
13. Edge (4, 0): Skipped as 4 has more connections than 0.
14. Edge (4, 1): Skipped as 4 has more connections than 1.
15. Edge (4, 3): Skipped as 4 has more connections than 3.
16. Edge (4, 9): 4 has 5 connections, and 9 has 3 connections. No triangle.
17. Edge (5, 0): Skipped as 5 has more connections than 0.
18. Edge (5, 2): Skipped as 5 has more connections than 2.
19. Edge (5, 8): 5 has 4 connections, and 8 has 4 connections. No triangle.
20. Edge (6, 3): Skipped as 6 has more connections than 3.
21. Edge (6, 7): 6 has 3 connections, and 7 has 4 connections. No triangle.
22. Edge (6, 9): 6 has 3 connections, and 9 has 3 connections. Shared connection found (node 4). Triangle <4, 6, 9>.
23. Edge (7, 1): Skipped as 7 has more connections than 1.
24. Edge (7, 3): Skipped as 7 has more connections than 3.
25. Edge (7, 6): Skipped as 7 has more connections than 6.
26. Edge (8, 0): Skipped as 8 has more connections than 0.
27. Edge (8, 1): Skipped as 8 has more connections than 1.
28. Edge (8, 5): Skipped as 8 has more connections than 5.
29. Edge (9, 4): 9 has 3 connections, and 4 has 5 connections. No triangle.
30. Edge (9, 6): Skipped as 9 has more connections than 6.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <3, 6, 7>, and <4, 6, 9>.
