Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 1 connection

Next, we'll relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Node 0 (2 connections): A
- Node 1 (1 connection): B
- Node 2 (5 connections): C
- Node 3 (3 connections): D
- Node 4 (1 connection): E
- Node 5 (3 connections): F
- Node 6 (2 connections): G
- Node 7 (3 connections): H
- Node 8 (2 connections): I
- Node 9 (1 connection): J

Now, we proceed with counting the triangles by checking for shared connections:
- Triangle 1: <C, D, H> (formed by connections (2, 3), (3, 7), and (2, 7))
- Triangle 2: <C, D, F> (formed by connections (2, 3), (5, 3), and (2, 5))

Count of Triangles: [2]
