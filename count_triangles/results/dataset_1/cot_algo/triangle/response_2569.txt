Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
(3, 4) - degree 1
(1, 2, 8) - degree 2
(7) - degree 3
(6) - degree 4
(0) - degree 5
(9) - degree 6
(5) - degree 8

Triangles in the graph:
[42]
