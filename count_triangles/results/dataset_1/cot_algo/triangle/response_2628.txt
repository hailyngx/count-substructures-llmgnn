Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
- Node 4: degree 0
- Node 9: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes:
- Node 4 -> Node 0
- Node 9 -> Node 1
- Node 5 -> Node 2
- Node 8 -> Node 3
- Node 0 -> Node 4
- Node 2 -> Node 5
- Node 3 -> Node 6
- Node 1 -> Node 7
- Node 6 -> Node 8
- Node 7 -> Node 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze each edge to count the triangles:
- (0, 7): Both nodes 0 and 7 have a degree higher than the other's, hence we skip this edge.
- (1, 7): Node 1 has a lower degree, so we check the shared connections: 7-0-1. Triangle found: <0, 1, 7>.
- (1, 8): Both nodes 1 and 8 have a degree higher than the other's, hence we skip this edge.
- (1, 9): Node 1 has a lower degree, so we check the shared connections: 1-7-9. Triangle found: <1, 7, 9>.
- (2, 6): Both nodes 2 and 6 have a degree higher than the other's, hence we skip this edge.
- (3, 6): Both nodes 3 and 6 have a degree higher than the other's, hence we skip this edge.
- (5, 7): Node 5 has a lower degree, so we check the shared connections: 5-7-0. Triangle found: <0, 5, 7>.
- (6, 2): Node 2 has a lower degree, so we check the shared connections: 6-3-2. Triangle found: <2, 3, 6>.
- (6, 3): Node 3 has a lower degree, so we check the shared connections: 6-3-2. Triangle found: <2, 3, 6>.
- (7, 0): Both nodes 7 and 0 have a degree higher than the other's, hence we skip this edge.
- (7, 1): Node 1 has a lower degree, so we check the shared connections: 1-7-9. This triangle was already counted.
- (7, 5): Node 5 has a lower degree, so we check the shared connections: 5-7-0. This triangle was already counted.
- (8, 1): Both nodes 8 and 1 have a degree higher than the other's, hence we skip this edge.
- (9, 1): Both nodes 9 and 1 have a degree higher than the other's, hence we skip this edge.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <0, 5, 7>.
