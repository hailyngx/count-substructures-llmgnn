Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each vertex based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 2: 4 edges
- Node 3: 1 edge
- Node 6: 1 edge
- Node 7: 4 edges
- Node 8: 4 edges
- Node 9: 1 edge

Sorted by degree:
- Node 3: 1 edge
- Node 6: 1 edge
- Node 9: 1 edge
- Node 0: 2 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 2: 4 edges
- Node 7: 4 edges
- Node 8: 4 edges

Now, following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will explore each edge starting from the nodes with lower degrees.

By traversing through the edges based on the node order:
1. Edge between nodes 0 and 3 forms a triangle with node 7 <0, 3, 7>.
2. Edge between nodes 1 and 7 forms a triangle with node 8 <1, 7, 8>.
3. Edge between nodes 9 and 1 forms a triangle with node 8 <1, 8, 9>.
4. Edge between nodes 2 and 6 does not form a triangle.
5. Edge between nodes 7 and 2 forms a triangle with node 8 <2, 7, 8>.

Unique Triangles: <0, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 8, 9>
