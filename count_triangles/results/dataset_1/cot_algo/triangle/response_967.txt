Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 3: 1 connection  
Node 4: 1 connection  
Nodes 1, 7: 2 connections  
Nodes 0, 5, 6, 8: 3 connections  
Node 2: 6 connections  

Next, we relabel the vertices according to their degree:

Node 3: 0 connections → relabeled as 0  
Node 4: 0 connections → relabeled as 1  
Nodes 1, 7: 2 connections → relabeled as 2, 3  
Nodes 0, 5, 6, 8: 3 connections → relabeled as 4, 5, 6, 7  
Node 2: 6 connections → relabeled as 8  

Now, let's analyze the edges and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2):
   - Node 0 (label 4) and Node 2 (label 8) share connections with Node 7 (label 3).
   => Triangle <0, 2, 7>

2. Edge (0, 7):
   - Node 0 (label 4) and Node 7 (label 3) share connections with Node 2 (label 8).
   => Triangle <0, 7, 2>

3. Edge (1, 2):
   - Node 1 (label 2) and Node 2 (label 8) do not form a triangle.

4. Edge (2, 0):
   - Node 2 (label 8) and Node 0 (label 4) share connections with Node 7 (label 3).
   => Triangle <2, 0, 7>

5. Edge (2, 1):
   - Node 2 (label 8) and Node 1 (label 2) do not form a triangle.

6. Edge (2, 5):
   - Node 2 (label 8) and Node 5 (label 5) do not form a triangle.

7. Edge (2, 6):
   - Node 2 (label 8) and Node 6 (label 6) do not form a triangle.

8. Edge (3, 4):
   - Node 3 (label 0) and Node 4 (label 1) do not form a triangle.

9. Edge (4, 3):
   - Node 4 (label 1) and Node 3 (label 0) do not form a triangle.

10. Edge (5, 2):
   - Node 5 (label 5) and Node 2 (label 8) do not form a triangle.

11. Edge (5, 8):
   - Node 5 (label 5) and Node 8 (label 7) do not form a triangle.

12. Edge (6, 2):
   - Node 6 (label 6) and Node 2 (label 8) do not form a triangle.

13. Edge (6, 8):
   - Node 6 (label 6) and Node 8 (label 7) do not form a triangle.

14. Edge (7, 0):
   - Node 7 (label 3) and Node 0 (label 4) share connections with Node 2 (label 8).
   => Triangle <7, 0, 2>

15. Edge (8, 5):
   - Node 8 (label 7) and Node 5 (label 5) do not form a triangle.

16. Edge (8, 6):
   - Node 8 (label 7) and Node 6 (label 6) do not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <0, 7, 2>, and <2, 0, 7>.
