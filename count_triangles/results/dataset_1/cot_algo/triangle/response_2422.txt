Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 

The vertices with their connections are as follows:
0: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 3 connections
4: 6 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 1 connection
9: 6 connections

Now, based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we should proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. By analyzing the given edges, we can find the triangles as follows:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
