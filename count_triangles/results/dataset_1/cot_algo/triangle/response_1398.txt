Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph with 10 nodes is as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles in the graph:
1. Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle with Nodes 0 and 2. Triangle <1, 6, 0>.
2. Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with Nodes 2 and 6. Triangle <0, 4, 6>.
3. Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with Nodes 2 and 6. Triangle <0, 7, 6>.
4. Edge (0, 2) also forms a triangle with Nodes 4 and 6. Triangle <0, 2, 4>.
5. Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with Nodes 2 and 7. Triangle <0, 3, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
