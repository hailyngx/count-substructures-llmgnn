Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 3: Degree 1
Vertex 0: Degree 3
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 4: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 5
Vertex 7: Degree 5
Vertex 8: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 6

We will now relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 3 (Label 0)
Vertex 0 (Label 1)
Vertex 5 (Label 2)
Vertex 4 (Label 3)
Vertex 6 (Label 4)
Vertex 9 (Label 5)
Vertex 1 (Label 6)
Vertex 7 (Label 7)
Vertex 8 (Label 8)
Vertex 2 (Label 9)

Now, we will count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:
Looking at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(1, 0) shares connection with 2 forming triangle <0, 1, 2>.
(6, 4) shares connection with 8 forming triangle <4, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
