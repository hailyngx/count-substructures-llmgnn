Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order. Then we relabel the nodes accordingly.

Node Degrees:
0: 3
1: 1
2: 1
3: 2
4: 3
5: 2
6: 4
7: 2
8: 3
9: 1

Sorted Nodes:
1 -> 2 -> 9 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 0 -> 4 -> 8 -> 6

Now, we will find triangles by checking shared connections between vertices along the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
[16]

Unique Triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
