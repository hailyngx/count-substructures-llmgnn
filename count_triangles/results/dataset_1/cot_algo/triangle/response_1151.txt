Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 7 has 1 connection.
Node 9 has 1 connection.
Nodes 2 and 4 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 3 and 5 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 0 and 1 have 4 connections each.
Node 6 has 6 connections.
Node 8 has 5 connections.

After relabeling the nodes from least connections to most, we have the following order: 7, 9, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 1, 6, 8.

Now, we will check for triangles:

For edge (0, 4): No triangle.
For edge (0, 6): Triangle formed with node 4: <0, 4, 6>.
For edge (1, 3): No triangle.
For edge (1, 5): Triangle formed with node 6: <1, 5, 6>.
For edge (1, 8): No triangle.
For edge (2, 6): No triangle.
For edge (3, 1): No triangle.
For edge (4, 0): No triangle.
For edge (5, 1): Triangle formed with node 6: <1, 5, 6>.
For edge (5, 6): Triangle formed with node 1: <1, 5, 6>.
For edge (5, 8): No triangle.
For edge (6, 0): Triangle formed with node 4: <0, 4, 6>.
For edge (6, 2): No triangle.
For edge (6, 5): Triangle formed with node 1: <1, 5, 6>.
For edge (6, 8): No triangle.
For edge (7, 9): No triangle.
For edge (8, 1): No triangle.
For edge (8, 5): Triangle formed with node 6: <1, 5, 6>.
For edge (8, 6): No triangle.
For edge (9, 7): No triangle.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [4], and the unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>.
