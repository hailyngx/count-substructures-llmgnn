Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The sorted vertex ordering is as follows: 

Vertices: 0 < 4 < 6 < 8 < 9 < 5 < 1 < 3

By following the rule of proceeding only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

Triangles: 
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
