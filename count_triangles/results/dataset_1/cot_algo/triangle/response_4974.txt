Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3

Sorting the nodes by degree in ascending order:
Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, Node 2, Node 3, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 0, Node 6

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Checking edges with the smallest degree node, Node 1: (1, 0) cannot form a triangle since Node 0 does not have a connection with Node 2.
- Checking edges with the next smallest degree node, Node 4: (4, 0) and (4, 3) can form a triangle at Node 0.
- Checking edges with the next smallest degree node, Node 5: No triangles can be formed with Node 5.
- Checking edges with Node 2: (2, 3) can form a triangle at Node 3.
- Checking edges with Node 3: No triangles can be formed with Node 3.
- Checking edges with Node 7: (7, 2) cannot form a triangle since Node 2 does not have a connection with Node 6.
- Checking edges with Node 8: (8, 2) can form a triangle at Node 2.
- Checking edges with Node 9: No triangles can be formed with Node 9.
- Checking edges with Node 0: No further triangles can be formed with Node 0.
- Checking edges with Node 6: (6, 7) can form a triangle at Node 7.

Counted triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 4>, <2, 5, 7>
