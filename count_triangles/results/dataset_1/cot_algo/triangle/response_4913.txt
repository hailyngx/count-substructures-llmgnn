Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new numbering is:  

Node 4: 0 connections  
Nodes 6, 9: 1 connection  
Nodes 0, 3, 7: 3 connections  
Nodes 1, 6, 8: 4 connections  
Node 2: 5 connections  
Node 5: 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in this graph.  
The total number of triangles is: [18]  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 5>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<1, 3, 8>  
<2, 3, 8>  
<2, 6, 8>  
<2, 8, 9>  
<3, 7, 8>  
<4, 6, 2>  
<5, 7, 8>  
<5, 7, 3>  
<5, 8, 0>  
<5, 8, 1>  
<6, 2, 8>  
<7, 5, 8>  
<8, 5, 0>  
<8, 5, 1>  
<8, 7, 3>  
<8, 7, 5>
