Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on the number of connections as follows:
Vertex 7: 0 connections
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 6 connections
Vertex 0: 7 connections

Triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 4>
<4, 5, 3>
