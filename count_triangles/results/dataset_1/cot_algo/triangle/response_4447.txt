Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and then relabeling them accordingly.

The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
Nodes: 4, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 8, 6, 2, 0

Now, let's look at the edges and count the triangles formed:

(0, 1): No triangle
(0, 2): No triangle
(0, 8): Triangle <0, 2, 8>
(1, 0): No triangle
(1, 9): No triangle
(2, 0): No triangle
(2, 3): No triangle
(2, 6): No triangle
(3, 2): No triangle
(3, 8): Triangle <3, 0, 8>
(4, 7): No triangle
(5, 6): No triangle
(5, 8): No triangle
(6, 2): No triangle
(6, 5): No triangle
(6, 7): Triangle <6, 4, 7>
(6, 8): Triangle <6, 0, 8>
(6, 9): No triangle
(7, 4): No triangle
(7, 6): Triangle <7, 4, 6>
(8, 0): No triangle
(8, 3): Triangle <8, 0, 3>
(8, 5): No triangle
(8, 6): No triangle
(9, 1): No triangle
(9, 6): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [5] 
Triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <3, 0, 8>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 0, 8>, <7, 4, 6>
