Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, the vertices sorted by their number of connections are:

Node 5: 1 connection
Nodes 4, 7, 8: 2 connections
Nodes 2, 6: 3 connections
Nodes 1, 3, 9: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check each edge to count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 (degree 5) has more connections than Node 1 (degree 4). No triangle formed.
2. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 (degree 5) has more connections than Node 2 (degree 3). No triangle formed.
3. Edge (0, 3): Node 0 (degree 5) has more connections than Node 3 (degree 4). Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.
4. Edge (0, 6): Node 0 (degree 5) has more connections than Node 6 (degree 3). No triangle formed.
5. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 (degree 5) has more connections than Node 9 (degree 4). Triangle formed: <0, 3, 9>.
6. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 (degree 4) has more connections than Node 5 (degree 1). No triangle formed.
7. Edge (1, 7): Node 1 (degree 4) has more connections than Node 7 (degree 2). No triangle formed.
8. Edge (1, 8): Node 1 (degree 4) has more connections than Node 8 (degree 2). No triangle formed.
9. Edge (2, 3): Node 2 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 3 (degree 4). No triangle formed.
10. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 4 (degree 2). No triangle formed.
11. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 (degree 4) has more connections than Node 6 (degree 3). No triangle formed.
12. Edge (4, 9): Node 4 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 9 (degree 4). No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3> and <0, 3, 9>.
