Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their number of connections are: 2, 9, 4, 7, 5, 1, 6, 0, 8, 3.

Now, we will iterate through the edges based on the vertices with lower labels having fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 1): Forms a triangle with node 5. Triangle: <0, 1, 5>.
- Edge (0, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (0, 8): Forms a triangle with node 3. Triangle: <0, 3, 8>.

- Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 6): No triangles formed.

- Edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.

- Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 9): Forms a triangle with node 6. Triangle: <3, 6, 9>.

- Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.

- Edge (5, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 4): No triangles formed.

- Edge (6, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 8): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9. Triangle: <0, 6, 9>.
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.

- Edge (7, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 8): Forms a triangle with node 3. Triangle: <3, 7, 8>.

- Edge (8, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 3): Forms a triangle with node 0. Triangle: <0, 3, 8>.
- Edge (8, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 9): Forms a triangle with node 3. Triangle: <3, 8, 9>.

- Edge (9, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 8): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 5. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, and <3, 7, 8>.
