Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labeling is as follows: 
Node 0 has degree 2,
Node 1 has degree 1,
Node 2 has degree 1,
Node 3 has degree 4,
Node 4 has degree 3,
Node 5 has degree 1,
Node 6 has degree 4,
Node 7 has degree 5,
Node 8 has degree 2,
Node 9 has degree 2.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 6)
(2, 6)
(3, 4)
(3, 7)
(3, 6)
(4, 8)
(5, 7)
(6, 9)
(7, 8)
(7, 5)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <0, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.
