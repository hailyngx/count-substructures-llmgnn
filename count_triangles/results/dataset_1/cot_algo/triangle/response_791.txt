Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each vertex:  
- Vertex 0: 2 connections  
- Vertex 1: 5 connections  
- Vertex 2: 2 connections  
- Vertex 3: 2 connections  
- Vertex 4: 2 connections  
- Vertex 5: 4 connections  
- Vertex 6: 3 connections  
- Vertex 7: 1 connection  
- Vertex 8: 4 connections  
- Vertex 9: 3 connections  
  
Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connections:  
- Vertex 7 (Degree: 1)  
- Vertex 0, 3, 4 (Degree: 2)    
- Vertex 6, 9 (Degree: 3)  
- Vertex 5, 8 (Degree: 4)  
- Vertex 1, 2 (Degree: 5)  
  
Now, we will go through each edge considering the vertex with the lower label first:  
- Check edge (0, 9): No triangle as both vertices have two connections.  
- Check edge (1, 2): Triangle formed with vertex 1, 2, and 4. <1, 2, 4>  
- Check edge (1, 6): No triangle as 1 has 5 connections while 6 has 3 connections.  
- Check edge (1, 7): No triangle as 1 has 5 connections while 7 has 1 connection.  
- Check edge (1, 8): Triangle formed with vertex 1, 8, and 5. <1, 5, 8>  
- Check edge (2, 4): No triangle as both vertices have two connections.  
- Check edge (3, 5): No triangle as both vertices have two connections.  
- Check edge (5, 6): No triangle as 5 has 4 connections while 6 has 3 connections.  
- Check edge (5, 8): Triangle formed with vertex 5, 8, and 1. <1, 5, 8>  
- Check edge (6, 1): Triangle formed with vertex 6, 1, and 5. <1, 5, 6>  
- Check edge (6, 5): No triangle as 6 has 3 connections while 5 has 4 connections.  
- Check edge (7, 1): No triangle as 1 has 5 connections while 7 has 1 connection.  
- Check edge (8, 1): Triangle formed with vertex 8, 1, and 5. <1, 5, 8>  
- Check edge (8, 5): Triangle formed with vertex 8, 5, and 1. <1, 5, 8>  
- Check edge (8, 9): No triangle as 8 has 4 connections while 9 has 3 connections.  
- Check edge (9, 0): No triangle as both vertices have two connections.  
- Check edge (9, 8): No triangle as 9 has 3 connections while 8 has 4 connections.
