Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be: 

Node 0 - 3 connections
Node 1 - 2 connections
Node 7 - 1 connection
Node 5 - 4 connections
Node 3 - 2 connections
Node 9 - 4 connections
Node 6 - 3 connections
Node 4 - 4 connections
Node 2 - 6 connections
Node 8 - 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge:

1. (0, 1) - Nodes 0 and 1 do not share any common connections.
2. (0, 5) - Nodes 0 and 5 share Node 2 as a common connection, forming a triangle {0, 2, 5}.
3. (0, 8) - Nodes 0 and 8 do not share any common connections.
4. (1, 8) - Nodes 1 and 8 do not share any common connections.
5. (2, 3) - Nodes 2 and 3 do not share any common connections.
6. (2, 4) - Nodes 2 and 4 do not share any common connections.
7. (2, 5) - Nodes 2 and 5 do not share any common connections.
8. (2, 6) - Nodes 2 and 6 do not share any common connections.
9. (2, 7) - Nodes 2 and 7 do not share any common connections.
10. (2, 9) - Nodes 2 and 9 share Nodes 4 and 6 as common connections, forming two triangles {2, 4, 9} and {2, 6, 9}.
11. (3, 4) - Nodes 3 and 4 do not share any common connections.
12. (4, 8) - Nodes 4 and 8 do not share any common connections.
13. (4, 9) - Nodes 4 and 9 share Node 2 as a common connection, forming a triangle {2, 4, 9}.
14. (5, 2) - Already counted in edge (0, 5).
15. (5, 6) - Nodes 5 and 6 do not share any common connections.
16. (6, 9) - Nodes 6 and 9 do not share any common connections.
17. (8, 0) - Already counted in edge (0, 8).
18. (8, 1) - Already counted in edge (1, 8).
19. (8, 4) - Nodes 8 and 4 do not share any common connections.
20. (9, 2) - Already counted in edge (2, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 9>, and <2, 6, 9>.
