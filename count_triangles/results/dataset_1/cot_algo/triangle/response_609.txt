Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees from least to most, the new labels for the vertices will be as follows:
Node 3 (degree 2) -> New Label 0
Node 6 (degree 2) -> New Label 1
Node 7 (degree 2) -> New Label 2
Node 5 (degree 3) -> New Label 3
Node 4 (degree 3) -> New Label 4
Node 1 (degree 4) -> New Label 5
Node 8 (degree 5) -> New Label 6
Node 9 (degree 5) -> New Label 7
Node 2 (degree 6) -> New Label 8
Node 0 (degree 6) -> New Label 9

Now, we can analyze each edge starting from the one with the lower label to count the triangles:
1. (0, 1): No triangle.
2. (0, 4): No triangle.
3. (0, 9): No triangle.
4. (1, 2): No triangle.
5. (1, 3): No triangle.
6. (2, 5): No triangle.
7. (2, 6): No triangle.
8. (2, 8): Triangle <2, 6, 8>.
9. (2, 9): No triangle.
10. (3, 7): No triangle.
11. (3, 8): No triangle.
12. (4, 8): Triangle <4, 8, 1>.
13. (5, 8): Triangle <5, 8, 2>.
14. (7, 9): No triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <2, 6, 8>, <4, 8, 1>, and <5, 8, 2>.
