Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 2, 1, 0, 3, 8, 4, 6, 7, 9, 5
