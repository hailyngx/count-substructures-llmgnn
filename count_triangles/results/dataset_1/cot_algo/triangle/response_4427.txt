Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Vertex 0 - degree 3 
Vertex 1 - degree 6 
Vertex 2 - degree 1 
Vertex 3 - degree 3 
Vertex 4 - degree 2 
Vertex 5 - degree 3 
Vertex 6 - degree 3 
Vertex 7 - degree 2 
Vertex 9 - degree 4 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order: 
(2, 1), (4, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (3, 0), (9, 0), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (6, 5), (7, 6), (9, 4), (3, 9)

By examining the shared connections for each edge, we find the following triangles: 
<1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
