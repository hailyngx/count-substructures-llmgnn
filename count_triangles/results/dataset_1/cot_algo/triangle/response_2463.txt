Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 3 with degree 1
- Vertex 2 with degree 2
- Vertex 5 with degree 3
- Vertex 6 with degree 2
- Vertex 9 with degree 2
- Vertex 8 with degree 3
- Vertex 7 with degree 4
- Vertex 1 with degree 5
- Vertex 0 with degree 5
- Vertex 4 with degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge accordingly:

1. Edge (0, 1) with labels (5, 5) does not form a triangle.
2. Edge (0, 4) with labels (5, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection (4).
3. Edge (0, 7) with labels (5, 4) does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (0, 8) with labels (5, 3) does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (0, 9) with labels (5, 2) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (1, 4) with labels (5, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection (4).
7. Edge (1, 5) with labels (5, 3) does not form a triangle.
8. Edge (1, 6) with labels (5, 2) does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (1, 7) with labels (5, 4) does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (2, 4) with labels (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
11. Edge (2, 8) with labels (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
12. Edge (3, 7) with labels (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
13. Edge (4, 5) with labels (6, 3) does not form a triangle.
14. Edge (4, 7) with labels (6, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection (7).
15. Edge (5, 7) with labels (3, 4) does not form a triangle.
16. Edge (6, 9) with labels (2, 2) does not form a triangle.

Counting the total number of triangles from the edges that formed triangles, we get:
- Total number of triangles: [2]

The unique triangles found are:
- Triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>
