Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0 - degree 4
Vertex 1 - degree 3
Vertex 2 - degree 1
Vertex 3 - degree 5
Vertex 4 - degree 4
Vertex 5 - degree 3
Vertex 6 - degree 4
Vertex 7 - degree 3
Vertex 8 - degree 3
Vertex 9 - degree 4

Based on the method, we will re-label the vertices as follows:
Vertex 2 -> A
Vertex 1 -> B
Vertex 5 -> C
Vertex 8 -> D
Vertex 7 -> E
Vertex 9 -> F
Vertex 4 -> G
Vertex 0 -> H
Vertex 6 -> I
Vertex 3 -> J

Calculating the triangles based on the given edges, we find the following triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 5]
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
