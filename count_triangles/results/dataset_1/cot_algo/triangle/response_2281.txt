Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 7: degree 6
Node 4: degree 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can identify the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 1>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
4. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
6. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
8. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
9. Triangle <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
