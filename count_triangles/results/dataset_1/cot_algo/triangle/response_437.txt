Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on the number of connections:  

- Node 0 has 2 connections.
- Nodes 2, 4, and 8 have 2 connections.
- Nodes 3 and 6 have 3 connections.
- Nodes 1, 5, and 9 have 4 connections.
- Node 7 has 5 connections.

Now, we relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Node 0 is now labeled as Node 0 (2 connections).
- Nodes 2, 4, and 8 are labeled as Node 1 (2 connections).
- Nodes 3 and 6 are labeled as Node 2 (3 connections).
- Nodes 1, 5, and 9 are labeled as Node 3 (4 connections).
- Node 7 is labeled as Node 4 (5 connections).

Now we will count the triangles:
- Node 0 (2 connections) does not form any triangles.
- Node 1 (labeled 2, 2 connections) does not form any triangles.
- Node 2 (labeled 3, 3 connections) forms triangle <3, 6, 5>.
- Node 3 (labeled 4, 4 connections) forms triangles <1, 5, 9> and <1, 5, 6>.
- Node 4 (labeled 2, 2 connections) does not form any triangles.
- Node 5 (labeled 3, 4 connections) forms triangle <3, 6, 2>.
- Node 6 (labeled 2, 3 connections) forms triangle <3, 5, 1>.
- Node 7 (labeled 4, 5 connections) forms triangles <3, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, and <1, 5, 2>.
- Node 8 (labeled 2, 2 connections) does not form any triangles.
- Node 9 (labeled 3, 4 connections) forms triangle <3, 5, 1>.

Counting the total number of triangles, we have:  
Total number of triangles: [9]
