Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

Vertex 0 has degree 1  
Vertex 1 has degree 1  
Vertex 6 has degree 1  
Vertex 8 has degree 2  
Vertex 4 has degree 3  
Vertex 5 has degree 3  
Vertex 6 has degree 1  
Vertex 7 has degree 4  
Vertex 3 has degree 5  
Vertex 9 has degree 5  

Sorting by degree we have the new labels:  
Vertex 0 -> 0  
Vertex 1 -> 1  
Vertex 6 -> 2  
Vertex 8 -> 3  
Vertex 4 -> 4  
Vertex 5 -> 5  
Vertex 6 -> 6  
Vertex 7 -> 7  
Vertex 3 -> 8  
Vertex 9 -> 9  

Now we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
