Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 1

After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we get the following relabeling:
- Vertex 9 (degree 1) becomes vertex 1
- Vertex 4 (degree 2) becomes vertex 2
- Vertex 7 (degree 3) becomes vertex 3
- Vertex 2 (degree 3) becomes vertex 4
- Vertex 1 (degree 2) becomes vertex 5
- Vertex 6 (degree 4) becomes vertex 6
- Vertex 3 (degree 4) becomes vertex 7
- Vertex 5 (degree 4) becomes vertex 8

Now, we will go through the edges in the order given and count the triangles formed:
1. Edge (1, 9): Both vertices have degree 1, so no triangles.
2. Edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 has degree 3 which is less than vertex 3's degree 4. They share vertex 6 as a common connection, thus forming a triangle: <2, 3, 6>.
3. Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 has degree 3 which is less than vertex 6's degree 4. They share vertex 3 as a common connection, forming a triangle: <2, 3, 6>.
4. Edge (3, 2): Skipped since we already counted it.
5. Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 has degree 4 which is greater than vertex 5's degree 4. No triangle formed.
6. Edge (3, 6): Skipped since we already counted it.
7. Edge (4, 5): Both vertices have degree 2, so no triangles.
8. Edge (5, 3): Skipped since we already counted it.
9. Edge (5, 4): Both vertices have degree 4. No triangles.
10. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has degree 4 which is less than vertex 7's degree 3. They share vertex 3 as a common connection, forming a triangle: <5, 3, 7>.
11. Edge (6, 2): Skipped since we already counted it.
12. Edge (6, 3): Skipped since we already counted it.
13. Edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 has degree 4 which is equal to vertex 7's degree 3. They share vertex 3 as a common connection, forming a triangle: <6, 3, 7>.
14. Edge (7, 5): Skipped since we already counted it.
15. Edge (7, 6): Skipped since we already counted it.
16. Edge (9, 1): Both vertices have degree 1, so no triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <2, 3, 6>, <5, 3, 7>, and <6, 3, 7>.
