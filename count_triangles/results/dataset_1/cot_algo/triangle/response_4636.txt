Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.

So, the sorted labels for the nodes are: 1, 7, 5, 2, 8, 6, 9, 1, 3, 4.

Now, checking for triangles formed by the edges based on the labels:

- Edge (0, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle <0, 6, 4>.
- Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 0) forms a triangle <4, 0, 6>.
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 5) does not form a triangle.

The triangles found are <0, 6, 4> and <1, 3, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
