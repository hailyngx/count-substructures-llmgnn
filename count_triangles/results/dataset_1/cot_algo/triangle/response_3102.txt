Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most connections, we get the following order: 3, 7, 2, 8, 5, 1, 4, 6, 9, 0.

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. Node 3 is connected to node 6 and node 5, which are not connected. No triangle.
2. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 5. They are connected, forming a triangle: <1, 5, 7>.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 0 which is also connected to nodes 1 and 9. This forms a triangle: <0, 1, 2>.
4. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5. Nodes 0 and 4 are directly connected, completing the triangle: <0, 4, 8>.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. There are three triangles here: 
   - <6, 7, 5>
   - <5, 8, 9>
   - <5, 7, 9>
6. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9. We already counted the triangle involving nodes 0, 1, and 9, so no new triangle here.
7. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 8 which are already part of the triangle involving node 0, 4, and 8.
8. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5. We already counted the triangles involving these nodes, so no new triangle.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 5. There are two more triangles here:
   - <0, 4, 9>
   - <5, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
