Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of connections each node has:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection

Next, let's reorder the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes in order: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9, 3, 5, 4, 6, 1

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering:

Triangles:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [2]
