Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 4 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 6 and 7 have 1 connection each.
- Nodes 5 and 9 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 1 and 3 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 0 and 2 have 4 connections each.
- Node 8 has 5 connections.

Now, we can iterate through each edge and count the number of triangles:
- Edge (0, 1): Shared connections with node 0: [2, 8], Shared connections with node 1: [2, 3, 9]. Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with node 0: [1, 8], Shared connections with node 2: [1, 5, 7, 9]. Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (0, 8): Shared connections with node 0: [1, 2], Shared connections with node 8: [3, 7]. No triangles found.
- Edge (1, 2): Shared connections with node 1: [0, 3, 9], Shared connections with node 2: [0, 5, 7, 9]. Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (1, 3): Shared connections with node 1: [2, 9], Shared connections with node 3: [2, 5, 6, 8]. No triangles found.
- Edge (1, 9): Shared connections with node 1: [0, 2, 3], Shared connections with node 9: [0, 2]. Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 9>.
- Edge (2, 5): Shared connections with node 2: [1, 7, 9], Shared connections with node 5: [3]. No triangles found.
- Edge (2, 7): Shared connections with node 2: [1, 5, 9], Shared connections with node 7: [8]. No triangles found.
- Edge (2, 9): Shared connections with node 2: [1, 5, 7], Shared connections with node 9: [1]. No triangles found.
- Edge (3, 5): Shared connections with node 3: [1, 6, 8], Shared connections with node 5: [2]. No triangles found.
- Edge (3, 6): Shared connections with node 3: [5], Shared connections with node 6: [3]. No triangles found.
- Edge (3, 8): Shared connections with node 3: [1, 6], Shared connections with node 8: [0, 7]. No triangles found.
- Edge (5, 2): Shared connections with node 5: [3], Shared connections with node 2: [1, 7, 9]. No triangles found.
- Edge (7, 2): Shared connections with node 7: [8], Shared connections with node 2: [1, 5, 9]. No triangles found.
- Edge (7, 8): Shared connections with node 7: [2], Shared connections with node 8: [0, 3]. No triangles found.
- Edge (8, 0): Shared connections with node 8: [3, 7], Shared connections with node 0: [1, 2]. No triangles found.
- Edge (8, 3): Shared connections with node 8: [0, 7], Shared connections with node 3: [1, 6]. No triangles found.
- Edge (8, 7): Shared connections with node 8: [2], Shared connections with node 7: [2]. No triangles found.
- Edge (9, 1): Shared connections with node 9: [0, 2], Shared connections with node 1: [0, 2, 3]. Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 9>.
- Edge (9, 2): Shared connections with node 9: [1], Shared connections with node 2: [1, 5, 7]. No triangles found.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 9>.
