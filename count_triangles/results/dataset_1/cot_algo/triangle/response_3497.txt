Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 9: 4 connections

Sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, we have:
Nodes: 8, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 1, 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the order provided:
1. Edge (8, 7): Ignore as both nodes have degree 1.
2. Edge (3, 7): Ignore as both nodes have degree 2.
3. Edge (5, 1): Ignore as both nodes have degree 2.
4. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 has degree 3, Node 1 has degree 4. Check shared connections: Node 0 connects with Node 7, and Node 1 connects with Node 5 and Node 9. So, we find the triangle <0, 1, 5>.
5. Edge (2, 1): Node 2 has degree 3, Node 1 has degree 4. Check shared connections: Node 2 connects with Node 5, and Node 1 connects with Node 0 and Node 4. So, we find the triangle <0, 1, 2>.
6. Edge (4, 1): Node 4 has degree 3, Node 1 has degree 4. Check shared connections: Node 4 connects with Node 6 and Node 7, and Node 1 connects with Node 5 and Node 0. So, we find the triangle <0, 1, 4>.
7. Edge (6, 2): Node 6 has degree 4, Node 2 has degree 3. Check shared connections: Node 6 connects with Node 9, and Node 2 connects with Node 5. So, we find the triangle <2, 6, 9>.
8. Edge (4, 6): Node 4 has degree 3, Node 6 has degree 4. Check shared connections: Node 4 connects with Node 7, and Node 6 connects with Node 9 and Node 2. So, we find the triangle <2, 4, 6>.
9. Edge (6, 9): Node 6 has degree 4, Node 9 has degree 4. Check shared connections: Node 6 connects with Node 2, and Node 9 connects with Node 0 and Node 3. So, we find the triangle <0, 6, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 9>.
