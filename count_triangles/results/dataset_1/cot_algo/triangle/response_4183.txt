Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 6 have degree 2
- Nodes 5 and 7 have degree 3
- Nodes 0 and 4 have degree 6
- Node 9 has degree 7

Now, we will consider each edge using the degree-based ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. (8, 2): No triangles are formed with this edge.
2. (1, 3): No triangles are formed with this edge.
3. (5, 7): Triangle <5, 0, 7> is formed.
4. (1, 4): No triangles are formed with this edge.
5. (0, 1): No triangles are formed with this edge.
6. (9, 5): Triangle <9, 0, 5> is formed.
7. (2, 0): Triangle <2, 0, 3> is formed.
8. (9, 6): Triangle <9, 0, 6> is formed.
9. (7, 9): Triangle <7, 0, 5> is formed.
10. (0, 4): Triangle <0, 4, 1> is formed.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are <5, 0, 7>, <9, 0, 5>, <2, 0, 3>, <9, 0, 6>, and <0, 4, 1>.
