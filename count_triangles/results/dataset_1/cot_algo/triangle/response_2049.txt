Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the nodes by their number of connections:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Next, we relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 0 -> Node 0
Node 3 -> Node 1
Node 5 -> Node 2
Node 8 -> Node 3
Node 1 -> Node 4
Node 7 -> Node 5
Node 4 -> Node 6
Node 6 -> Node 7
Node 2 -> Node 8
Node 9 -> Node 9

Now, we go through each edge following the rules described in the method. 
The total number of triangles is [<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>] = [8].
