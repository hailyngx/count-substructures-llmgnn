Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in increasing order. 

The vertices with their corresponding degrees are as follows:
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 6 connections

Following the degree-based ordering, we will start with the edges involving vertices with the least connections.

Going through the edges in this order, we find the following triangles: 
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 0, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 0, 8>
<7, 4, 5>
<7, 5, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
