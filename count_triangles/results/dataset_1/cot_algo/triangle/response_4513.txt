Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The vertices and their degrees in this graph are as follows:

- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 1
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 3

Since vertex 5 has the lowest degree, it will be assigned label 0. Then the vertices will be labeled in increasing order of their degrees. The new vertex labels are as follows:

- Vertex 5: label 0
- Vertex 3: label 1
- Vertex 6: label 2
- Vertex 7: label 3
- Vertex 8: label 4
- Vertex 9: label 5
- Vertex 1: label 6
- Vertex 2: label 7
- Vertex 0: label 8
- Vertex 4: label 9

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will now count the number of triangles present in the graph:

- Triangle 1: <5, 9, 6>
- Triangle 2: <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle 3: <1, 0, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
