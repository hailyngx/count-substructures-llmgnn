Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices is as follows:
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5

Using these labels and the given edges, we can count the triangles:
- Triangle <1, 2, 3> (Node 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle)
- Triangle <1, 4, 6> (Node 1, 4, and 6 form a triangle)
- Triangle <1, 4, 9> (Node 1, 4, and 9 form a triangle)
- Triangle <1, 6, 9> (Node 1, 6, and 9 form a triangle)
- Triangle <4, 6, 9> (Node 4, 6, and 9 form a triangle)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
