Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted vertices are as follows:
Vertices with 1 connection: 8
Vertices with 2 connections: 1, 4
Vertices with 3 connections: 5, 8
Vertices with 4 connections: 6, 9
Vertices with 5 connections: 2
Vertices with 6 connections: 3, 7

Now, we proceed with the edges in the order given, only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. Edge (1, 3): Forms the triangle <1, 3, 7>.
2. Edge (1, 7): Does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (2, 3): Does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (2, 5): Does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (2, 8): Does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (3, 1): Already counted.
7. Edge (3, 2): Already counted.
8. Edge (3, 6): Forms the triangle <1, 3, 6>.
9. Edge (3, 7): Already counted.
10. Edge (4, 7): Does not form a triangle.
11. Edge (4, 9): Forms the triangle <4, 6, 9>.
12. Edge (5, 2): Does not form a triangle.
13. Edge (5, 6): Forms the triangle <2, 5, 6>.
14. Edge (6, 3): Already counted.
15. Edge (6, 5): Already counted.
16. Edge (6, 9): Already counted.
17. Edge (7, 1): Already counted.
18. Edge (7, 3): Already counted.
19. Edge (7, 4): Does not form a triangle.
20. Edge (7, 9): Forms the triangle <4, 7, 9>.
21. Edge (8, 2): Does not form a triangle.
22. Edge (9, 4): Already counted.
23. Edge (9, 6): Already counted.
24. Edge (9, 7): Already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4], and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, and <2, 5, 6>.
