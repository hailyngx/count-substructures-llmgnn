Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 

Vertex 1: 3 connections <1, 3, 4>
Vertex 3: 1 connection <1>
Vertex 5: 3 connections <0, 2, 7>
Vertex 7: 1 connection <5>
Vertex 6: 1 connection <8>
Vertex 0: 3 connections <5, 8, 9>
Vertex 2: 4 connections <1, 4, 5, 9>
Vertex 4: 3 connections <1, 2, 8>
Vertex 8: 4 connections <0, 6, 9, 4>
Vertex 9: 4 connections <0, 2, 8, 9>

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will go through the edges to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 5): Forms triangle with vertex 2 <0, 2, 5>
2. Edge (0, 8): Forms triangle with vertices 4 and 9 <0, 4, 8>
3. Edge (0, 9): Forms triangle with vertices 2 and 8 <0, 2, 9>
4. Edge (1, 2): No triangle
5. Edge (1, 3): No triangle
6. Edge (1, 4): Forms triangle with vertex 0 <0, 1, 4>
7. Edge (2, 1): No triangle
8. Edge (2, 4): No triangle
9. Edge (2, 5): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 9 <0, 2, 5>
10. Edge (2, 9): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 5 <0, 2, 9>
11. Edge (3, 1): No triangle
12. Edge (4, 1): Forms triangle with vertex 0 <0, 1, 4>
13. Edge (4, 2): No triangle
14. Edge (5, 0): Forms triangle with vertices 2 and 9 <0, 2, 5>
15. Edge (5, 2): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 9 <0, 2, 5>
16. Edge (5, 7): No triangle
17. Edge (6, 8): No triangle
18. Edge (7, 5): No triangle
19. Edge (8, 0): Forms triangle with vertices 4 and 9 <0, 4, 8>
20. Edge (8, 6): No triangle
21. Edge (8, 9): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 4 <0, 4, 8>
22. Edge (9, 0): Forms triangle with vertices 2 and 5 <0, 2, 5>
23. Edge (9, 2): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 5 <0, 2, 5>
24. Edge (9, 8): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 4 <0, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
