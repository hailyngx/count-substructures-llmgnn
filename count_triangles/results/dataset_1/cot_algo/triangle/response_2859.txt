Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, and relabeling them accordingly, the new order is: 

Nodes: 7, 0, 5, 1, 4, 3, 6, 2, 9, 8

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles by examining each edge:

1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 has 3 connections, Node 2 has 4 connections:
   Nodes 0 and 2 share 1 common connection: Node 6.
   
2. Edge (0, 6): Node 0 has 3 connections, Node 6 has 4 connections:
   Nodes 0 and 6 share 1 common connection: Node 4.

3. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 has 3 connections, Node 2 has 4 connections:
   Nodes 1 and 2 share 2 common connections: Nodes 9 and 0.
   
4. Edge (1, 3): Node 1 has 3 connections, Node 3 has 3 connections:
   Nodes 1 and 3 share 1 common connection: Node 9.

5. Edge (1, 8): Node 1 has 3 connections, Node 8 has 5 connections:
   Nodes 1 and 8 share 2 common connections: Nodes 4 and 6.
   
6. Edge (2, 0): Node 2 has 4 connections, Node 0 has 3 connections:
   Nodes 2 and 0 share 1 common connection: Node 6.
   
7. Edge (2, 1): Node 2 has 4 connections, Node 1 has 3 connections:
   Nodes 2 and 1 share 2 common connections: Nodes 9 and 0.
   
8. Edge (2, 9): Node 2 has 4 connections, Node 9 has 5 connections:
   Nodes 2 and 9 share 2 common connections: Nodes 1 and 0.

9. Edge (3, 1): Node 3 has 3 connections, Node 1 has 3 connections:
   Nodes 3 and 1 share 1 common connection: Node 9.

10. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has 3 connections, Node 4 has 4 connections:
    Nodes 3 and 4 share 1 common connection: Node 6.

... (continuing for all 30 edges)

After examining all edges and identifying triangles based on shared connections, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: 
[21]

Some of the unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 1, 9>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
... (and more)
