Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes will be as follows: 

Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check each edge to count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): No triangle formed.
2. Edge (0, 4): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (0, 5): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (0, 7): Triangle formed <0, 4, 7>.
5. Edge (0, 9): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (2, 9): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (3, 7): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (5, 6): Triangle formed <5, 6, 0>.
15. Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (7, 3): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (8, 4): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (9, 2): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2, and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7> and <5, 6, 0>. 

Output: [2]
