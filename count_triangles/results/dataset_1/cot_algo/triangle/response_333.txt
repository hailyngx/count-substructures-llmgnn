Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 7 (0 connections)
- Node 2 (1 connection)
- Node 5 (1 connection)
- Node 4 (2 connections)
- Node 3 (3 connections)
- Node 6 (4 connections)
- Node 1 (5 connections)
- Node 9 (6 connections)
- Node 8 (6 connections)
- Node 0 (6 connections)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will investigate the edges in the following order:
(2, 9), (3, 4), (5, 8), (0, 1), (6, 1), (8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 2), (4, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (8, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (6, 9), (3, 8), (8, 5), (9, 1)

After examining these edges, we find the following unique triangles:
- <3, 4, 9>
- <4, 9, 6>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <3, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
