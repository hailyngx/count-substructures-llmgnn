Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes based on their degree:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 1
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 2

Now, we will relabel the nodes from 0 to 7 based on their degree:

Node 0 (degree 1) -> Node 0
Node 1 (degree 1) -> Node 1
Node 5 (degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 9 (degree 2) -> Node 3
Node 3 (degree 3) -> Node 4
Node 6 (degree 3) -> Node 5
Node 8 (degree 3) -> Node 6
Node 2 (degree 4) -> Node 7

Now, let's list the edges based on the new labels:
(0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Number of triangles: 2]
<2, 4, 6> 
<2, 5, 6>
