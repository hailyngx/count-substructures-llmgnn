Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Here is the updated list of vertices after sorting:

Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections

Now, we will check the edges starting with the vertices with the lower label and fewer connections. 

After analyzing the graph based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find that there are:
[12] triangles in total.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 4, 6>
<5, 4, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 1, 9>
<8, 7, 9>
