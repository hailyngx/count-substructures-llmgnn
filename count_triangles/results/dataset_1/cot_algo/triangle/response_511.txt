Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree):
    - Vertex 0: degree 2
    - Vertex 2: degree 2
    - Vertex 5: degree 2
    - Vertex 6: degree 3
    - Vertex 9: degree 4
    - Vertex 8: degree 4
    - Vertex 1: degree 4
    - Vertex 7: degree 4
    - Vertex 3: degree 4
    - Vertex 4: degree 5

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
    - Vertex 0: degree 2 -> relabeled as Vertex 1
    - Vertex 2: degree 2 -> relabeled as Vertex 2
    - Vertex 5: degree 2 -> relabeled as Vertex 3
    - Vertex 6: degree 3 -> relabeled as Vertex 4
    - Vertex 9: degree 4 -> relabeled as Vertex 5
    - Vertex 8: degree 4 -> relabeled as Vertex 6
    - Vertex 1: degree 4 -> relabeled as Vertex 7
    - Vertex 7: degree 4 -> relabeled as Vertex 8
    - Vertex 3: degree 4 -> relabeled as Vertex 9
    - Vertex 4: degree 5 -> relabeled as Vertex 10

3. Check for triangles between vertices based on their labels and connections:
    - For each edge, we check if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
        - Edge (0, 5): Both have degree 2, we can proceed.
        - Edge (0, 6): Vertex 1 (0) has fewer connections, check shared connections.
            - Shared connections: Vertex 3 (5)
        - Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 (1) has fewer connections, check shared connections.
            - Shared connections: Vertex 2 (3)
        - Continuing this process for all edges...

After counting all triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
