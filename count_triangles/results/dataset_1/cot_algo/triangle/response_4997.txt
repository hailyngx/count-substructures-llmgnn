Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph:

Vertices sorted by degree:
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with node 0: {3, 6}. Triangle <0, 2, 3>.
2. Edge (0, 3): Shared connections with node 0: {2, 6}. Triangle <0, 2, 3>.
3. Edge (0, 4): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (0, 6): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (2, 0): No need to reprocess since (0, 2) already handled.
7. Edge (2, 3): Shared connections with node 2: {0}. Triangle <0, 2, 3>.
8. Edge (3, 0): No need to reprocess since (0, 3) already handled.
9. Edge (3, 2): No need to reprocess since (2, 3) already handled.
10. Edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (4, 0): No need to reprocess since (0, 4) already handled.
12. Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (5, 4): No need to reprocess since (4, 5) already handled.
14. Edge (6, 0): No need to reprocess since (0, 6) already handled.
15. Edge (6, 3): No need to reprocess since (3, 6) already handled.
16. Edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (8, 7): No need to reprocess since (7, 8) already handled.
20. Edge (9, 7): No need to reprocess since (7, 9) already handled.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 3>
