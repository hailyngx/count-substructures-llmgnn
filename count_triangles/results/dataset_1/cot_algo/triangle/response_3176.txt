Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 1
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4

Starting with the edges in order of their labels, we evaluate each edge to count the triangles:

For edge (0, 3):
Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 5, 7
Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 5, 7
Shared connections: 3, 5, 7
Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>

For edge (1, 6):
Node 1 has neighbors: 6
Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 9
No triangles formed.

For edge (2, 4):
Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 6
Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 8, 9
Shared connection: 2
Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>

For edge (3, 0):
Already counted with edge (0, 3).

For edge (3, 5):
Already counted with edge (0, 3).

For edge (4, 2):
Already counted with edge (2, 4).

For edge (4, 8):
Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 8, 9
Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 6, 9
Shared connection: 4, 8, 9
Triangle formed: <4, 8, 9>

For edge (5, 0):
Already counted with edge (0, 3).

For edge (5, 3):
Already counted with edge (0, 3).

For edge (6, 1):
Already counted with edge (1, 6).

For edge (6, 2):
Already counted with edge (2, 4).

For edge (6, 8):
Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 9
Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 6, 9
Shared connection: 6, 8, 9
Triangle formed: <6, 8, 9>

For edge (7, 0):
Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 5, 7
Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 9
Shared connection: 0, 3, 5
Triangle formed: <7, 0, 3>, <7, 0, 5>

For edge (7, 3):
Already counted with edge (0, 3).

For edge (7, 5):
Already counted with edge (0, 3).

For edge (8, 4):
Already counted with edge (4, 8).

For edge (8, 6):
Already counted with edge (6, 8).

For edge (8, 9):
Already counted with edge (4, 8) and (6, 8).

For edge (9, 4):
Already counted with edge (4, 8) and (6, 8).

For edge (9, 6):
Already counted with edge (6, 8).

For edge (9, 7):
Already counted with edge (7, 0).

For the given graph, the total number of triangles is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, and <7, 0, 3>.
