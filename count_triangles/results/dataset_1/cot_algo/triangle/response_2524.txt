Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
0 (1 connection)
5 (1 connection)
6 (2 connections)
2 (1 connection)
1 (3 connections)
4 (2 connections)
7 (4 connections)
8 (4 connections)
3 (4 connections)
9 (5 connections)
