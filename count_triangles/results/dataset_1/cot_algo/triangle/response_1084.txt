Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new order is: 4, 6, 0, 5, 9, 3, 1, 7, 2. 

Considering the edges in this order, we find the following triangles: 
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle <2, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
