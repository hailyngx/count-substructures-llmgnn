Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Vertex 2: 0 connections
Vertex 6: 0 connections
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections
Vertex 8: 6 connections

Triangles:
