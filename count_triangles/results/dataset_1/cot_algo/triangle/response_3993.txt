Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 6: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

Node 9 (1 connection)
Node 5 (1 connection)
Node 4 (1 connection)
Node 3 (1 connection)
Node 0 (2 connections)
Node 8 (3 connections)
Node 1 (3 connections)
Node 6 (4 connections)
Node 7 (4 connections)
Node 2 (6 connections)

We will now check the edges based on the ordering of vertices:

1. Edge (0, 7): Both nodes have 4 connections, so we proceed.
2. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 (3 connections) < Node 2 (6 connections), so we proceed.
3. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 (3 connections) < Node 6 (4 connections), so we proceed. Triangle found: <1, 2, 6>.
4. Edge (2, 1): Node 1 (3 connections) < Node 2 (6 connections), so we proceed.
5. Edge (2, 4): Node 4 (1 connection) < Node 2 (6 connections), so we proceed.
6. Edge (2, 5): Node 5 (1 connection) < Node 2 (6 connections), so we proceed.
7. Edge (2, 7): Node 7 (4 connections) < Node 2 (6 connections), so we proceed. Triangle found: <2, 7, 1>.
8. Edge (2, 9): Node 9 (1 connection) < Node 2 (6 connections), so we proceed.
9. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 (1 connection) < Node 6 (4 connections), so we proceed.
10. Edge (6, 1): Node 1 (3 connections) < Node 6 (4 connections), so we proceed.
11. Edge (6, 8): Node 8 (3 connections) < Node 6 (4 connections), so we proceed.
12. Edge (6, 3): Node 3 (1 connection) < Node 6 (4 connections), so we proceed. Triangle found: <6, 1, 3>.
13. Edge (6, 8): Node 8 (3 connections) < Node 6 (4 connections), so we proceed.
14. Edge (8, 7): Node 7 (4 connections) < Node 8 (3 connections), so we proceed.
15. Edge (8, 7): Node 7 (4 connections) < Node 8 (3 connections), so we proceed.
16. Edge (9, 2): Node 9 (1 connection) < Node 2 (6 connections), so we proceed.
