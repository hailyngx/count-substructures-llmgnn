Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on the number of connections they have:

Nodes ordered by number of connections:
Node 4: 2 connections
Nodes 0, 1, 3, 9: 0 connections
Nodes 6: 3 connections
Nodes 5: 4 connections
Nodes 2, 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections

We will now go through the edges and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Nodes 0 and 2 have 0 common connections.
2. Edge (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 have 1 common connection - Node 2.
3. Edge (1, 2): Nodes 1 and 2 have 0 common connections.
4. Edge (1, 6): Nodes 1 and 6 have 0 common connections.
5. Edge (2, 0): Already counted.
6. Edge (2, 1): Already counted.
7. Edge (2, 5): Nodes 2 and 5 have 1 common connection - Node 0.
8. Edge (2, 8): Nodes 2 and 8 have 2 common connections - Nodes 5 and 4.
9. Edge (3, 5): Nodes 3 and 5 have 0 common connections.
10. Edge (4, 7): Nodes 4 and 7 have 0 common connections.
11. Edge (4, 8): Nodes 4 and 8 have 1 common connection - Node 5.
12. Edge (5, 0): Already counted.
13. Edge (5, 2): Already counted.
14. Edge (5, 3): Already counted.
15. Edge (5, 8): Already counted.
16. Edge (6, 1): Already counted.
17. Edge (6, 7): Nodes 6 and 7 have 0 common connections.
18. Edge (6, 8): Nodes 6 and 8 have 1 common connection - Node 1.
19. Edge (7, 4): Already counted.
20. Edge (7, 6): Already counted.
21. Edge (7, 8): Nodes 7 and 8 have 2 common connections - Nodes 6 and 5.
22. Edge (7, 9): Nodes 7 and 9 have 0 common connections.
23. Edge (8, 2): Already counted.
24. Edge (8, 4): Already counted.
25. Edge (8, 5): Already counted.
26. Edge (8, 6): Already counted.
27. Edge (8, 7): Already counted.
28. Edge (9, 7): Already counted.
