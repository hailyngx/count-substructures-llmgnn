Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in increasing order, we can relabel them as follows:  
- Vertex 0 has degree 2  
- Vertex 1 has degree 1  
- Vertex 7 has degree 1  
- Vertex 5 has degree 2  
- Vertex 6 has degree 2  
- Vertex 2 has degree 3  
- Vertex 8 has degree 3  
- Vertex 9 has degree 4  
- Vertex 3 has degree 5  
- Vertex 4 has degree 6  

Since we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can focus on the following edges based on the relabeling:  
(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 6), (5, 8), (6, 8), (9, 2)

Let's count the triangles formed by these edges:  
- Triangle <0, 3, 4>  
- Triangle <5, 8, 6>  
- Triangle <2, 9, 3>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
