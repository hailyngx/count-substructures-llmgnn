Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 6 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 5 connections.
Therefore, the sorted nodes are: 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 0, 8, 5, 9.

Checking the edges with the lower labeled node having fewer connections:
(0, 4): Forms triangle <0, 4, 5>.
(0, 5): Forms triangle <0, 4, 5>.
(0, 7): No triangle formed.
(0, 8): No triangle formed.
(1, 5): No triangle formed.
(1, 7): No triangle formed.
(2, 4): Forms triangle <2, 4, 5>.
(3, 5): Forms triangle <3, 5, 4>.
(3, 9): No triangle formed.
(4, 0): No triangle formed.
(4, 2): No triangle formed.
(4, 5): No triangle formed.
(5, 0): No triangle formed.
(7, 0): No triangle formed.
(7, 1): No triangle formed.
(7, 8): No triangle formed.
(8, 0): No triangle formed.
(8, 7): No triangle formed.
(8, 9): No triangle formed.
(9, 3): No triangle formed.
(9, 6): No triangle formed.
(9, 8): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 4>.
