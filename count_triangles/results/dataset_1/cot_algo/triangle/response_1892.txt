Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
\[ 2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 9 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4 \]

We will now go through each edge with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 3): forms a triangle with shared connection 4. Triangle: <0, 3, 4>
2. Edge (0, 4): forms a triangle with shared connection 3. Triangle: <0, 4, 3>
3. Edge (1, 4): no triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 6): no triangle formed.
5. Edge (1, 7): no triangle formed.
6. Edge (1, 8): no triangle formed.
7. Edge (5, 2): no triangle formed.
8. Edge (6, 1): no triangle formed.
9. Edge (6, 7): no triangle formed.
10. Edge (6, 8): no triangle formed.
11. Edge (9, 3): no triangle formed.

The total number of triangles is: [2]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 4> <0, 4, 3>
