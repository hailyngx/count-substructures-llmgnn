Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each node:

- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:

1. Node 1: 2 connections
2. Node 4: 2 connections
3. Node 8: 2 connections
4. Node 2: 3 connections
5. Node 9: 3 connections
6. Node 0: 4 connections
7. Node 3: 4 connections
8. Node 5: 4 connections
9. Node 6: 4 connections
10. Node 7: 5 connections

We will now go through the edges one by one, considering only the ones where the lower-labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle with node 2 <0, 2, 3>
Edge (0, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 9 <0, 4, 5>
Edge (0, 6): Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 2 <0, 1, 6>
Edge (0, 8): No triangle formed
Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed
Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed
Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed
Edge (2, 6): No triangle formed
Edge (3, 7): Forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 9 <3, 5, 7>
Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed
Edge (4, 9): No triangle formed
Edge (5, 7): Forms a triangle with node 9 <5, 7, 9>
Edge (6, 8): No triangle formed
Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 4, 5>, and <3, 5, 7>.
