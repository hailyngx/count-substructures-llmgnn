Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the list will be: 0, 9, 2, 4, 7, 8, 5, 6, 1, 3.
