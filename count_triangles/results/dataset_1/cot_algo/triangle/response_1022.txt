Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the nodes based on their degree:
   Nodes sorted by degree: 4, 5, 9, 3, 8, 1, 6, 7, 2, 0

2. Relabel the nodes based on the sorted order:
   New labeling: 0 → 4, 1 → 5, 2 → 9, 3 → 3, 4 → 8, 5 → 1, 6 → 6, 7 → 7, 8 → 2, 9 → 0

3. Count the triangles formed:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 4, 9>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 4, 8>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 4, 7>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 5: <0, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 6: <4, 7, 8>
   - Triangle 7: <1, 5, 9>
