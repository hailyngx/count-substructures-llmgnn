Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have the following relabeled vertices: 

Node 3, 5, 8 have 0 connections
Node 0, 1, 9 have 2 connections
Node 4, 7 have 3 connections
Node 2, 6 have 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges in the following order:
(0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (0, 6) (1, 6) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 6) (6, 9) (7, 9)

By checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4> <0, 2, 6> <0, 4, 6> <1, 2, 6> <1, 4, 6> <0, 1, 7> <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
