Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:
Vertices: 0(2), 1(2), 2(2), 3(4), 4(1), 5(1), 6(2), 7(4), 8(2), 9(2)

The sorted vertices: 4, 5, 0, 1, 6, 2, 8, 9, 7, 3

Now, we will check the edges based on the vertex labeling and count the triangles:
- Edge (4, 9) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (0, 1) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (6, 0) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (2, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <2, 3, 7>.
- Edge (8, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <8, 3, 7>.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (1, 0) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 6) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (7, 2) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 4) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (0, 6) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (6, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <6, 3, 7>.
- Edge (2, 7) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 2) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <3, 8, 7>.
- Edge (7, 3) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (8, 7) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form any triangles.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <2, 3, 7>, <8, 3, 7>, <6, 3, 7>.
