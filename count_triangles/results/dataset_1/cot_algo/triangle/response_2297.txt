Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's relabel the vertices based on their degree as follows:
- Node 8 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 1, 3, 5, 7 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 0, 6 have 4 connections each.
- Nodes 2, 4, 9 have 6 connections each.

Next, we will count the triangles by examining each edge based on the relabeled vertices:

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <2, 4, 9>
5. <2, 6, 9>

Finally, count the total number of triangles: [5]
