Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: 
(0 - degree 5), 
(1 - degree 3), 
(2 - degree 3), 
(3 - degree 3), 
(4 - degree 2), 
(5 - degree 2), 
(6 - degree 6), 
(7 - degree 2), 
(8 - degree 2), 
(9 - degree 7).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:

1. Edge (4, 6): Forms triangle <4, 6, 9>.

2. Edge (5, 6): Forms triangle <5, 6, 9>.

3. Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed.

4. Edge (8, 9): No triangle formed.

5. Edge (2, 6): Forms triangle <2, 6, 9>.

6. Edge (1, 9): Forms triangle <1, 9, 6>.

7. Edge (0, 1): No triangle formed.

8. Edge (0, 2): No triangle formed.

9. Edge (6, 9): Forms triangle <6, 9, 1>.

10. Edge (2, 3): Forms triangle <2, 3, 0>.

11. Edge (6, 8): Forms triangle <6, 8, 9>.

12. Edge (3, 9): Forms triangle <3, 9, 1>.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
