Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
- Node 5 has 2 connections
- Node 1 has 2 connections
- Nodes 1 and 5 have 2 connections
- Nodes 3 and 6 have 3 connections
- Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7 have 4 connections
- Node 9 has 5 connections
- Node 8 has 5 connections
- Node 2 has 6 connections

With the labels reassigned, we can now count the triangles in the graph:

[7]

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
