Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertices: 3, 5
Vertices: 1, 5
Vertices: 0, 1, 2
Vertices: 4, 6, 8, 9
Vertices: 7

Now we will go through the edges one by one:

- Process edge (0, 2): Both have the same degree, so skip.
- Process edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 has fewer connections, check shared connections. Triangle found: <0, 2, 7>.
- Process edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has fewer connections, check shared connections. Triangle found: <0, 2, 8>.
- Process edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has fewer connections, check shared connections. Triangle found: <0, 2, 9>.
- Process edge (1, 2): Both have the same degree, so skip.
- Process edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 has fewer connections, check shared connections. Triangle found: <1, 2, 4>.
- Process edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 has fewer connections, check shared connections. Triangle found: <1, 3, 6>.
- Process edge (2, 0): Skip.
- Process edge (2, 1): Skip.
- Process edge (2, 7): Skip.
- Process edge (3, 6): Both have the same degree, so skip.
- Process edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 has fewer connections, check shared connections. Triangle found: <0, 3, 8>.
- Process edge (4, 1): Skip.
- Process edge (4, 7): Skip.
- Process edge (4, 8): Skip.
- Process edge (4, 9): Skip.
- Process edge (5, 6): Both have the same degree, so skip.
- Process edge (6, 1): Skip.
- Process edge (6, 3): Skip.
- Process edge (6, 5): Skip.
- Process edge (7, 0): Skip.
- Process edge (7, 2): Skip.
- Process edge (7, 4): Skip.
- Process edge (7, 9): Skip.
- Process edge (8, 0): Skip.
- Process edge (8, 3): Skip.
- Process edge (8, 4): Skip.
- Process edge (9, 0): Skip.
- Process edge (9, 4): Skip.
- Process edge (9, 7): Skip.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles found: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 4>.
