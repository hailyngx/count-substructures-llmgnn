Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as:

```
0---4---2
|\ /|  /
| 3 | 6
|/ \|/
5---9
|   |
7---8
```

Now, let's follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Sort the vertices by the number of connections (degree):
   - Vertex 3: degree 1
   - Vertex 6: degree 1
   - Vertex 7: degree 2
   - Vertex 8: degree 1
   - Vertex 5: degree 2
   - Vertex 9: degree 2
   - Vertex 2: degree 2
   - Vertex 1: degree 2
   - Vertex 0: degree 3
   - Vertex 4: degree 6

2. Relabel the vertices based on degree in increasing order:
   - Vertex 3 (degree 1) -> Vertex 0
   - Vertex 6 (degree 1) -> Vertex 1
   - Vertex 7 (degree 2) -> Vertex 2
   - Vertex 8 (degree 1) -> Vertex 3
   - Vertex 5 (degree 2) -> Vertex 4
   - Vertex 9 (degree 2) -> Vertex 5
   - Vertex 2 (degree 2) -> Vertex 6
   - Vertex 1 (degree 2) -> Vertex 7
   - Vertex 0 (degree 3) -> Vertex 8
   - Vertex 4 (degree 6) -> Vertex 9

3. Calculate the triangles:

- For edge (0, 4): Both 0 and 4 have fewer connections, and they share connections with 5 and 9, forming a triangle <0, 4, 5>.
- For edge (0, 5): Both 0 and 5 have fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (1, 6): Both 1 and 6 have fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (1, 9): Both 1 and 9 have fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (2, 4): Both 2 and 4 have fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (3, 4): Both 3 and 4 have fewer connections, and they share connection 2, forming a triangle <3, 4, 2>.
- For edge (4, 2): Both 4 and 2 have fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (4, 3): Both 4 and 3 have fewer connections, and they share connection 2, forming a triangle <4, 3, 2>.
- For edge (4, 6): Both 4 and 6 have fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (4, 7): Only 4 has fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (4, 8): Only 4 has fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (5, 0): Both 5 and 0 have fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (5, 9): Both 5 and 9 have fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (6, 1): Both 6 and 1 have fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (6, 4): Both 6 and 4 have fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (7, 4): Only 4 has fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (7, 8): Only 7 has fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (8, 7): Only 8 has fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (9, 1): Both 9 and 1 have fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.
- For edge (9, 5): Both 9 and 5 have fewer connections, but they do not share any connections.

From the above analysis, we find 2 unique triangles: <0, 4, 5> and <3, 4, 2>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
