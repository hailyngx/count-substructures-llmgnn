Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: 5 edges
- Node 2: 3 edges
- Node 3: 1 edge
- Node 4: 4 edges
- Node 5: 2 edges
- Node 7: 1 edge
- Node 8: 1 edge
- Node 9: 4 edges

Now we need to sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes in decreasing order of degrees: 0, 4, 9, 2, 5, 3, 8, 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting triangles. Since node 0 has the lowest degree, we will check its edges with nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.

- For edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 have a shared connection with Node 9 forming a triangle: <0, 2, 9>
- For edge (0, 3): No triangles formed.
- For edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 have a shared connection with Node 5 forming a triangle: <0, 4, 5>
- For edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
- For edge (0, 8): No triangles formed.

Moving on to the next node with the lowest degree, which is 4, we will check its edges with nodes 5 and 9.

- For edge (4, 5): Node 4 and Node 5 have a shared connection with Node 0 forming a triangle: <0, 4, 5>
- For edge (4, 9): Node 4 and Node 9 have a shared connection with Node 2 forming a triangle: <2, 4, 9>

After examining all relevant edges, we count a total of 3 triangles in the given graph: [3].
