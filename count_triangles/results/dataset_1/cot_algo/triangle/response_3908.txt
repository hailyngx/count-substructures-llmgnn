Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labels for the nodes are: 
Node 7 (Degree 1) 
Node 2 (Degree 1) 
Node 6 (Degree 2) 
Node 9 (Degree 2) 
Node 5 (Degree 3) 
Node 8 (Degree 3) 
Node 4 (Degree 4) 
Node 0 (Degree 5) 
Node 3 (Degree 5) 
Node 1 (Degree 5) 

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles: 

Triangles: 
[10] 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 3> <0, 1, 5> <0, 3, 4> <0, 3, 8> <0, 4, 8> <1, 3, 5> <1, 5, 9> <3, 4, 8> <4, 5, 9> <3, 7, 8>
