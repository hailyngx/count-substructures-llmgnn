Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

- Node 0 has 3 connections
- Node 1 has 3 connections
- Node 3 has 2 connections
- Node 5 has 2 connections
- Node 8 has 2 connections
- Node 9 has 2 connections
- Node 4 has 4 connections
- Node 6 has 4 connections
- Node 7 has 5 connections
- Node 2 has 6 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

- Node 0 will be relabeled as A
- Node 1 will be relabeled as B
- Node 3 will be relabeled as C
- Node 5 will be relabeled as D
- Node 8 will be relabeled as E
- Node 9 will be relabeled as F
- Node 4 will be relabeled as G
- Node 6 will be relabeled as H
- Node 7 will be relabeled as I
- Node 2 will be relabeled as J

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check for triangles:

- Edge (A, G) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (A, D) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (A, I) forms a triangle <0, 7, 1>.
- Edge (B, J) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (B, I) forms a triangle <1, 7, 0>.
- Edge (B, E) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (C, D) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (C, I) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (D, A) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (D, C) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (E, B) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (E, J) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (F, J) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (F, I) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (G, A) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (G, J) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (G, H) forms a triangle <4, 6, 2>.
- Edge (D, A) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (D, I) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (H, J) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (H, G) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (H, I) forms a triangle <6, 7, 2>.
- Edge (I, A) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (I, B) forms a triangle <7, 1, 0>.
- Edge (I, C) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (I, H) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (I, F) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (J, B) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (J, G) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (J, E) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (J, F) does not form a triangle.

After checking all edges, we have found two unique triangles: <0, 7, 1> and <4, 6, 2>.

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
