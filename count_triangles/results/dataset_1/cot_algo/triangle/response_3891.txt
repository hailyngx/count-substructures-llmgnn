Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each vertex:

- Vertex 0 has degree 3
- Vertex 1 has degree 3
- Vertex 2 has degree 4
- Vertex 3 has degree 3
- Vertex 4 has degree 4
- Vertex 6 has degree 2
- Vertex 7 has degree 4
- Vertex 8 has degree 2
- Vertex 9 has degree 2

Now we will relabel the vertices according to their degrees from least to most connections:

- Vertex 6 → 0
- Vertex 8 → 1
- Vertex 9 → 2
- Vertex 3 → 3
- Vertex 1 → 4
- Vertex 0 → 5
- Vertex 7 → 6
- Vertex 4 → 7
- Vertex 2 → 8

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 4, 7>

Count of triangles: [5]
