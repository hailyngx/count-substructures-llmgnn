Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in increasing order, we get the following new labels for the vertices: 

Vertex 9: 0 connections
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 6 connections
Vertex 0: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check each edge to count the number of triangles formed. 

Starting with edges involving Vertex 9:
- Vertex 9 (0 connections) has an edge with Vertex 0 (7 connections), proceed.
  We check for shared neighbors between Vertex 9 and Vertex 0: none.
- No triangles formed from edges with Vertex 9.

Moving on to edges involving Vertex 1:
- Vertex 1 (1 connection) has an edge with Vertex 7 (6 connections), proceed.
  We check for shared neighbors between Vertex 1 and Vertex 7: none.
- No triangles formed from edges with Vertex 1.

Continuing this process for the remaining edges:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7]. Unique triangles found include <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>.
