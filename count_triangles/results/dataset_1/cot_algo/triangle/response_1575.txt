Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the graph:

Node Degrees:
0: 3
1: 2
2: 1
3: 5
4: 2
5: 2
6: 2
7: 1
8: 1
9: 3

Sorted by degree:
2, 8, 7, 1, 4, 5, 6, 0, 9, 3

Triangles:
[8] <3, 1, 2>
[9] <3, 4, 9>
[10] <3, 5, 0>
[11] <4, 0, 5>
[12] <9, 6, 3>

Total number of triangles: [5]
