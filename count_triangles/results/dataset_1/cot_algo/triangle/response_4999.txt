Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 8, 2, 7, 3, 6, 1, 5, 4, 9, 0.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
1. (8, 0) - No triangles
2. (2, 6) - No triangles
3. (7, 3) - No triangles
4. (3, 4) - Triangle: <3, 4, 9>
5. (6, 7) - No triangles
6. (1, 4) - Triangle: <1, 4, 9>
7. (5, 6) - No triangles
8. (4, 3) - Triangle: <3, 4, 9>
9. (4, 9) - No triangles
10. (9, 7) - No triangles

The total number of triangles is [3] inside brackets. 
Unique triangles found are <3, 4, 9> and <1, 4, 9>.
