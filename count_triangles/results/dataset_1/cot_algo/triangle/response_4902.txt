Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices based on their degree. The sorted list of vertices is: 
```
1. 1 (degree 3)
2. 3 (degree 3)
3. 4 (degree 3)
4. 5 (degree 3)
5. 6 (degree 4)
6. 0 (degree 4)
7. 2 (degree 4)
8. 8 (degree 5)
9. 7 (degree 5)
10. 9 (degree 4)
```

Now, we will go through the edges using the ordered vertices and count the number of triangles formed. Remember, we only count a triangle if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex.

By looking at the shared connections, we find the following triangles: 
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <1, 2, 6>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <2, 6, 7>
6. <2, 6, 9>
7. <3, 4, 7>
8. <5, 7, 6>
9. <5, 7, 8>
10. <6, 7, 8>
11. <8, 7, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
