Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. The sorted list of vertices and the number of connections for each are as follows:
- Vertex 5: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 1 connection
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 5 connections
- Vertex 0: 5 connections

Next, we will go through each edge and check for shared connections to count triangles. Let's proceed based on the degree-based ordering:

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
