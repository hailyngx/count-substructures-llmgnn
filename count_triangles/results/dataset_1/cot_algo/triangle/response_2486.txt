Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labeling will be:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 6

By applying the degree-based ordering method, we will count the triangles by following the given edges. After counting, we find that there are:
\[ [27] \text{ triangles} \]

The unique triangles found are:
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 2>
- <0, 4, 1>
- <0, 6, 2>
- <1, 7, 5>
- <1, 7, 4>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <6, 9, 7>
- <8, 9, 6>
