Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to find the number of triangles in the graph.

The vertices sorted by their degree are:
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections (ties broken arbitrarily)
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections

Based on this ordering, we can now count the triangles in the graph.

Number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
