Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
0 (degree 2)  
1 (degree 3)  
4 (degree 3)  
5 (degree 2)  
8 (degree 1)  
3 (degree 3)  
7 (degree 5)  
6 (degree 6)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle <1, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
