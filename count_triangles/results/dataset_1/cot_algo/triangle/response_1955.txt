Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be:  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 1: 5 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 3: 3 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 5: 2 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 7: 6 connections  
Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 9: 2 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check each edge where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

Starting with the edges:
(0, 2) forms a triangle with 3  
(0, 3) does not form a triangle  
(0, 9) does not form a triangle  
(1, 5) forms a triangle with 4  
(1, 6) does not form a triangle  
(1, 7) does not form a triangle  
(1, 8) does not form a triangle  
(1, 9) forms a triangle with 9  
(2, 4) does not form a triangle  
(2, 6) does not form a triangle  
(2, 7) does not form a triangle  
(2, 8) does not form a triangle  
(3, 4) does not form a triangle  
(3, 7) does not form a triangle  
(4, 5) does not form a triangle  
(4, 7) forms a triangle with 2  
(5, 1) does not form a triangle  
(6, 7) does not form a triangle  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 3 and the unique triangles are: <0, 2, 3>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 9>.
