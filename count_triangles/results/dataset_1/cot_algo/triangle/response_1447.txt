Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 3 has 0 connections.
Nodes 1 and 7 have 1 connection.
Nodes 5 and 8 have 2 connections.
Nodes 2 and 6 have 3 connections.
Nodes 0 and 4 have 4 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.

Next, we need to relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 3 (0 connections) becomes Node 0.
Nodes 1 and 7 (1 connection) become Nodes 1 and 2 (in any order).
Nodes 5 and 8 (2 connections) become Nodes 3 and 4 (in any order).
Nodes 2 and 6 (3 connections) become Nodes 5 and 6 (in any order).
Nodes 0 and 4 (4 connections) become Nodes 7 and 8 (in any order).
Node 9 (5 connections) becomes Node 9.

After relabeling, the edges are as follows: (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7)

Now, we will count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles: <1, 4, 9> <1, 5, 9> <1, 3, 9> <1, 2, 5> <2, 4, 7> <3, 6, 9> <5, 6, 8>
