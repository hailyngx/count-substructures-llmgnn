Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0: 1, 5, 8
1: 0, 6, 7, 8
2: 3, 7
3: 2, 6
4: 7, 8, 9
5: 0, 6, 9
6: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
7: 1, 2, 4, 6
8: 0, 1, 4, 6
9: 4, 5
```

Now, we will sort the vertices based on the number of connections:

1. Vertex 2 has 2 connections.
2. Vertex 3 has 2 connections.
3. Vertex 9 has 2 connections.
4. Vertex 0 has 3 connections.
5. Vertex 5 has 3 connections.
6. Vertex 4 has 3 connections.
7. Vertex 7 has 4 connections.
8. Vertex 1 has 4 connections.
9. Vertex 8 has 4 connections.
10. Vertex 6 has 5 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

1. For edges (2, 3), no triangle is found.
2. For edges (2, 7), no triangle is found.
3. For edges (3, 6), no triangle is found.
4. For edges (4, 7), no triangle is found.
5. For edges (4, 8), no triangle is found.
6. For edges (4, 9), no triangle is found.
7. For edges (0, 1), no triangle is found.
8. For edges (0, 5), no triangle is found.
9. For edges (0, 8), triangle <0, 1, 8> is found.
10. For edges (1, 6), no triangle is found.
11. For edges (1, 7), triangle <1, 4, 7> is found.
12. For edges (1, 8), no triangle is found.
13. For edges (5, 6), triangle <5, 6, 1> is found.
14. For edges (5, 9), no triangle is found.
15. For edges (7, 2), no triangle is found.
16. For edges (7, 4), triangle <7, 1, 4> is found.
17. For edges (7, 6), triangle <7, 1, 6> is found.
18. For edges (8, 0), triangle <8, 0, 1> is found.
19. For edges (8, 4), triangle <8, 4, 1> is found.
20. For edges (8, 6), triangle <8, 6, 1> is found.
21. For edges (9, 4), no triangle is found.
22. For edges (9, 5), no triangle is found.

The total number of triangles is [7].
