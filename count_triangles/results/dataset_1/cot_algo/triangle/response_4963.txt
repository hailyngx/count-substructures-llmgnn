Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, we get the following order: 
Vertices: 2, 7, 8, 1, 6, 4, 9, 5, 3, 0

The edges that will be considered while counting triangles are: 
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 4), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 5), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)

Now, let's count the number of triangles.

[Total number of triangles: 10]

<0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 9>
