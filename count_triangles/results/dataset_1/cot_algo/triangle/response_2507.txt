Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps identify the number of triangles present in the graph. 
By sorting the nodes based on their degrees, we have the following labels for each node:
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 2

Next, we will identify the triangles formed by unique sets of vertices:

Triangles:
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
