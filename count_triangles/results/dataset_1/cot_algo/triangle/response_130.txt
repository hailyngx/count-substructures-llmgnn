Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order, we have:
Nodes: 0(3), 3(2), 5(2), 9(2), 2(2), 4(3), 6(3), 7(4), 8(4), 1(3)

Based on the sorted list, we will now count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 7): Check shared connections of node 0 and node 7. Shared connections: 5, 8. Triangle: <0, 5, 7>
2. Edge (0, 8): Check shared connections of node 0 and node 8. Shared connections: 3, 4, 9. Triangles: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 8, 9>
3. Edge (0, 9): Check shared connections of node 0 and node 9. Shared connections: 8. Triangle: <0, 8, 9>
4. Edge (1, 4): Check shared connections of node 1 and node 4. Shared connections: None
5. Edge (1, 5): Check shared connections of node 1 and node 5. Shared connections: 7. Triangle: <1, 5, 7>
6. Edge (1, 6): Check shared connections of node 1 and node 6. Shared connections: None
7. Edge (2, 6): Check shared connections of node 2 and node 6. Shared connections: None
8. Edge (3, 4): Check shared connections of node 3 and node 4. Shared connections: 8. Triangle: <3, 4, 8>
9. Edge (3, 8): Check shared connections of node 3 and node 8. Shared connections: None
10. Edge (4, 1): Already counted
11. Edge (4, 3): Already counted
12. Edge (4, 8): Already counted
13. Edge (5, 1): Already counted
14. Edge (5, 7): Already counted
15. Edge (6, 1): Already counted
16. Edge (6, 2): Check shared connections of node 6 and node 2. Shared connections: None
17. Edge (6, 7): Already counted
18. Edge (7, 0): Already counted
19. Edge (7, 5): Already counted
20. Edge (7, 6): Already counted
21. Edge (8, 0): Already counted
22. Edge (8, 3): Already counted
23. Edge (8, 4): Already counted
24. Edge (8, 9): Already counted
25. Edge (9, 0): Already counted
26. Edge (9, 8): Already counted

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 8>
