Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method. First, we need to sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 3: 0 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections

Next, we relabel the vertices:

Node 3: 0 connections → Node 0
Node 6: 0 connections → Node 1
Node 0: 2 connections → Node 2
Node 5: 2 connections → Node 3
Node 1: 2 connections → Node 4
Node 9: 2 connections → Node 5
Node 7: 2 connections → Node 6
Node 4: 2 connections → Node 7
Node 8: 4 connections → Node 8
Node 2: 4 connections → Node 9

Now, we will check each edge:

(0, 7): Node 2 and Node 7 share Node 4 → Triangle <2, 4, 7>
(1, 2): Node 4 and Node 9 do not share a connection
(1, 9): Node 4 and Node 5 share Node 8 → Triangle <4, 5, 9>
(2, 1): Node 4 and Node 5 do not share a connection
(2, 5): Node 4 and Node 3 do not share a connection
(2, 8): Node 4 and Node 8 share Node 5 → Triangle <4, 5, 8>
(4, 7): Node 7 and Node 4 share Node 2 → Triangle <2, 4, 7>
(4, 8): Node 7 and Node 8 do not share a connection
(5, 2): Node 3 and Node 4 do not share a connection
(6, 8): Node 1 and Node 8 do not share a connection
(7, 0): Node 6 and Node 2 share Node 4 → Triangle <2, 4, 6>
(7, 4): Node 6 and Node 2 share Node 0 → Triangle <0, 2, 6>
(8, 2): Node 5 and Node 4 do not share a connection
(8, 4): Node 5 and Node 7 do not share a connection
(8, 6): Node 5 and Node 1 do not share a connection
(8, 9): Node 5 and Node 5 do not share a connection
(9, 1): Node 5 and Node 4 share Node 8 → Triangle <4, 5, 9>
(9, 8): Node 5 and Node 8 do not share a connection

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <2, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, and <2, 4, 6>.
