Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Node 2 (degree 1)
Node 5 (degree 1)
Node 4 (degree 2)
Node 9 (degree 2)
Node 3 (degree 2)
Node 7 (degree 3)
Node 6 (degree 4)
Node 1 (degree 4)
Node 0 (degree 5)
Node 8 (degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

The triangles found are:
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 9, 0>
<1, 9, 4>
<3, 1, 4>
<3, 1, 9>
<5, 3, 8>
<5, 8, 6>
<5, 8, 7>
<7, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
