Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees and then relabeling them accordingly. 

The sorted vertices with their degrees are:
Vertex 0: Degree 2
Vertex 2: Degree 0
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 2
Vertex 8: Degree 2
Vertex 1: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 0

Based on the sorted order, we will inspect the edges in the following sequence: 
(0, 3), (0, 8), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (7, 1), (8, 5), (6, 7)

Counting the triangles:
Triangle <0, 3, 4>
Triangle <1, 4, 7>
Triangle <1, 4, 5>

Total triangles: [3]
