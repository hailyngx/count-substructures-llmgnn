Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes by the number of connections:
Node 7 (Degree: 2): Connected to nodes 6, 8
Node 4 (Degree: 3): Connected to nodes 3, 5, 6
Node 0 (Degree: 3): Connected to nodes 1, 3, 9
Node 5 (Degree: 3): Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4
Node 8 (Degree: 4): Connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 1 (Degree: 4): Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6
Node 2 (Degree: 4): Connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 9
Node 9 (Degree: 4): Connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 8
Node 6 (Degree: 6): Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 3 (Degree: 7): Connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8

Analyzing each edge with the lower labeled node having fewer connections:
Considering edge (0, 1): Forms triangle with node 3, <0, 1, 3>
Considering edge (0, 3): Forms triangle with nodes 1, 9, <0, 3, 9>
Considering edge (0, 9): Forms triangle with node 3, <0, 3, 9>
Considering edge (1, 2): Forms triangle with node 6, <1, 2, 6>
Considering edge (1, 5): Forms triangle with node 3, <1, 3, 5>
Considering edge (2, 3): Forms triangle with node 6, <2, 3, 6>
Considering edge (3, 4): Forms triangle with node 5, <3, 4, 5>
Considering edge (3, 5): Forms triangle with node 4, <3, 4, 5>
Considering edge (3, 6): Forms triangle with nodes 2, 4, <2, 3, 4> and nodes 4, 5, <3, 4, 5>
Considering edge (6, 7): Forms triangle with node 8, <6, 7, 8>
Considering edge (6, 8): Forms triangle with node 3, <3, 6, 8>
Considering edge (8, 9): Forms triangle with node 6, <8, 9, 6>

Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <8, 9, 6>
