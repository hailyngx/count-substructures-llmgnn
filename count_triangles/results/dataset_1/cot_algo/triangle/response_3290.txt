Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree: <8, 5, 7, 6, 2, 0, 9, 1, 4, 3>

We will now search for triangles:

Triangle 1: <4, 0, 1>
Triangle 2: <4, 1, 6>
Triangle 3: <4, 1, 7>
Triangle 4: <4, 9, 3>
Triangle 5: <1, 7, 4>
Triangle 6: <1, 5, 3>
Triangle 7: <7, 8, 4>

[Total number of triangles: 7]
