Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we have the following new labels for the nodes:
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 1
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 6
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 1
Node 9 has degree 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find:
- Triangle <1, 5, 6>
- Triangle <1, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
