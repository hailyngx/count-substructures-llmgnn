Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 0 - Degree 4  
Vertex 4 - Degree 2  
Vertex 2 - Degree 2  
Vertex 9 - Degree 2  
Vertex 1 - Degree 4  
Vertex 6 - Degree 4  
Vertex 7 - Degree 5  
Vertex 3 - Degree 4  
Vertex 5 - Degree 3  
Vertex 8 - Degree 3  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles:
