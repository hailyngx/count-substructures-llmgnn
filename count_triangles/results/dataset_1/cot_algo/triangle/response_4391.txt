Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections (degree):
Vertex 1 (degree 2)
Vertex 8 (degree 2)
Vertex 7 (degree 3)
Vertex 9 (degree 3)
Vertex 6 (degree 4)
Vertex 1 (degree 4)
Vertex 0 (degree 4)
Vertex 4 (degree 5)
Vertex 2 (degree 5)
Vertex 5 (degree 6)

Now, counting the triangles:
- (1, 8) forms a triangle with (5) as it shares connections with (1) and (8).
- (1, 8) forms another triangle with (4) as it shares connections with (1) and (8).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 8>.
