Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we obtain the following order: 1(2), 7(2), 9(2), 0(3), 4(3), 5(5), 3(6), 8(6), 6(8), 2(8).

Using the degree-based ordering, we will now count the number of triangles:

For edge (0, 6):
Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 6, so we form triangle <0, 6, adj. vertex>.
This contributes 8 triangles.

For edge (1, 2):
Vertex 1 has connections with vertex 2, but there are no triangles involving vertices 1 and 2.

For edge (1, 8):
Vertex 1 has connections with vertex 8, but there are no triangles involving vertices 1 and 8.

For edge (2, 1):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (2, 3):
Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 3, so we form triangle <2, 3, adj. vertex>.
This contributes 1 triangle.

For edge (2, 5):
Vertex 2 has connections with vertex 5, but there are no triangles involving vertices 2 and 5.

For edge (2, 6):
Vertex 2 has connections with vertex 6, so we form triangle <2, 6, adj. vertex>.
This contributes 1 triangle.

For edge (2, 7):
Vertex 2 has connections with vertex 7, but there are no triangles involving vertices 2 and 7.

For edge (3, 2):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (3, 5):
Vertex 3 has connections with vertex 5, so we form triangle <3, 5, adj. vertex>.
This contributes 1 triangle.

For edge (3, 6):
Vertex 3 has connections with vertex 6, but there are no triangles involving vertices 3 and 6.

For edge (3, 9):
Vertex 3 has connections with vertex 9, but there are no triangles involving vertices 3 and 9.

For edge (4, 5):
Vertex 4 has connections with vertex 5, but there are no triangles involving vertices 4 and 5.

For edge (4, 6):
Vertex 4 has connections with vertex 6, but there are no triangles involving vertices 4 and 6.

For edge (5, 2):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (5, 3):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (5, 4):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (5, 6):
Vertex 5 has connections with vertex 6, so we form triangle <5, 6, adj. vertex>.
This contributes 1 triangle.

For edge (6, 0):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (6, 2):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (6, 3):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (6, 4):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (6, 5):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (6, 8):
Vertex 6 has connections with vertex 8, so we form triangle <6, 8, adj. vertex>.
This contributes 1 triangle.

For edge (7, 2):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (7, 8):
Vertex 7 has connections with vertex 8, but there are no triangles involving vertices 7 and 8.

For edge (8, 1):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (8, 6):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (8, 7):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

For edge (9, 3):
No action is taken as per the degree-based ordering.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11], and the unique triangles found are <0, 6, adj. vertex>, <2, 3, adj. vertex>, <2, 6, adj. vertex>, <3, 5, adj. vertex>, and <6, 8, adj. vertex>.
