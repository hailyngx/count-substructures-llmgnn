Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
- Node 0 has 5 connections.
- Node 4 has 6 connections.
- Node 9 has 6 connections.
- Node 3 has 7 connections.
- Node 6 has 7 connections.
- Node 2 has 8 connections.
- Node 5 has 8 connections.
- Node 1 has 9 connections.
- Node 8 has 9 connections.
- Node 7 has 10 connections.

Following the process for counting triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 3>
