Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 2
- Node 3: Degree 1
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check the edges based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections.

Now, let's go through the edges to count the triangles:

1. (0, 6): No triangles can be formed.
2. (1, 2): No triangles can be formed.
3. (1, 3): No triangles can be formed.
4. (1, 7): Triangle <1, 4, 7> found.
5. (1, 8): Triangle <1, 4, 8> found.
6. (2, 1): No triangles can be formed (already counted).
7. (2, 4): No triangles can be formed.
8. (2, 9): No triangles can be formed.
9. (3, 1): No triangles can be formed (already counted).
10. (4, 2): No triangles can be formed (already counted).
11. (4, 7): No triangles can be formed.
12. (4, 8): No triangles can be formed (already counted).
13. (5, 6): No triangles can be formed.
14. (6, 0): No triangles can be formed.
15. (6, 5): No triangles can be formed.
16. (6, 7): Triangle <6, 7, 4> found.
17. (7, 1): No triangles can be formed (already counted).
18. (7, 4): No triangles can be formed (already counted).
19. (7, 6): Triangle <7, 4, 6> found.
20. (8, 1): No triangles can be formed (already counted).
21. (8, 4): No triangles can be formed (already counted).
22. (8, 9): No triangles can be formed.
23. (9, 2): No triangles can be formed.
24. (9, 8): No triangles can be formed.

The total number of triangles found in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, and <6, 7, 4>.
