Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 4, 6, 5, 2, 8, 3, 9, 1, 7, 0.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine the edges in the following order: 
(1, 4), (3, 6), (0, 7), (3, 7), (1, 8), (7, 8), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 5), (0, 2).

After checking these edges, we find the following triangles: 
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
