Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees and relabeling them accordingly, the new list of edges becomes:
(0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle <1, 2, 3>
- Triangle <1, 2, 8>
- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <1, 3, 8>
- Triangle <3, 4, 8>
- Triangle <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
