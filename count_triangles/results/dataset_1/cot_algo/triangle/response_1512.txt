Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most connections, the new labeling is: 
Node 0 (Degree 3) 
Node 1 (Degree 2) 
Node 5 (Degree 2) 
Node 4 (Degree 2) 
Node 8 (Degree 1) 
Node 7 (Degree 1) 
Node 6 (Degree 3) 
Node 9 (Degree 3) 
Node 2 (Degree 6) 
Node 3 (Degree 6) 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can find the triangles in the graph:

Triangles:
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <2, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
