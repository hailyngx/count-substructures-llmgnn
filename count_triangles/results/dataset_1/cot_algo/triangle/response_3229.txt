Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree of connections, the new labels are:
Node 2 - Degree: 1
Node 6 - Degree: 1
Node 9 - Degree: 2
Node 1 - Degree: 2
Node 8 - Degree: 2
Node 5 - Degree: 3
Node 4 - Degree: 4
Node 3 - Degree: 0
Node 0 - Degree: 5
Node 7 - Degree: 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [14]
