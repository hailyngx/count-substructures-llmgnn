Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 3 - Label 0
Node 0 - Label 1
Node 2 - Label 2
Node 6 - Label 3
Node 5 - Label 4
Node 8 - Label 5
Node 7 - Label 6
Node 1 - Label 7
Node 9 - Label 8
Node 4 - Label 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: 
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
