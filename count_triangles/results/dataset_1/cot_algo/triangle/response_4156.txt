Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 0(4), 1(1), 2(3), 3(1), 4(1), 5(2), 6(3), 7(2), 8(2), 9(1)

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 1(1), 3(1), 4(1), 9(1), 5(2), 7(2), 8(2), 2(3), 6(3), 0(4)

Following the rule to proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we start counting the triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>

Total number of triangles: [2]
