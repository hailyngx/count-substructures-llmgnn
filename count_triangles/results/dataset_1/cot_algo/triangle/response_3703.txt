Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees:

1. Vertex 2 - Degree 0
2. Vertex 6 - Degree 0
3. Vertex 8 - Degree 1
4. Vertex 1 - Degree 2
5. Vertex 4 - Degree 2
6. Vertex 5 - Degree 2
7. Vertex 9 - Degree 3
8. Vertex 3 - Degree 4
9. Vertex 7 - Degree 6
10. Vertex 0 - Degree 7

We will now count the triangles. Since the vertex with the lower label will have fewer connections, we will consider each edge starting from the vertex with the lower label. 

After analyzing the edges, we find that there are a total of 8 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

1. <0, 5, 9>
2. <1, 3, 7>
3. <1, 3, 4>
4. <3, 4, 7>
5. <5, 0, 9>
6. <7, 0, 1>
7. <7, 3, 4>
8. <9, 5, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
