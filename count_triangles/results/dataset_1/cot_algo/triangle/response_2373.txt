Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degrees:

Vertices arranged from least to most connections:
1. 7 (degree 2)
2. 5 (degree 2)
3. 1 (degree 2)
4. 4 (degree 2)
5. 2 (degree 3)
6. 9 (degree 4)
7. 8 (degree 4)
8. 3 (degree 5)
9. 6 (degree 5)
10. 0 (degree 6)

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 9, 8>
<2, 0, 3>
<2, 0, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 0, 9>
<3, 2, 0>
<3, 2, 8>
<4, 6, 0>
<6, 0, 1>
<6, 0, 4>
<9, 0, 3>
<9, 3, 8>

Total number of triangles: [15]
