Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labeling will be as follows:
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
-  Node 9: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
-  Node 1: degree 4
-  Node 8: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 0: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges, the triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, and <1, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
