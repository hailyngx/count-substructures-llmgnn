Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first apply the Degree-Based Ordering method by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
1. 5 (degree 1)
2. 9 (degree 1)
3. 7 (degree 1)
4. 3 (degree 2)
5. 6 (degree 2)
6. 1 (degree 3)
7. 4 (degree 3)
8. 2 (degree 4)

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
5 → 1
9 → 2
7 → 3
3 → 4
6 → 5
1 → 6
4 → 7
2 → 8

Next, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

(1, 2):
Since 1 (6) has degree 3 and 2 (8) has degree 4, we proceed. They have a shared connection to 4. 
Triangle: <1, 2, 4>

(1, 6):
Since 1 (6) has degree 3 and 6 (5) has degree 2, we proceed. They have a shared connection to 2. 
Triangle: <1, 6, 2>

(1, 7):
Since 1 (6) has degree 3 and 7 (3) has degree 1, we proceed. They do not form a triangle.

(2, 1):
Since 2 (8) has degree 4 and 1 (6) has degree 3, we proceed. They have a shared connection to 4. 
Triangle: <2, 1, 4>

(2, 3):
Since 2 (8) has degree 4 and 3 (4) has degree 2, we proceed. They do not form a triangle.

(2, 4):
Since 2 (8) has degree 4 and 4 (7) has degree 3, we proceed. They have a shared connection to 1. 
Triangle: <2, 4, 1>

(3, 2):
Since 3 (4) has degree 2 and 2 (8) has degree 4, we proceed. They do not form a triangle.

(3, 4):
Since 3 (4) has degree 2 and 4 (7) has degree 3, we proceed. They do not form a triangle.

(4, 2):
Since 4 (7) has degree 3 and 2 (8) has degree 4, we proceed. They have a shared connection to 1. 
Triangle: <4, 2, 1>

(4, 3):
Since 4 (7) has degree 3 and 3 (4) has degree 2, we proceed. They do not form a triangle.

(4, 9):
Since 4 (7) has degree 3 and 9 (2) has degree 1, we proceed. They do not form a triangle.

(5, 6):
Since 5 (1) has degree 1 and 6 (5) has degree 2, we proceed. They do not form a triangle.

(6, 1):
Since 6 (5) has degree 2 and 1 (6) has degree 3, we proceed. They have a shared connection to 2. 
Triangle: <6, 1, 2>

(6, 5):
Since 6 (5) has degree 2 and 5 (1) has degree 1, we proceed. They do not form a triangle.

(7, 1):
Since 7 (3) has degree 1 and 1 (6) has degree 3, we proceed. They do not form a triangle.

(9, 4):
Since 9 (2) has degree 1 and 4 (7) has degree 3, we proceed. They do not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 4>, <1, 6, 2>, <2, 4, 1>, <6, 1, 2>.
