Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, we get the following mapping: 
Node 1 (degree 2) - Connected to nodes 0, 6  
Node 0 (degree 4) - Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5  
Node 3 (degree 4) - Connected to nodes 0, 2, 8  
Node 4 (degree 5) - Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, 8  
Node 2 (degree 5) - Connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 8, 9  
Node 5 (degree 4) - Connected to nodes 0, 2, 4  
Node 9 (degree 2) - Connected to nodes 2, 6  
Node 8 (degree 4) - Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4  
Node 6 (degree 3) - Connected to nodes 1, 9  
Node 7 (degree 1) - Connected to node 4  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles:  
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>  
- Triangle <2, 4, 8>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
