Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we relabel them as follows:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 1: 6 connections
- Node 9: 8 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After analyzing all edges, the total number of triangles found in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
- <1, 0, 4>
- <1, 0, 9>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <6, 4, 9>
- <6, 3, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>
