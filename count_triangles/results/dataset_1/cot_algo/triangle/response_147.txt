Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:
Vertex 4 (Degree: 1)
Vertex 6 (Degree: 1)
Vertex 0 (Degree: 3)
Vertex 7 (Degree: 3)
Vertex 8 (Degree: 3)
Vertex 9 (Degree: 4)
Vertex 2 (Degree: 4)
Vertex 1 (Degree: 4)
Vertex 3 (Degree: 4)
Vertex 5 (Degree: 4)

Using the sorted vertices, we will count the triangles:
1. Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
2. Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle <0, 1, 3>.
3. Edge (0, 3) does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle <1, 9, 5>.
7. Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
8. Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle <2, 8, 0>.
9. Edge (2, 9) forms a triangle <2, 9, 1>.
10. Edge (3, 7) forms a triangle <3, 7, 5>.
11. Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
12. Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
13. Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle.
14. Edge (7, 5) forms a triangle <7, 5, 1>.
15. Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle.
16. Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.
17. Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.
18. Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle.
19. Edge (9, 5) forms a triangle <9, 5, 1>.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <1, 9, 5>, <2, 8, 0>, <2, 9, 1>, <3, 7, 5>
