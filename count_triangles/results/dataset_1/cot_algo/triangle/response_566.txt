Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

Vertices sorted by number of connections (degree):
0 (degree 2), 3 (degree 2), 4 (degree 2), 9 (degree 2), 5 (degree 4), 8 (degree 4), 6 (degree 5), 1 (degree 6), 7 (degree 6), 2 (degree 4)

Triangles found based on the method:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 7, 4>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 4>
<8, 9, 4>

Total number of triangles: [16]
