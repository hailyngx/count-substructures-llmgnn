Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: 5 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 5 connections
4: 5 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 5 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices from least to most connections:
2: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
0: 5 connections
3: 5 connections
4: 5 connections
9: 5 connections

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:

Triangles: [16]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 4, 9>, <6, 0, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <0, 3, 4>
