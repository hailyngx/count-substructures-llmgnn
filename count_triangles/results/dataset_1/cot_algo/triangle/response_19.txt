Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 7 connections
Vertex 7: 8 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

Number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
