Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

After relabeling the vertices, the new order is as follows: 
Vertex 0 has 2 connections
Vertex 2 has 2 connections
Vertex 7 has 2 connections
Vertex 8 has 2 connections
Vertex 4 has 0 connections
Vertex 1 has 3 connections
Vertex 3 has 4 connections
Vertex 5 has 5 connections
Vertex 9 has 5 connections
Vertex 6 has 5 connections

Now, we will check each edge by considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Let's count the triangles formed by these connections:
- Triangle <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
