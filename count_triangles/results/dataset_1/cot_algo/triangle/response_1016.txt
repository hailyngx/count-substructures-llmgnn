Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree. The degrees of the nodes in this graph are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5

Now, renumber the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 2 (degree 1) is relabeled as 0
- Node 5 (degree 2) is relabeled as 1
- Node 3 (degree 3) is relabeled as 2
- Node 0 (degree 4) is relabeled as 3
- Node 1 (degree 4) is relabeled as 4
- Node 4 (degree 4) is relabeled as 5
- Node 7 (degree 4) is relabeled as 6
- Node 8 (degree 4) is relabeled as 7
- Node 6 (degree 5) is relabeled as 8
- Node 9 (degree 5) is relabeled as 9

After relabeling, the edges can be rewritten as follows:
(2, 9) (5, 8) (0, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <3, 4, 6>
- Triangle 3: <6, 7, 8>
- Triangle 4: <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
