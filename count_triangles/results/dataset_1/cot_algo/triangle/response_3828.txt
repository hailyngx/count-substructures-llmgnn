Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are as follows:
Nodes with degree 1: 3, 5, 6
Nodes with degree 2: 1
Nodes with degree 3: 4
Nodes with degree 4: 0, 9
Nodes with degree 5: 7
Nodes with degree 6: 8
Nodes with degree 7: 2

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
[9]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
