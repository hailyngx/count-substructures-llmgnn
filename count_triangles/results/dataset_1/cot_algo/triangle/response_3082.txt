Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 - Degree 2
Node 1 - Degree 3
Node 3 - Degree 2
Node 5 - Degree 2
Node 8 - Degree 3
Node 7 - Degree 4
Node 6 - Degree 4
Node 9 - Degree 4
Node 2 - Degree 5
Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 
Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 9>
