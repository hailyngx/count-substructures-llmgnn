Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles on this graph is as follows:

Nodes sorted by degree: 
Node 4 (degree 0) 
Node 9 (degree 2) 
Node 0 (degree 2) 
Node 2 (degree 2) 
Node 6 (degree 2) 
Node 8 (degree 2) 
Node 7 (degree 3) 
Node 1 (degree 4) 
Node 5 (degree 5) 
Node 3 (degree 5) 

Based on the sorting, we will start counting triangles:
