Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows: 

Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 6 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Vertex 2 (2 connections) and Vertex 4 (5 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

2. Vertex 2 (2 connections) and Vertex 8 (2 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

3. Vertex 7 (3 connections) and Vertex 0 (5 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

4. Vertex 7 (3 connections) and Vertex 6 (4 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

5. Vertex 6 (4 connections) and Vertex 1 (4 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

6. Vertex 6 (4 connections) and Vertex 4 (5 connections):
   - Triangle formed: <4, 6, 9>.

7. Vertex 6 (4 connections) and Vertex 3 (5 connections):
   - Triangle formed: <3, 6, 9>.

8. Vertex 1 (4 connections) and Vertex 3 (5 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

9. Vertex 1 (4 connections) and Vertex 0 (5 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

10. Vertex 4 (5 connections) and Vertex 5 (6 connections):
   - Triangle formed: <4, 5, 9>.

11. Vertex 4 (5 connections) and Vertex 9 (6 connections):
   - Triangle formed: <4, 6, 9> (already counted).

12. Vertex 3 (5 connections) and Vertex 0 (5 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

13. Vertex 3 (5 connections) and Vertex 5 (6 connections):
   - Triangle formed: <3, 5, 6>.

14. Vertex 0 (5 connections) and Vertex 5 (6 connections):
   - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 7>.

15. Vertex 0 (5 connections) and Vertex 9 (6 connections):
   - Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>.

16. Vertex 5 (6 connections) and Vertex 9 (6 connections):
   - Triangle formed: <5, 6, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [4]
