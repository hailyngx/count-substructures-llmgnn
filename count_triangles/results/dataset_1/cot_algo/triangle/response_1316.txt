Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each node:
- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Next, we sort the nodes based on the number of connections:
1. Node 1, Node 2, Node 6 (2 connections)
2. Node 7, Node 8, Node 3 (3 connections)
3. Node 4, Node 5, Node 9 (4 connections)
4. Node 0 (5 connections)

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Based on the sorted list, we will go through each edge.
- Count triangles only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex.

By following the steps above, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
