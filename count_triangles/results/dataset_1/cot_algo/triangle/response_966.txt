Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

After relabeling the vertices, the graph becomes:
Vertices: [9, 1, 8, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7, 5, 0]
Edges: (9, 0) (1, 0) (8, 0) (4, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (7, 3) (6, 2) (7, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 5) (5, 0) (8, 1) (2, 7) (4, 3)

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

1. For the edge (9, 0):
   - No triangles are formed.

2. For the edge (1, 0):
   - No triangles are formed.

3. For the edge (8, 0):
   - No triangles are formed.

4. For the edge (4, 0):
   - No triangles are formed.

5. For the edge (3, 1):
   - No triangles are formed.

6. For the edge (3, 4):
   - No triangles are formed.

7. For the edge (7, 3):
   - No triangles are formed.

8. For the edge (6, 2):
   - No triangles are formed.

9. For the edge (7, 2):
   - Triangle <2, 5, 7> is formed.

10. For the edge (5, 2):
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5> is formed.
   - Triangle <2, 3, 5> is formed.

11. For the edge (5, 3):
   - No triangles are formed.

12. For the edge (7, 5):
   - No triangles are formed.

13. For the edge (5, 0):
   - No triangles are formed.

14. For the edge (8, 1):
   - No triangles are formed.

15. For the edge (2, 7):
   - No triangles are formed.

16. For the edge (4, 3):
   - No triangles are formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles: <2, 5, 7>, <0, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 5>
