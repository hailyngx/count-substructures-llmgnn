Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree in ascending order, the new labeling is: 
(1) - 1 connection
(3) - 2 connections
(7) - 3 connections
(6) - 4 connections
(0) - 5 connections
(2) - 5 connections
(8) - 5 connections
(9) - 5 connections
(4) - 6 connections
(5) - 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find that there are [12] triangles in this graph. 
Unique triangles found: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
