Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  
Node 1 has 1 connection.  
Node 6 has 2 connections.  
Node 2 has 2 connections.  
Node 4 has 2 connections.  
Node 5 has 3 connections.  
Node 8 has 3 connections.  
Node 9 has 3 connections.  
Node 0 has 4 connections.  
Node 7 has 4 connections.  
Node 3 has 6 connections.  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph.

Triangles:
1. <0, 7, 3>
2. <0, 7, 4>
3. <0, 9, 2>
4. <0, 9, 5>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <2, 3, 8>
7. <3, 4, 7>
8. <3, 7, 4>

Total number of triangles: [8]
