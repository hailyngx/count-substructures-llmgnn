Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertices: 7, 4, 5, 9, 0, 6, 1, 8, 3, 2

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:
Triangles: [7]

Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>
