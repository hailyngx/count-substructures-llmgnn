Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles can be done as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections:
- Vertex 9: degree 1
- Vertex 3: degree 1
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 5
- Vertex 0: degree 5

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Vertex 9 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 3 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 6 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 1 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 5 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 2 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 8 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 7 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 4 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 0 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 9

3. Count the triangles:
- Triangles: [<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>]

4. Output:
The total number of triangles is [2].
