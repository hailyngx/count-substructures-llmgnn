Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 6 has 0 connections
Node 9 has 1 connections
Node 7 has 2 connections
Node 1 has 2 connections
Node 8 has 2 connections
Node 0 has 3 connections
Node 5 has 3 connections
Node 4 has 3 connections
Node 2 has 4 connections
Node 3 has 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges, we find the following triangles:
[<0, 2, 5> <0, 3, 4> <0, 4, 8> <0, 4, 3> <0, 5, 2> <0, 5, 3> <0, 5, 4> <1, 3, 7> <1, 9, 2> <3, 4, 8> <3, 4, 0> <3, 4, 5> <3, 5, 0> <3, 5, 2> <3, 5, 4> <4, 8, 3> <5, 0, 2> <5, 0, 3> <5, 2, 0> <5, 2, 3> <5, 3, 0> <5, 3, 2>]
Total number of triangles: [21]
