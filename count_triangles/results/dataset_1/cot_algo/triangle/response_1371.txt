Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 3: 0 connection
Node 5: 0 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will count the triangles:
- Node 3 and Node 5 cannot form triangles as they have 0 connections.
- Node 0 cannot form triangles as it has only 2 connections.
- Node 6 and Node 8 cannot form triangles as they have 2 connections.
- Node 1 and Node 5 cannot form triangles as they have 3 connections.
- Node 4 and Node 7 can form a triangle with Node 1 via edge (1, 4): This forms the triangle <1, 4, 7>.
- Node 9 can form triangles with Node 4 and Node 7 via edges (4, 9) and (9, 7) respectively: This forms the triangles <4, 7, 9> and <4, 7, 9>.
- Node 8 can form a triangle with Node 2 via edge (2, 8): This forms the triangle <2, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
