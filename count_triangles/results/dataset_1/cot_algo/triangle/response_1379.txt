Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Vertex} & \text{Degree} \\
\hline
0 & 2 \\
1 & 2 \\
3 & 1 \\
4 & 1 \\
5 & 1 \\
6 & 1 \\
7 & 4 \\
8 & 4 \\
9 & 4 \\
2 & 4 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on the sorted order:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Original Label} & \text{New Label} \\
\hline
0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 \\
3 & 2 \\
4 & 3 \\
5 & 4 \\
6 & 5 \\
7 & 6 \\
8 & 7 \\
9 & 8 \\
2 & 9 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Now, we will count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (0, 5): No triangle
- Edge (0, 8): No triangle
- Edge (1, 7): No triangle
- Edge (1, 9): No triangle
- Edge (2, 7): No triangle
- Edge (2, 8): No triangle
- Edge (2, 9): No triangle
- Edge (3, 6): No triangle
- Edge (4, 8): No triangle

Now, let's consider the remaining edges based on the new labels: 
- Edge (5, 0) forms a triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle
- Edge (7, 1) does not form a triangle
- Edge (7, 2) forms a triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Edge (7, 9) forms a triangle <1, 6, 8>
- Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, and <1, 6, 8>.
