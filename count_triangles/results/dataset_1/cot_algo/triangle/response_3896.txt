Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them, we get the following graph:
Nodes: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, 2
Edges: (0, 1), (4, 6), (5, 2), (7, 3), (8, 2), (1, 0), (6, 4), (2, 5), (3, 7), (6, 9), (1, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (3, 1), (8, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (9, 6), (7, 2), (9, 2), (6, 3), (3, 6), (8, 2), (7, 2), (2, 6)

With this ordering, we can count the number of triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 6]
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
