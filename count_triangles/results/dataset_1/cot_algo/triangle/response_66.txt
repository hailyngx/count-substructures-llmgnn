Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles and the unique triangles are:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>
