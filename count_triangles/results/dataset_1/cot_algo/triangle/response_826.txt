Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for each vertex are: 
Vertex 0 has 2 connections, label = 0 
Vertex 3 has 2 connections, label = 1 
Vertices 5 and 9 have 2 connections, label = 2 
Vertices 8 and 4 have 3 connections, label = 3 
Vertices 6 and 2 have 4 connections, label = 4 
Vertices 7 and 1 have 5 connections, label = 5 

Using these labels, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is: [6]

The unique triangles found are: <1, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 5>.
