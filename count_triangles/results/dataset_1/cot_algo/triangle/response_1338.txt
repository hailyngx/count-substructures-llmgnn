Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices can be labeled as follows based on their number of connections (degree):

Node 0: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 1

Based on the labeling, we will only consider the following edges:
(0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7)

Now, we will count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge:

1. Triangle: <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangle: <0, 3, 7>
3. Triangle: <1, 4, 5>
4. Triangle: <3, 5, 6>
5. Triangle: <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
