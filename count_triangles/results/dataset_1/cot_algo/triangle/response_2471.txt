Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method first sorts the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted order of the vertices and their respective connections are as follows:

Nodes: 3(2), 6(3), 5(4), 1(4), 9(5), 7(5), 4(5), 8(6), 2(6), 0(7)

Now, we will count the triangles based on this ordering:

1. Node 3 (2 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed involving node 3.

2. Node 6 (3 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed involving node 6.

3. Node 5 (4 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed involving node 5.

4. Node 1 (4 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed involving node 1.

5. Node 9 (5 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed involving node 9.

6. Node 7 (5 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed involving node 7.

7. Node 4 (5 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed involving node 4.

8. Node 8 (6 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed involving node 8.

9. Node 2 (6 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed involving node 2.
   
10. Node 0 (7 connections):
   - <0, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
