Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new numbering of the nodes is as follows:
Node 0 has 0 connections.
Node 7 has 1 connection.
Nodes 1, 8, and 9 have 2 connections.
Nodes 2 and 6 have 3 connections.
Nodes 3 and 5 have 4 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles based on shared connections:

1. Triangle <3, 5, 6>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <1, 8, 5>
5. Triangle <1, 9, 4>
6. Triangle <0, 4, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
