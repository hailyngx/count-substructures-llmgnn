Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  
Vertex 1: 1 connection  
Vertex 7: 2 connections  
Vertex 5: 4 connections  
Vertex 4: 4 connections  
Vertex 6: 4 connections  
Vertex 3: 4 connections  
Vertex 9: 4 connections  
Vertex 2: 5 connections  
Vertex 8: 6 connections  
Vertex 0: 6 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles.  

[Total number of triangles: 3]  

The unique triangles are:  
<0, 2, 8>  
<0, 2, 9>  
<0, 5, 8>
