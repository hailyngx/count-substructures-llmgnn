Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. Here is the sorted list of vertices:

Vertices: 
1. 1 (degree: 1)
2. 7 (degree: 1)
3. 0 (degree: 3)
4. 8 (degree: 2)
5. 4 (degree: 3)
6. 9 (degree: 3)
7. 5 (degree: 3)
8. 6 (degree: 3)
9. 3 (degree: 4)
10. 2 (degree: 5)

Now, we will iterate through the edges starting from the edge with the vertex having the lower label. Count the number of triangles formed by each edge:

1. Edge (0, 2): Shared connections: 3, 5
2. Edge (0, 3): Shared connections: None
3. Edge (0, 5): Shared connections: None
4. Edge (1, 2): Shared connections: None
5. Edge (2, 4): Shared connections: None
6. Edge (2, 6): Shared connections: 3, 5
7. Edge (2, 8): Shared connections: None
8. Edge (3, 4): Shared connections: None
9. Edge (3, 5): Shared connections: None
10. Edge (3, 6): Shared connections: None
11. Edge (3, 7): Shared connections: None
12. Edge (4, 9): Shared connections: None
13. Edge (5, 9): Shared connections: None
14. Edge (6, 9): Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 2, 5>
