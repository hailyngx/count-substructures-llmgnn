Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degrees of each vertex in the graph:

- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 2: degree = 1
- Node 3: degree = 5
- Node 4: degree = 1
- Node 5: degree = 1
- Node 6: degree = 1
- Node 7: degree = 3
- Node 9: degree = 5

Now, we will sort the nodes by their degrees in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

- Node 2: degree = 1 -> New label = 0
- Node 4: degree = 1 -> New label = 1
- Node 5: degree = 1 -> New label = 2
- Node 6: degree = 1 -> New label = 3
- Node 0: degree = 3 -> New label = 4
- Node 7: degree = 3 -> New label = 5
- Node 3: degree = 5 -> New label = 6
- Node 9: degree = 5 -> New label = 7

Now, we will list the edges in their new format:

(4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the shared connections:
- Node 4: <4, 6, 7>
- Node 6: <6, 4, 7>
- Node 7: <7, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
