Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are as follows:
Node 1 (Degree 2) connected to: 3, 5
Node 7 (Degree 2) connected to: 4, 8
Node 6 (Degree 3) connected to: 5, 3, 8
Node 9 (Degree 3) connected to: 0, 2, 3
Node 4 (Degree 4) connected to: 0, 2, 3, 8
Node 5 (Degree 4) connected to: 2, 3, 6, 8
Node 0 (Degree 5) connected to: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 3 (Degree 6) connected to: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 8 (Degree 6) connected to: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Node 2 (Degree 7) connected to: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4> (shared connection: 4)
- Triangle <0, 2, 8> (shared connection: 8)
- Triangle <0, 2, 9> (shared connection: 2)
- Triangle <0, 4, 8> (shared connection: 0)
- Triangle <2, 4, 8> (shared connection: 2)

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
