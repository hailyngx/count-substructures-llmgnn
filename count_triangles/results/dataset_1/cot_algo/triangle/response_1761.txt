Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
