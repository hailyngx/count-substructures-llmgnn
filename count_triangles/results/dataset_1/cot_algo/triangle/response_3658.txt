Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Reordering the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes in increasing order of degree: 7, 6, 1, 9, 0, 8, 5, 4, 3, 2

The edges based on the reordering are: (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 8) (4, 7) (4, 5) (8, 9) (3, 2) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (8, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (8, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (7, 4)

Now, let's count the triangles:
Triangles: [11]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 0>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 8, 0>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 5, 0>, <8, 9, 0>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 8>
