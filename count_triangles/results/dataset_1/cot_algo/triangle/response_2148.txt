Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

0: 3 connections
1: 1 connection
2: 2 connections
3: 5 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 1 connection
6: 4 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 6 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:

1: 1 connection (node 5)
2: 2 connections (node 1)
7: 2 connections (node 2)
0: 3 connections (node 0)
4: 4 connections (node 4)
6: 4 connections (node 3)
8: 4 connections (node 8)
3: 5 connections (node 6)
9: 6 connections (node 9)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

Triangles: [<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 9, 2>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 4>, <3, 9, 4>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 3>, <6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 2>, <6, 9, 3>, <6, 9, 4>, <8, 4, 9>, <9, 0, 2>, <9, 2, 3>, <9, 2, 6>, <9, 3, 4>, <9, 3, 6>, <9, 4, 8>, <9, 4, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [30].
