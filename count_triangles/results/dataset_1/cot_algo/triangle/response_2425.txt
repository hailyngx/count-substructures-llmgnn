Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 ⟶ Degree 2
Node 1 ⟶ Degree 4
Node 2 ⟶ Degree 2
Node 3 ⟶ Degree 4
Node 4 ⟶ Degree 5
Node 5 ⟶ Degree 3
Node 6 ⟶ Degree 5
Node 7 ⟶ Degree 7
Node 8 ⟶ Degree 2
Node 9 ⟶ Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles and list them uniquely:

[Total number of triangles: 16]

<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 4>
