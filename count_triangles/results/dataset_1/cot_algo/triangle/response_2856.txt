Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 3: degree 0
- Node 7: degree 0
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle <0, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
