Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertex 0: 3 connections 
Vertex 1: 3 connections 
Vertex 2: 2 connections 
Vertex 3: 5 connections 
Vertex 4: 4 connections 
Vertex 5: 1 connection 
Vertex 6: 4 connections 
Vertex 7: 1 connection 
Vertex 8: 2 connections 
Vertex 9: 1 connection 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now go through each edge to count the number of triangles.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 5>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 0>
