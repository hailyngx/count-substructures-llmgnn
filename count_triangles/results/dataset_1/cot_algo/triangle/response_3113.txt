Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. The degrees of the vertices in this graph are as follows:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 5 connections
- Vertex 2: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 3 connections

Based on the degrees, we can re-label the vertices in the following order:
- Vertex 0 (degree 2)
- Vertex 5 (degree 2)
- Vertex 8 (degree 2)
- Vertex 4 (degree 1)
- Vertex 2 (degree 3)
- Vertex 9 (degree 3)
- Vertex 7 (degree 3)
- Vertex 3 (degree 4)
- Vertex 6 (degree 4)
- Vertex 1 (degree 5)

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Triangle <1, 0, 9> (shared connection: 1)
- Triangle <1, 5, 9> (shared connection: 1)
- Triangle <1, 6, 7> (shared connection: 1)
- Triangle <1, 3, 6> (shared connection: 1)
- Triangle <1, 3, 4> (shared connection: 3)
- Triangle <3, 6, 7> (shared connection: 3)
- Triangle <3, 8, 2> (shared connection: 3)
- Triangle <6, 7, 2> (shared connection: 7)

Finally, we count the total number of triangles: [8].
