Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degrees from least to most:
Vertices: 1(0), 2(1), 3(4), 4(1), 5(2), 6(3), 7(1), 8(1), 9(2)

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degrees:
Vertices: 1(0), 2(1), 3(2), 4(3), 5(4), 6(5), 7(6), 8(7), 9(8)

Now, we will list the unique triangles found:
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 9>

Finally, we will count the total number of triangles: [5]
