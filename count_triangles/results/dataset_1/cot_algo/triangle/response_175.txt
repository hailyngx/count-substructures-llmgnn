Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections

Therefore, the degree-based ordering is: 1, 7, 0, 8, 3, 4, 2, 9, 5.

Now, we will count the triangles:

- (1, 2): No triangles
- (1, 7): No triangles
- (1, 0): No triangles
- (1, 8): No triangles
- (1, 3): No triangles
- (1, 4): No triangles
- (1, 2): No triangles
- (1, 9): No triangles
- (1, 5): No triangles
- (7, 0): No triangles
- (7, 8): No triangles
- (7, 3): No triangles
- (7, 4): No triangles
- (7, 2): No triangles
- (7, 9): No triangles
- (7, 5): No triangles
- (0, 8): No triangles
- (0, 3): No triangles
- (0, 4): No triangles
- (0, 2): No triangles
- (0, 9): Found triangle: <0, 3, 9>
- (0, 5): No triangles
- (8, 3): No triangles
- (8, 4): No triangles
- (8, 2): No triangles
- (8, 9): No triangles
- (8, 5): No triangles
- (3, 4): No triangles
- (3, 2): No triangles
- (3, 9): No triangles
- (3, 5): No triangles
- (4, 2): No triangles
- (4, 9): No triangles
- (4, 5): No triangles
- (2, 9): Found triangle: <2, 0, 9>
- (2, 5): Found triangle: <2, 3, 5>
- (9, 5): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 9>, <2, 0, 9>, <2, 3, 5>.
