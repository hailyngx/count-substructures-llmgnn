Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the order becomes: 1 (degree 0), 0 (degree 3), 4 (degree 2), 7 (degree 2), 9 (degree 2), 5 (degree 4), 6 (degree 3), 8 (degree 5), 2 (degree 8), 3 (degree 5).

After processing each edge based on the degree-based ordering, we find that there are a total of 9 triangles. 

The triangles found are: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
