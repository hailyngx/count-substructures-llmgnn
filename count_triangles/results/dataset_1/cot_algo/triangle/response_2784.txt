Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 1 has degree 3
- Vertex 2 has degree 2
- Vertex 3 has degree 2
- Vertex 4 has degree 5
- Vertex 5 has degree 4
- Vertex 6 has degree 2
- Vertex 7 has degree 1
- Vertex 8 has degree 5
- Vertex 9 has degree 4

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 7 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 0 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 2 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 3 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 6 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 5 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 9 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 1 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 8 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 4 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 9

Now, we will list the edges with the lower labeled vertex first:
(0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 9) (8, 9)

Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections between the two vertices of each edge reveals the following triangles:
<1, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
