Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, from least to most.

The sorted vertices are:
Vertex  = Connections
1 (1)  = 1
3 (2)  = 1
0 (0)  = 4
2 (3)  = 4
6 (6)  = 2
7 (8)  = 2
9 (9)  = 3
5 (5)  = 4
8 (7)  = 4
4 (4)  = 5

Next, we will count the triangles by examining each edge:

(0, 1): No triangle
(0, 4): <0, 1, 4>
(0, 5): <0, 4, 5>
(0, 7): No triangle
(1, 4): No triangle
(1, 5): <1, 0, 5>
(2, 3): No triangle
(2, 4): <2, 1, 4>
(2, 6): No triangle
(3, 2): No triangle
(4, 0): No triangle
(4, 1): No triangle
(4, 2): No triangle
(4, 5): <4, 0, 5>
(4, 8): No triangle
(5, 0): No triangle
(5, 1): No triangle
(5, 4): No triangle
(5, 8): <5, 0, 8>
(6, 2): No triangle
(6, 9): No triangle
(7, 0): No triangle
(7, 9): No triangle
(8, 4): No triangle
(8, 5): No triangle
(8, 9): No triangle
(9, 6): No triangle
(9, 7): No triangle
(9, 8): No triangle

The total number of triangles is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 0, 5>, and <5, 0, 8>.
