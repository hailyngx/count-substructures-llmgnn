Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labeling is:
Vertices: 8, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6, 0, 9, 2, 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles and list them as follows:
[Total number of triangles: 4]
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
