Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree):
Vertices: 4, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 6, 3, 7, 0

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly: 
4 -> 0
1 -> 1
2 -> 2
5 -> 3
8 -> 4
9 -> 5
6 -> 6
3 -> 7
7 -> 8
0 -> 9

Now, we will list the edges that satisfy the condition: the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(1,7) --> forms a triangle with 5 and 9
(3,0) --> forms a triangle with 6 and 8
(5,7) --> forms a triangle with 0 and 6

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3], and the unique triangles found are <1, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 8>.
