Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices:  
0 - degree 2  
1 - degree 2  
3 - degree 1  
7 - degree 1  
5 - degree 0  
9 - degree 0  
6 - degree 3  
8 - degree 3  
2 - degree 4  
4 - degree 4  

Since vertices with lower labels have fewer connections, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 2), (4, 2), (6, 1), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 6)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by each edge:

(0, 1): No triangles formed.

(1, 6): No triangles formed.

(2, 0): No triangles formed.

(3, 2): No triangles formed.

(4, 2): Triangle <2, 4, 8> formed.

(6, 1): Triangle <1, 6, 8> formed.

(7, 4): No triangles formed.

(8, 4): Triangle <4, 6, 8> formed.

(8, 6): Triangle <4, 6, 8> formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, and <4, 6, 8>.
