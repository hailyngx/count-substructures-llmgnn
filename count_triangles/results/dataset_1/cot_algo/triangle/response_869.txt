Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2

Now, let's relabel the vertices according to their degrees:
- Node 5 (degree 1) becomes node 0
- Nodes 1, 3, 8, 9 (degree 2) become nodes 1, 2, 3, 4
- Nodes 0, 4, 7 (degree 3) become nodes 5, 6, 7
- Node 6 (degree 4) remains node 8
- Node 2 (degree 5) becomes node 9

Now, we will examine the edges based on the relabeled vertices:
- (0, 1) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 1, 5>
- (0, 2) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 2, 5>
- (0, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 7, 5>
- (1, 2) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <1, 2, 5>
- (2, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <2, 5, 9>
- (2, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 8: <2, 6, 8>
- (2, 6) also forms a triangle with vertex 7: <2, 6, 7>
- (2, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <2, 6, 9>
- (3, 4) does not form a triangle due to the degree-based ordering
- (4, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 8: <4, 9, 8>
- (6, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 8: <6, 9, 8>
- (7, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <7, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
