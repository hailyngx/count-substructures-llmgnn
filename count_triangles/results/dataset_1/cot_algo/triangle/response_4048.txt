Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 2 edges
Node 3: 2 edges
Node 4: 2 edges
Node 8: 1 edge
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 6: 3 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 7: 5 edges
Node 2: 5 edges
Node 9: 6 edges

Now, we will relabel the nodes in ascending order based on their degrees:

Node 8 (1 edge) -> Node 0
Node 3 (2 edges) -> Node 1
Node 4 (2 edges) -> Node 2
Node 0 (2 edges) -> Node 3
Node 5 (3 edges) -> Node 4
Node 6 (3 edges) -> Node 5
Node 1 (4 edges) -> Node 6
Node 2 (5 edges) -> Node 7
Node 7 (5 edges) -> Node 8
Node 9 (6 edges) -> Node 9

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and examining the edges:
(0, 1) shares a connection with (1, 5) forming a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
(2, 7) shares a connection with (7, 9) forming a triangle <2, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
