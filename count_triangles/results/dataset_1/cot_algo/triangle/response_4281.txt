Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new order is: 3, 1, 5, 6, 4, 7, 0, 9, 2, 8. 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
