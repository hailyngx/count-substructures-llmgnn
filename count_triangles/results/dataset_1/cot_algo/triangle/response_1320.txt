Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles in the given graph:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Sorted nodes based on connections:
0, 7, 2, 5, 4, 6, 3, 1, 8, 9

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Triangles:
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 1, 9>
<3, 1, 4>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
