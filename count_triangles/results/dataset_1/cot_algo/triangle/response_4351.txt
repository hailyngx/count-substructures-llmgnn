Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the provided graph is as follows:

Sorted vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 5
- Vertex 0: degree 6
- Vertex 4: degree 6
- Vertex 8: degree 7

Now, we will list the edges for each vertex in ascending order of degrees:
Edges for Vertex 7: (7, 8) (7, 9)
Edges for Vertex 2: (2, 6) (2, 8)
Edges for Vertex 5: (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9)
Edges for Vertex 1: (1, 4) (1, 8)
Edges for Vertex 6: (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5)
Edges for Vertex 9: (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7)
Edges for Vertex 3: (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9)
Edges for Vertex 0: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9)
Edges for Vertex 4: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8)
Edges for Vertex 8: (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7)

Now, we will count the triangles by looking at shared connections between vertices of each edge:
[Total number of triangles: 6]
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 1>
<7, 8, 9>
