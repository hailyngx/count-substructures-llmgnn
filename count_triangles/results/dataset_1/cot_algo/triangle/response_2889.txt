Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertices: 2, 8, 9, 1, 3, 6, 5, 7, 0, 4

The edges to consider are:
(2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 9), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 9), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Calculating the triangles formed by these edges:
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 9, 4>
<8, 3, 9>
<8, 9, 4>
<9, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
