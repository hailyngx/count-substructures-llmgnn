Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new ordering is: <3, 4, 6, 9, 0, 1, 5, 7, 2, 8>.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles, we can identify the following triangles:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
