Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following labels:  
Node 6: 2 connections  
Nodes 2, 3, 9: 3 connections  
Nodes 1, 7: 4 connections  
Nodes 0, 5, 8: 5 connections  
Nodes 4: 6 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and examining each edge, we find the triangles listed below:  
Triangles:  
<0, 1, 5>  
<0, 5, 4>  
<0, 5, 7>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<0, 8, 7>  

Total number of triangles: [5]
