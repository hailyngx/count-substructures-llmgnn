Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering will be as follows:
1. Node 0 - Degree: 1
2. Node 6 - Degree: 2
3. Node 7 - Degree: 2
4. Node 9 - Degree: 1
5. Node 2 - Degree: 2
6. Node 5 - Degree: 3
7. Node 4 - Degree: 5
8. Node 1 - Degree: 5
9. Node 8 - Degree: 6
10. Node 3 - Degree: 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following:
Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 8>
