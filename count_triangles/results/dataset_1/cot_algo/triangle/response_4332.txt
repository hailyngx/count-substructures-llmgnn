Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, the new order of nodes is as follows:
Nodes: 5, 9, 0, 2, 6, 8, 3, 7, 4, 1

By checking each edge with the node of lower label that has fewer connections, we find the following triangles: 
<2, 1, 0>
<3, 7, 1>
<7, 4, 1>
<7, 3, 2>
<1, 9, 6>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
