Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 1 (1 connection), 3 (1 connection), 8 (1 connection), 5 (2 connections), 7 (2 connections), 0 (4 connections), 4 (4 connections), 6 (4 connections), 2 (5 connections), 9 (6 connections).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

For vertex 0 (4 connections):
- Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 9.
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with shared connections 9 and 8.
- Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 5.

For vertex 1 (1 connection):
No triangles can be formed.

For vertex 2 (5 connections):
No triangles can be formed.

For vertex 3 (1 connection):
No triangles can be formed.

For vertex 4 (4 connections):
- Edge (4, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 9.
- Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle with shared connections 0 and 3.

For vertex 5 (2 connections):
No triangles can be formed.

For vertex 6 (4 connections):
- Edge (5, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 0.

For vertex 8 (1 connection):
No triangles can be formed.

For vertex 9 (6 connections):
- Edge (9, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 6.
- Edge (9, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 4.
- Edge (9, 4) forms a triangle with shared connections 0 and 8.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 5>, <4, 8, 9>, <9, 3, 4>, <5, 6, 0>, <9, 5, 6>, <9, 0, 4>.
