Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have the following relabeling:
Vertex 0 has 3 connections
Vertex 1 has 4 connections
Vertex 2 has 2 connections
Vertex 3 has 2 connections
Vertex 4 has 2 connections
Vertex 5 has 2 connections
Vertex 6 has 1 connection
Vertex 7 has 5 connections
Vertex 8 has 4 connections
Vertex 9 has 2 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can find the triangles:

- For edge (0, 1): vertices 0 and 1 share a connection with vertex 3, forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- For edge (0, 2): no triangle is formed.
- For edge (0, 3): no triangle is formed.
- For edge (1, 0): this is a duplicate edge.
- For edge (1, 4): no triangle is formed.
- For edge (1, 8): no triangle is formed.
- For edge (2, 0): this is a duplicate edge.
- For edge (2, 7): vertices 2 and 7 share a connection with vertex 4, forming a triangle <2, 7, 4>.
- For edge (3, 0): this is a duplicate edge.
- For edge (3, 5): vertices 3 and 5 share a connection with vertex 8, forming a triangle <3, 5, 8>.
- For edge (4, 1): this is a duplicate edge.
- For edge (4, 7): vertices 4 and 7 share a connection with vertex 1, forming a triangle <4, 7, 1>.
- For edge (5, 3): this is a duplicate edge.
- For edge (5, 8): vertices 5 and 8 share a connection with vertex 1, forming a triangle <5, 8, 1>.
- For edge (6, 7): no triangle is formed.
- For edge (7, 2): this is a duplicate edge.
- For edge (7, 4): this is a duplicate edge.
- For edge (7, 6): no triangle is formed.
- For edge (7, 8): vertices 7 and 8 share a connection with vertex 1, forming a triangle <7, 8, 1>.
- For edge (7, 9): no triangle is formed.
- For edge (8, 1): this is a duplicate edge.
- For edge (8, 5): this is a duplicate edge.
- For edge (8, 7): this is a duplicate edge.
- For edge (8, 9): vertices 8 and 9 share a connection with vertex 7, forming a triangle <8, 9, 7>.
- For edge (9, 7): this is a duplicate edge.
- For edge (9, 8): this is a duplicate edge.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <2, 7, 4>, <3, 5, 8>, and <4, 7, 1>.
