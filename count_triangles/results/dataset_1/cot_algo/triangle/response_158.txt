Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degrees in increasing order:

Nodes: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5, 6, 7, 1

Now, renumber the vertices accordingly:

Node 2 -> 1
Node 3 -> 2
Node 4 -> 3
Node 8 -> 4
Node 9 -> 5
Node 5 -> 6
Node 6 -> 7
Node 7 -> 8
Node 1 -> 9

Next, we will count the triangles. We will iterate through each edge and only consider cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
1. <1, 5, 6>
2. <1, 6, 7>
3. <1, 5, 7>
4. <6, 4, 7>
5. <7, 2, 4>
6. <6, 5, 1>
7. <7, 1, 5>

Total number of triangles: [7]
