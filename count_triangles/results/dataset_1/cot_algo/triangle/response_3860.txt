Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly.

The list of vertices with their degrees:
(0: 3), (1: 3), (2: 3), (3: 6), (4: 4), (5: 3), (6: 3), (7: 4), (8: 3), (9: 3)

Vertices sorted by degree:
(4, 7), (3, 9), (0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8)

Now, we will count the triangles by considering the edges in the sorted order:

1. For vertex 4:
Edges: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 7)
Triangles: <2, 3, 4>

2. For vertex 7:
Edges: (7, 4), (7, 6)
Triangles: <4, 6, 7>

3. For vertex 3:
Edges: (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9)
Triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 7, 9>

4. For vertex 9:
Edges: (9, 3), (9, 8)
Triangle: <3, 8, 9>

5. For vertex 0:
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 8)
Triangles: <0, 3, 7>

6. For vertex 1:
Edges: (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8)
Triangles: <1, 5, 7>

2 unique triangles are found: <0, 2, 3> and <4, 6, 7>.

The total number of triangles is [2].
