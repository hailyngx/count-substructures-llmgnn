Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices in ascending order is as follows:
Node 0: degree 1
Node 5: degree 1
Node 6: degree 1
Node 8: degree 1
Node 4: degree 2
Node 9: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 7: degree 6
Node 3: degree 6

Now, let's count the number of triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Starting with the edge (0, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (1, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (1, 7): Triangle <1, 7, 9> is formed.
- Moving to the edge (2, 3): Triangle <2, 3, 4> is formed.
- Moving to the edge (2, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (3, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (3, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (3, 7): Triangle <3, 7, 9> is formed.
- Moving to the edge (3, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (4, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (4, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (5, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (5, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (6, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (7, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (7, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (7, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (7, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (8, 0): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (9, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (9, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (9, 7): No triangles can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2], and the unique triangles are <1, 7, 9> and <2, 3, 4>.
