Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections:
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections

Based on the connections, we process the edges from least connected vertices to most connected vertices when it involves a pair of vertices.

Triangles found:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is:
