Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

- Node 0 has 2 connections.
- Node 1 has 2 connections.
- Node 2 has 1 connection.
- Node 3 has 4 connections.
- Node 4 has 0 connections.
- Node 5 has 5 connections.
- Node 6 has 2 connections.
- Node 7 has 2 connections.
- Node 8 has 3 connections.
- Node 9 has 6 connections.

Based on the degree-based ordering, we can relabel the nodes as follows:
Node 4 (degree 0) -> Node A
Node 2 (degree 1) -> Node B
Node 0 (degree 2) -> Node C
Node 1 (degree 2) -> Node D
Node 6 (degree 2) -> Node E
Node 7 (degree 2) -> Node F
Node 8 (degree 3) -> Node G
Node 3 (degree 4) -> Node H
Node 5 (degree 5) -> Node I
Node 9 (degree 6) -> Node J

Now, we can analyze the edges following the rules mentioned earlier to count the number of triangles.

Triangles:
<D, J, E>
<J, I, F>
<J, H, G>
<J, I, E>
<J, F, G>

Total number of triangles: [5]
