Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- Looking at the edge (0, 1): Node 0 and Node 1 have a shared connection at Node 6, forming a triangle <0, 1, 6>.
- Looking at the edge (0, 6): Node 0 and Node 6 have a shared connection at Node 5, forming a triangle <0, 6, 5>.
- Looking at the edge (1, 3): Node 1 and Node 3 have a shared connection at Node 4, forming a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
- Looking at the edge (2, 4): No triangle formed.
- Looking at the edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.
- Looking at the edge (3, 4): No triangle formed.
- Looking at the edge (3, 5): No triangle formed.
- Looking at the edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
- Looking at the edge (4, 2): No triangle formed.
- Looking at the edge (5, 2): No triangle formed.
- Looking at the edge (5, 6): Node 5 and Node 6 have a shared connection at Node 0, forming a triangle <5, 6, 0>.
- Looking at the edge (6, 0): No triangle formed.
- Looking at the edge (6, 5): No triangle formed.
- Looking at the edge (6, 7): No triangle formed.
- Looking at the edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
