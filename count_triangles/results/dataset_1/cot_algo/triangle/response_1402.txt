Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0 has 4 connections
Vertex 1 has 3 connections
Vertex 7 has 1 connection
Vertex 4 has 2 connections
Vertex 6 has 2 connections
Vertex 8 has 2 connections
Vertex 3 has 3 connections
Vertex 2 has 2 connections
Vertex 5 has 3 connections
Vertex 9 has 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 7]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
