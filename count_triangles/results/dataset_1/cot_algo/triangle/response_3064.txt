Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their connections from least to most:

0 (degree 3), 1 (degree 0), 2 (degree 2), 3 (degree 4), 4 (degree 4), 5 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 7 (degree 4), 8 (degree 1), 9 (degree 1)

After relabelling the vertices, the graph can be represented as:
Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Edges: (2, 5), (2, 7), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (7, 9), (8, 9)

Calculating the number of triangles:
For edge (2, 5):
    - Shared connections with 2: []
    - Shared connections with 5: []
    - No triangle formed

For edge (2, 7):
    - Shared connections with 2: []
    - Shared connections with 7: []
    - No triangle formed

For edge (0, 3):
    - Shared connections with 0: [4, 5]
    - Shared connections with 3: [6, 7]
    - Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 7>

For edge (0, 4):
    - Shared connections with 0: [3, 5, 6]
    - Shared connections with 4: [6, 7]
    - Triangle formed: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 5, 7>

For edge (0, 5):
    - Shared connections with 0: [3, 4]
    - Shared connections with 5: [6]
    - Triangle formed: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>

For edge (3, 6):
    - Shared connections with 3: [0, 7]
    - Shared connections with 6: [4, 5]
    - Triangle formed: <3, 0, 4>, <3, 0, 5>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 7, 5>

For edge (3, 7):
    - Shared connections with 3: [0, 6]
    - Shared connections with 7: [4]
    - Triangle formed: <3, 0, 4>, <3, 6, 4>

For edge (4, 6):
    - Shared connections with 4: [0, 7]
    - Shared connections with 6: [3, 5]
    - Triangle formed: <4, 0, 3>, <4, 0, 5>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 7, 5>

For edge (4, 7):
    - Shared connections with 4: [0, 6]
    - Shared connections with 7: [3]
    - Triangle formed: <4, 0, 3>, <4, 6, 3>

For edge (5, 6):
    - Shared connections with 5: [0]
    - Shared connections with 6: [3, 4]
    - Triangle formed: <5, 0, 3>, <5, 0, 4>

For edge (7, 9):
    - Shared connections with 7: []
    - Shared connections with 9: []
    - No triangle formed

For edge (8, 9):
    - Shared connections with 8: []
    - Shared connections with 9: []
    - No triangle formed

Total number of triangles: [16]
