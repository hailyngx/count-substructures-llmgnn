Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree in increasing order:
- Node 0 -> Label 2
- Node 1 -> Label 2
- Node 2 -> Label 2
- Node 3 -> Label 2
- Node 4 -> Label 3
- Node 5 -> Label 4
- Node 6 -> Label 2
- Node 7 -> Label 3
- Node 8 -> Label 2
- Node 9 -> Label 4

Next, we will list the edges according to the labels:
- (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (7, 9)

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 5 and 8: Triangle <4, 5, 8>
- Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7: Triangles <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <6, 5, 7>

Finally, we output the total number of triangles inside brackets:
[6]
