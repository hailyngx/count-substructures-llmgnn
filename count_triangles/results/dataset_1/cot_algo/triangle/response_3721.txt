Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method entails sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices along with the number of connections each vertex has is as follows:
- Node 9: 1 connection
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 0: 7 connections

Now, we proceed to count the triangles:

Triangles involving Node 0:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 6, 3>

Triangles involving Node 1:
- None (need to skip since Node 1 has 2 connections)

Triangles involving Node 7:
- <7, 2, 4>

Triangles involving Node 4:
- None (need to skip since Node 4 has 3 connections)

Triangles involving Node 8:
- None (need to skip since Node 8 has 3 connections)

Triangles involving Node 5:
- None (need to skip since Node 5 has 4 connections)

Triangles involving Node 6:
- None (need to skip since Node 6 has 4 connections)

Triangles involving Node 3:
- None (need to skip since Node 3 has 4 connections)

Triangles involving Node 2:
- None (need to skip since Node 2 has 5 connections)

Total number of triangles: [6]
        
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 6.
