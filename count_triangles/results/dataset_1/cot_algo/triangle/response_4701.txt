Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After relabeling the nodes based on their degree, the graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 1(1), 3(2), 2(3), 7(4), 5(5), 8(6), 4(7), 9(8), 6(9), 0(10)

The edges are as follows:
(10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 1)
(1, 5) (1, 9)
(3, 6) (3, 8)
(2, 6) (2, 8)
(7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8)
(5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 10)
(8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2)
(4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6)
(9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 10)
(6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 10)

Based on this representation, the total number of triangles is [1].
The unique triangles found are: <5, 7, 10>.
