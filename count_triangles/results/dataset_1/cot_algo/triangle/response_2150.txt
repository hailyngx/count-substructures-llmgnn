Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are: 3, 0, 2, 1, 9, 4, 6, 5, 8, 7.

Now we can analyze the edges based on the new labels:

1. (0, 1): Shared connections for vertices 0 and 1 are 7. 
2. (0, 7): Shared connections for vertices 0 and 7 are already counted in edge (0, 1).
3. (1, 0): This edge is already considered with edge (0, 1).
4. (1, 7): Shared connections for vertices 1 and 7 are already counted in edge (0, 1).
5. (1, 8): Shared connections for vertices 1 and 8 are 6. This forms a triangle <1, 6, 8>.
6. (3, 9): Shared connections for vertices 3 and 9 are 6. This forms a triangle <3, 6, 9>.
7. (6, 8): Shared connections for vertices 6 and 8 are already counted in edge (1, 8).
8. (6, 9): Shared connections for vertices 6 and 9 are already counted in edge (3, 9).
9. (7, 0): Shared connections for vertices 7 and 0 are already counted in edge (0, 1).
10. (7, 1): Shared connections for vertices 7 and 1 are already counted in edge (0, 1).
11. (8, 1): This edge is already considered with edge (1, 8).
12. (8, 6): Shared connections for vertices 8 and 6 are already counted in edge (1, 8).
13. (9, 3): Shared connections for vertices 9 and 3 are already counted in edge (3, 9).
14. (9, 6): Shared connections for vertices 9 and 6 are already counted in edge (3, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <1, 6, 8> and <3, 6, 9>.
