Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will re-label the nodes based on their degree. The nodes will be sorted from least connected to most connected as follows:
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 4: 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Then, we will count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge.

After calculating, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<4, 8, 7>
<1, 9, 4>
<1, 2, 4>
