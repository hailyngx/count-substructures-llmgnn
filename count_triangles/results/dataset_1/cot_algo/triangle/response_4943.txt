Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices in order of their degrees:  

0: 3 connections  
3: 2 connections  
5: 0 connections  
9: 2 connections  
7: 4 connections  
4: 3 connections  
6: 4 connections  
8: 2 connections  
1: 5 connections  
2: 4 connections  

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:  

5: 0 connections  
3: 1 connections  
8: 2 connections  
9: 3 connections  
2: 4 connections  
6: 5 connections  
4: 6 connections  
0: 7 connections  
7: 8 connections  
1: 9 connections  

Now, we will check the edges based on the labels:  
- Edge (0, 1) is skipped since 0 has more connections than 1.  
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle: <0, 7, 9>  
- Edge (0, 9) is skipped since 0 has more connections than 9.  
- Edge (1, 0) is skipped since 1 has more connections than 0.  
- Edge (1, 2) is skipped since 1 has more connections than 2.  
- Edge (1, 4) is skipped since 1 has more connections than 4.  
- Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle: <1, 6, 2>  
- Edge (1, 8) is skipped since 1 has more connections than 8.  
- Edge (2, 1) is skipped since 2 has more connections than 1.  
- Edge (2, 3) is skipped since 2 has more connections than 3.  
- Edge (2, 6) forms a triangle: <2, 6, 1>  
- Edge (2, 7) is skipped since 2 has more connections than 7.  
- Edge (3, 2) is skipped since 3 has more connections than 2.  
- Edge (3, 4) is skipped since 3 has more connections than 4.  
- Edge (4, 1) is skipped since 4 has more connections than 1.  
- Edge (4, 3) is skipped since 4 has more connections than 3.  
- Edge (4, 9) is skipped since 4 has more connections than 9.  
- Edge (6, 1) is skipped since 6 has more connections than 1.  
- Edge (6, 2) forms a triangle: <6, 2, 7>  
- Edge (6, 7) forms a triangle: <6, 7, 0>  
- Edge (6, 8) is skipped since 6 has more connections than 8.  
- Edge (7, 0) is skipped since 7 has more connections than 0.  
- Edge (7, 2) is skipped since 7 has more connections than 2.  
- Edge (7, 6) is skipped since 7 has more connections than 6.  
- Edge (8, 1) is skipped since 8 has more connections than 1.  
- Edge (8, 6) forms a triangle: <8, 6, 2>  
- Edge (9, 0) is skipped since 9 has more connections than 0.  
- Edge (9, 4) is skipped since 9 has more connections than 4.  

Total number of triangles: [4]
