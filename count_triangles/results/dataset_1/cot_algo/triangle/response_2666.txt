Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, we have the following mapping: 
Nodes: 5, 2, 9, 1, 3, 7, 6, 4, 8, 0

Now, counting the triangles formed:
- Node 5 (degree 1) has no triangles.
- Node 2 (degree 2) has no triangles.
- Node 9 (degree 2) has no triangles. 
- Node 1 (degree 2) has no triangles.
- Node 3 (degree 3) has no triangles.
- Node 7 (degree 4) has no triangles.
- Node 6 (degree 4) forms the following triangles: <0, 4, 6> and <0, 6, 8>.
- Node 4 (degree 5) forms the following triangles: <0, 4, 6> and <0, 4, 7> and <4, 6, 7>.
- Node 8 (degree 6) forms the following triangles: <0, 6, 8> and <0, 8, 9> and <6, 8, 9>.
- Node 0 (degree 7) forms the following triangles: <0, 4, 6> and <0, 4, 7> and <0, 6, 8> and <0, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, and <6, 8, 9>.
