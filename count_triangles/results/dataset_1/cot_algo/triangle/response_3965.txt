Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting vertices by the number of connections:

Vertices: 
0 -> 1 connection 
3 -> 1 connection 
4 -> 1 connection 
1 -> 0 connection 
10 -> 0 connection 
2 -> 4 connections 
6 -> 4 connections 
8 -> 2 connections 
5 -> 3 connections 
9 -> 3 connections 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- (0, 2): No triangle formed
- (2, 0): No triangle formed
- (2, 5): No triangle formed
- (2, 6): Triangle formed with 5: <2, 5, 6>
- (3, 8): No triangle formed
- (4, 7): No triangle formed
- (5, 2): No triangle formed
- (5, 6): Triangle formed with 2: <2, 5, 6>
- (5, 9): No triangle formed
- (6, 2): No triangle formed
- (6, 5): No triangle formed
- (6, 8): No triangle formed
- (7, 4): No triangle formed
- (7, 9): No triangle formed
- (8, 3): No triangle formed
- (8, 6): Triangle formed with 5: <2, 6, 8>
- (9, 5): No triangle formed
- (9, 7): No triangle formed

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 8>
