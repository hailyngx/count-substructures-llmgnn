Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 9, 1, 7, 6, 5, 0, 4, 8, 3, 2

Now, we will count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [5]
