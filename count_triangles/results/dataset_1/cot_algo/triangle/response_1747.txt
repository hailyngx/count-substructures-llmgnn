Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices can be sorted based on their degree as follows:  

0 (degree 4)  
1 (degree 3)  
2 (degree 3)  
3 (degree 2)  
4 (degree 3)  
5 (degree 2)  
6 (degree 3)  
7 (degree 1)  
8 (degree 2)  
9 (degree 4)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can consider the edges in the following order:

(3, 8) does not form a triangle.  
(3, 9) does not form a triangle.  
(5, 4) does not form a triangle.  
(8, 7) does not form a triangle.  
(8, 3) does not form a triangle.  
(9, 4) does not form a triangle.  
(9, 6) forms a triangle <4, 6, 9>.  
(0, 1) does not form a triangle.  
(0, 2) does not form a triangle.  
(0, 5) does not form a triangle.  
(0, 6) does not form a triangle.  
(1, 0) does not form a triangle.  
(1, 2) does not form a triangle.  
(1, 6) does not form a triangle.  
(2, 0) does not form a triangle.  
(2, 1) does not form a triangle.  
(2, 4) does not form a triangle.  
(4, 2) does not form a triangle.  
(4, 5) does not form a triangle.  
(6, 0) does not form a triangle.  
(6, 1) does not form a triangle.  
(6, 9) forms a triangle <0, 6, 9>.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
