Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices: 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2

Sorting: 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices for easier reference:
0 -> 2
1 -> 7
2 -> 3
3 -> 4
4 -> 8
6 -> 5
7 -> 6
8 -> 9
9 -> 10

Next, we will look at each edge while considering the lower labeled vertex with fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 1): Check vertices 2 and 7, common connection with vertex 9, form triangle <2, 7, 9>.
- Edge (0, 3): Check vertices 2 and 4, no triangles.
- Edge (0, 6): Check vertices 2 and 5, no triangles.
- Edge (0, 7): Check vertices 2 and 6, no triangles.
- Edge (0, 9): Check vertices 2 and 10, no triangles.
- Edge (1, 0): Skip since vertex 2 has more connections.
- Edge (1, 2): Check vertices 7 and 3, form triangle <7, 3, 4>.
- Edge (1, 9): Check vertices 7 and 10, no triangles.
- Edge (2, 1): Skip since vertex 7 has more connections.
- Edge (2, 4): Skip since vertex 4 has more connections.
- Edge (3, 0): Skip since vertex 4 has more connections.
- Edge (3, 7): Check vertices 4 and 6, no triangles.
- Edge (4, 2): Skip since vertex 3 has more connections.
- Edge (6, 0): Skip since vertex 5 has more connections.
- Edge (6, 8): Check vertices 5 and 9, no triangles.
- Edge (7, 0): Skip since vertex 6 has more connections.
- Edge (7, 3): Skip since vertex 6 has more connections.
- Edge (7, 8): Check vertices 6 and 9, form triangle <6, 8, 9>.
- Edge (8, 6): Skip since vertex 9 has more connections.
- Edge (8, 7): Skip since vertex 9 has more connections.
- Edge (9, 0): Skip since vertex 10 has more connections.
- Edge (9, 1): Skip since vertex 10 has more connections.

There are 2 unique triangles found: <2, 7, 9> and <6, 8, 9>. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
