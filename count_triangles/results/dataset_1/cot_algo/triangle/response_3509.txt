Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be as follows:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles by analyzing the edges in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 has 1 connection, Node 1 has 5 connections. Since Node 0 has fewer connections, we proceed to check for shared connections. Node 0 and Node 1 share an edge with Node 4, forming a triangle <0, 1, 4>.  
2. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 has 5 connections, Node 2 has 4 connections. We do not proceed due to degree-based ordering.
3. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 has 5 connections, Node 4 has 4 connections. Proceeding, we find that Node 1, Node 4, and Node 2 form a triangle <1, 4, 2>.
4. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 has 5 connections, Node 9 has 2 connections. Proceeding, we find that Node 1, Node 9, and Node 8 form a triangle <1, 9, 8>.
5. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 has 4 connections, Node 4 has 4 connections. Proceeding, we find that Node 2, Node 4, and Node 6 form a triangle <2, 4, 6>.
6. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 has 4 connections, Node 8 has 4 connections. Proceeding, we find that Node 3, Node 8, and Node 6 form a triangle <3, 8, 6>.
7. Edge (6, 8): Node 6 has 4 connections, Node 8 has 4 connections. Proceeding, we find that Node 6, Node 8, and Node 3 form a triangle <6, 8, 3>.
8. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 has 4 connections, Node 9 has 2 connections. Proceeding, we find that Node 8, Node 9, and Node 1 form a triangle <8, 9, 1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
