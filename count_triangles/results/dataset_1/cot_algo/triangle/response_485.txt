Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 2 - Degree 2  
Node 5 - Degree 1  
Node 1 - Degree 2  
Node 8 - Degree 3  
Node 0 - Degree 5  
Node 6 - Degree 4  
Node 4 - Degree 4   
Node 7 - Degree 5   
Node 9 - Degree 5  
Node 3 - Degree 5  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Counting the triangles using this method, we find the total number of triangles to be [6].
The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
