Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees, then relabeling them accordingly. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
(0: 2), (4: 1), (7: 2), (3: 2), (5: 3), (9: 2), (1: 4), (8: 4) 

Following the method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (0, 4): Both 0 and 4 have fewer connections.
- (0, 7): Both 0 and 7 have fewer connections.
- (5, 7): 5 has fewer connections than 7.
- (3, 5): 3 has fewer connections than 5.
- (0, 7): Both 0 and 7 have fewer connections.
- (5, 7): 5 has fewer connections than 7.
- (3, 5): 3 has fewer connections than 5.

Counting the triangles formed by these edges, we find the following unique triangle: <0, 5, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
