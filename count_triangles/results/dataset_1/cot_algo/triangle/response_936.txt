Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of vertices:
Vertices: 6, 1, 2, 8, 9, 4, 0, 7, 3, 5

Now, we will iterate through each edge in the graph and only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will then find any shared connections between the two vertices of the edge to identify triangles.

Calculating the number of triangles:

Edge (0, 5): Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle {0, 5, 8}
Edge (0, 8): Skipped since both vertices have the same degree
Edge (0, 9): Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle {0, 5, 9}
Edge (1, 3): No triangle
Edge (1, 4): No triangle
Edge (2, 3): No triangle
Edge (2, 5): Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle {2, 5, 7}
Edge (3, 1): No triangle
Edge (3, 2): No triangle
Edge (3, 7): No triangle
Edge (3, 9): Shared connection with vertex 9 forms a triangle {3, 5, 9}
Edge (4, 1): No triangle
Edge (4, 5): Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle {4, 5, 7}
Edge (4, 7): No triangle
Edge (5, 0): Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle {0, 5, 8}
Edge (5, 2): Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle {2, 5, 7}
Edge (5, 4): Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle {4, 5, 7}
Edge (5, 7): Shared connection with vertex 7 forms a triangle {2, 5, 7}
Edge (5, 8): Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle {0, 5, 8}
Edge (5, 9): Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle {0, 5, 9}
Edge (6, 7): No triangle
Edge (7, 3): No triangle
Edge (7, 4): No triangle
Edge (7, 5): Shared connection with vertex 7 forms a triangle {2, 5, 7}
Edge (7, 6): No triangle
Edge (7, 8): Shared connection with vertex 7 forms a triangle {0, 5, 8}
Edge (8, 0): Shared connection with vertex 8 forms a triangle {0, 5, 8}
Edge (8, 5): Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle {0, 5, 8}
Edge (8, 7): Shared connection with vertex 7 forms a triangle {0, 5, 8}
Edge (9, 0): Shared connection with vertex 9 forms a triangle {0, 5, 9}
Edge (9, 3): Shared connection with vertex 9 forms a triangle {3, 5, 9}
Edge (9, 4): No triangle
Edge (9, 5): Shared connection with vertex 9 forms a triangle {0, 5, 9}

Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>
