Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 1
- Vertex 2: degree 1
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 4

Now, we will label the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 1: label 0
- Vertex 2: label 1
- Vertex 3: label 1
- Vertex 6: label 2
- Vertex 7: label 3
- Vertex 0: label 4
- Vertex 8: label 4
- Vertex 4: label 5
- Vertex 9: label 5
- Vertex 5: label 5

Now, we will check each edge with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0(label 4) has 3 connections, Vertex 4(label 5) has 4 connections -> Proceed
- Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0(label 4) has 3 connections, Vertex 6(label 2) has 2 connections -> Proceed
- Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0(label 4) has 3 connections, Vertex 8(label 4) has 3 connections -> Proceed
- Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1(label 0) has 1 connection, Vertex 5(label 5) has 4 connections -> Proceed
- Edge (2, 9): Vertex 2(label 1) has 1 connection, Vertex 9(label 5) has 4 connections -> Proceed
- Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3(label 1) has 2 connections, Vertex 4(label 5) has 4 connections -> Proceed
- Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3(label 1) has 2 connections, Vertex 5(label 5) has 4 connections -> Proceed
- Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5(label 5) has 4 connections, Vertex 7(label 3) has 1 connection -> Proceed
- Edge (6, 5): Vertex 6(label 2) has 2 connections, Vertex 5(label 5) has 4 connections -> Proceed
- Edge (8, 9): Vertex 8(label 4) has 3 connections, Vertex 9(label 5) has 4 connections -> Proceed

Now, let's count the number of triangles:
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <3, 4, 5>

Total number of triangles: [2]
