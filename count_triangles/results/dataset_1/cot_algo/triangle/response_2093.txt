Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 9: 0 connections
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections

Next, we will go through the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (0, 3): Shared connections: 5, 7
- Edge (0, 5): Shared connections: 3
- Edge (0, 7): Shared connections: 3
- Edge (1, 4): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed
- Edge (3, 0): No need to process this edge again
- Edge (3, 2): No triangle formed
- Edge (3, 5): Shared connection: 0
- Edge (3, 7): Shared connection: 0
- Edge (4, 1): No need to process this edge again
- Edge (4, 6): No triangle formed
- Edge (4, 7): Shared connection: 0
- Edge (5, 0): No need to process this edge again
- Edge (5, 3): No need to process this edge again
- Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed
- Edge (6, 4): No need to process this edge again
- Edge (7, 0): No need to process this edge again
- Edge (7, 3): No need to process this edge again
- Edge (7, 4): No need to process this edge again
- Edge (8, 5): Shared connection: 0

Thus, we have found the following unique triangles: 
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
