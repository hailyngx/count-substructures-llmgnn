Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node in the graph:  
Node 1 has degree 3  
Node 2 has degree 3  
Node 3 has degree 2  
Node 4 has degree 1  
Node 5 has degree 1  
Node 6 has degree 2  
Node 7 has degree 3  
Node 8 has degree 5  
Node 9 has degree 1  
  
Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in non-decreasing order:  
Node 4 (degree 1) -> relabel as 1  
Node 5 (degree 1) -> relabel as 2  
Node 9 (degree 1) -> relabel as 3  
Node 3 (degree 2) -> relabel as 4  
Node 6 (degree 2) -> relabel as 5  
Node 1 (degree 3) -> relabel as 6  
Node 2 (degree 3) -> relabel as 7  
Node 7 (degree 3) -> relabel as 8  
Node 8 (degree 5) -> relabel as 9  

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
1. Edge (1, 2): Nodes 6 and 7 have a shared connection with node 8, forming a triangle.  
2. Edge (1, 4): No triangles are formed as node 6 does not have a shared connection with any node.  
3. Edge (1, 8): Nodes 6 and 8 have a shared connection with node 7, forming a triangle.  
4. Edge (2, 1): Nodes 7 and 6 have a shared connection with node 8, forming a triangle.  
5. Edge (2, 6): No triangles are formed as node 7 does not have a shared connection with any node.  
6. Edge (2, 8): Nodes 7 and 8 have a shared connection with node 6, forming a triangle.  
7. Edge (3, 5): No triangles are formed as neither node has a shared connection with any other node.  
8. Edge (3, 7): No triangles are formed as neither node has a shared connection with any other node.  
9. Edge (4, 1): No triangles are formed as node 6 does not have a shared connection with any node.  
10. Edge (5, 3): No triangles are formed as neither node has a shared connection with any other node.  
11. Edge (6, 2): No triangles are formed as node 7 does not have a shared connection with any node.  
12. Edge (6, 7): No triangles are formed as neither node has a shared connection with any other node.  
13. Edge (7, 3): No triangles are formed as neither node has a shared connection with any other node.  
14. Edge (7, 6): No triangles are formed as neither node has a shared connection with any other node.  
15. Edge (7, 8): Nodes 8 and 6 have a shared connection with node 7, forming a triangle.  
16. Edge (8, 1): Nodes 9 and 6 have a shared connection with node 8, forming a triangle.  
17. Edge (8, 2): Nodes 9 and 7 have a shared connection with node 8, forming a triangle.  
18. Edge (8, 7): Nodes 8, 6, and 7 form a triangle.  
19. Edge (8, 9): No triangles are formed as node 8 does not have a shared connection with any node.  

Total number of triangles: [5]  
Unique triangles: <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>
