Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 0: 0 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 1: 8 connections
Node 8: 8 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles:

<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 6>
<5, 8, 7>
<5, 8, 2>
<3, 8, 2>
<3, 8, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
<8, 4, 1>
<8, 6, 7>
<8, 6, 2>
<8, 7, 2>
<8, 7, 4>
<8, 7, 1>
