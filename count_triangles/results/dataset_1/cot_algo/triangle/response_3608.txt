Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices is: [8, 3, 5, 9, 2, 6, 7, 1, 4, 0].

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the given edges and the degree-based ordering method:

1. Starting with vertex 8:
    - No triangles can be formed involving vertex 8.

2. Moving to vertex 3:
    - No triangles can be formed involving vertex 3.

3. Moving to vertex 5:
    - No triangles can be formed involving vertex 5.

4. Moving to vertex 9:
    - No triangles can be formed involving vertex 9.

5. Moving to vertex 2:
    - Triangle: <2, 4, 6>

6. Moving to vertex 6:
    - Triangle: <1, 4, 6>
    - Triangle: <2, 3, 6>

7. Moving to vertex 7:
    - Triangle: <2, 4, 7>
    - Triangle: <3, 6, 7>

8. Moving to vertex 1:
    - Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
    - Triangle: <1, 4, 6>

9. Moving to vertex 4:
    - Triangle: <0, 4, 9>
    - Triangle: <1, 4, 6>
    - Triangle: <2, 4, 7>
    - Triangle: <3, 4, 6>
    - Triangle: <4, 7, 9>

10. Moving to vertex 0:
    - Triangle: <0, 4, 9>
    - Triangle: <0, 1, 4>

Finally, we count the total number of triangles: [11].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 9>, <0, 1, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 9>.
