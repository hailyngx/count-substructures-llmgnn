Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in non-decreasing order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 2 -> Label 0
Node 1 -> Label 1
Node 0 -> Label 2
Node 5 -> Label 3
Node 4 -> Label 4
Node 9 -> Label 5
Node 7 -> Label 6
Node 8 -> Label 7
Node 6 -> Label 8
Node 3 -> Label 9

The edges in the updated label format are: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7)

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 5]
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 6, 3>
<3, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
