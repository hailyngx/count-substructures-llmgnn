Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices will be:  
Node 3 (degree 1)  
Node 5 (degree 1)  
Node 0 (degree 2)  
Node 5 (degree 2)  
Node 9 (degree 3)  
Node 1 (degree 4)  
Node 4 (degree 4)  
Node 8 (degree 4)  
Node 2 (degree 5)  
Node 6 (degree 6)  

Now, we will go through the edges based on the nodes' labels and count the triangles:  
- Edge (0, 7) with shared connections 4, 6 forms triangle <0, 4, 6>.  
- Edge (1, 2) with shared connection 6 forms triangle <1, 2, 6>.  
- Edge (1, 6) with shared connection 2 forms triangle <1, 2, 6>.  
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (2, 1) with shared connection 6 forms triangle <1, 2, 6>.  
- Edge (2, 6) with shared connection 1 forms triangle <1, 2, 6>.  
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (4, 7) with shared connection 6 forms triangle <4, 6, 7>.  
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (6, 1) with shared connection 2 forms triangle <1, 2, 6>.  
- Edge (6, 2) with shared connection 1 forms triangle <1, 2, 6>.  
- Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (6, 7) with shared connections 0, 4 forms triangle <0, 4, 6>.  
- Edge (6, 8) with shared connections 4, 9 forms triangle <4, 6, 9>.  
- Edge (7, 0) with shared connection 6 forms triangle <0, 4, 6>.  
- Edge (7, 4) with shared connection 6 forms triangle <4, 6, 7>.  
- Edge (7, 6) with shared connections 0, 4 forms triangle <0, 4, 6>.  
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (8, 6) with shared connections 4, 9 forms triangle <4, 6, 9>.  
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.  
- Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]  
The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, and <4, 6, 9>.
