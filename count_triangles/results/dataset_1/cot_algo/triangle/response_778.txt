Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order and then re-labeling them. 

Sorted nodes by their degrees (number of connections) are as follows:
Node 7 (Degree 1)
Node 2 (Degree 2)
Node 6 (Degree 2)
Node 8 (Degree 3)
Node 4 (Degree 3)
Node 3 (Degree 3)
Node 0 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 4)
Node 5 (Degree 6)
Node 9 (Degree 7)

Based on the sorted nodes, the unique triangles and their count are as follows:
[15]
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 9, 7>, <1, 9, 4>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 9, 4>, <8, 9, 7>, <8, 9, 4>
