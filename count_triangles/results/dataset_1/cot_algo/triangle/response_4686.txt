Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we get the new labels for the vertices as follows:
Node 2: 0 connections
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 3: 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
1. (2, 3): No triangle formed
2. (5, 6): No triangle formed
3. (7, 8): No triangle formed
4. (8, 6): No triangle formed
5. (6, 3): Triangle <3, 6, 8> formed
6. (9, 3): Triangle <3, 6, 9> formed
7. (0, 1): Triangle <0, 1, 4> formed
8. (1, 0): No triangle formed
9. (3, 1): No triangle formed
10. (1, 3): No triangle formed
11. (3, 4): Triangle <3, 4, 9> formed
12. (4, 0): No triangle formed
13. (4, 1): No triangle formed
14. (4, 9): Triangle <4, 9, 3> formed

After considering all edges, we have found 4 unique triangles. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
