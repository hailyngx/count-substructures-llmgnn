Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels are:  
Node 0 - 4 connections  
Node 2 - 2 connections  
Node 3 - 1 connection  
Node 4 - 4 connections  
Node 5 - 3 connections  
Node 9 - 2 connections  
Node 6 - 4 connections  
Node 8 - 3 connections  
Node 7 - 5 connections  
Node 1 - 9 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Checking edges involving Node 0 (4 connections):  
- Edge (0, 1): Node 1 has 9 connections
- Edge (0, 7): Node 7 has 5 connections
- Edge (0, 8): Node 8 has 3 connections

Checking edges involving Node 2 (2 connections):  
- Edge (2, 5): Node 5 has 3 connections

Checking edges involving Node 3 (1 connection):  
No edges to check.

Checking edges involving Node 4 (4 connections):  
- Edge (4, 1): Node 1 has 9 connections
- Edge (4, 5): Node 5 has 3 connections
- Edge (4, 9): Node 9 has 2 connections

Checking edges involving Node 5 (3 connections):  
- Edge (5, 1): Node 1 has 9 connections

Checking edges involving Node 9 (2 connections):  
No edges to check.

Checking edges involving Node 6 (4 connections):  
- Edge (6, 1): Node 1 has 9 connections
- Edge (6, 7): Node 7 has 5 connections
- Edge (6, 8): Node 8 has 3 connections

Checking edges involving Node 8 (3 connections):  
- Edge (8, 6): Node 6 has 4 connections

Checking edges involving Node 7 (5 connections):  
- Edge (7, 0): Node 0 has 4 connections
- Edge (7, 1): Node 1 has 9 connections
- Edge (7, 2): Node 2 has 2 connections
- Edge (7, 6): Node 6 has 4 connections

Checking edges involving Node 1 (9 connections):  
- We do not consider any edge involving Node 1 as it has the highest number of connections.

Therefore, the triangles found are:
[8 triangles]
