Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0 has 3 connections.
Vertex 5 has 2 connections.
Vertices 6, 8, and 9 have 2 connections.
Vertices 2 and 7 have 4 connections.
Vertices 1 and 3 have 5 connections.
Vertex 4 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph.

We start with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 1):
   Shared connections: None

2. Edge (0, 6):
   Shared connections: None

3. Edge (0, 8):
   Shared connections: None

4. Edge (1, 2):
   Shared connections: None

5. Edge (1, 3):
   Shared connections: None

6. Edge (1, 4):
   Shared connections: None

7. Edge (2, 6):
   Shared connections: None

8. Edge (2, 7):
   Shared connections: None

9. Edge (3, 6):
   Shared connections: None

10. Edge (3, 9):
    Shared connections: None

11. Edge (4, 5):
    Shared connections: None

12. Edge (5, 7):
    Shared connections: None

In this graph, there are no triangles found. The total number of triangles is [0].
