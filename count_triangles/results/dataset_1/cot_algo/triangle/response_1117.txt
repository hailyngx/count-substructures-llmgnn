Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. Here are the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 7
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4

Based on this ordering, the new labels for the nodes will be:
- Node 0: new label 0 (degree 2)
- Node 1: new label 1 (degree 2)
- Node 2: new label 2 (degree 4)
- Node 3: new label 3 (degree 3)
- Node 4: new label 4 (degree 2)
- Node 5: new label 5 (degree 2)
- Node 6: new label 6 (degree 5)
- Node 7: new label 7 (degree 7)
- Node 8: new label 8 (degree 2)
- Node 9: new label 9 (degree 4)

Now, we will examine each edge, considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 6) forms triangles with nodes 4 and 7: <0, 4, 7>
- Edge (1, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1], and the unique triangle found is <0, 4, 7>.
