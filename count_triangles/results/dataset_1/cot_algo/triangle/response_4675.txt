Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in non-decreasing order, the vertices can be relabeled as: 3, 5, 6, 7, 0, 8, 9, 2. 
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order: (0, 3), (0, 8), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 0), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 7), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 2), (9, 8). 

Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections through the above edges results in:
Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 7>
