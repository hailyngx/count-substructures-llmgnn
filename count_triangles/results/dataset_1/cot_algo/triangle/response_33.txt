Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

0: 1 connection
1: 2 connections
5: 1 connection
7: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
8: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
9: 5 connections
2: 6 connections

Since we have 10 nodes with the exact number of connections mentioned above, we can now analyze the edges based on the order of their vertices:

1. (0, 7): Both 0 and 7 have one connection each. No triangle is formed.
2. (1, 2): No triangle is formed because node 1 has only 2 connections compared to node 2 with 6 connections.
3. (1, 4): No triangle is formed because node 1 has only 2 connections compared to node 4 with 2 connections.
4. (2, 1): No triangle is formed because node 2 has 6 connections, which is more than node 1's 2 connections.
5. (2, 3): No triangle is formed because node 2 has 6 connections, which is more than node 3's 4 connections.
6. (2, 6): No triangle is formed because node 2 has 6 connections, which is more than node 6's 2 connections.
7. (2, 8): A triangle <2, 8, 4> is formed.
8. (2, 9): Triangles <2, 9, 6> and <2, 9, 3> are formed.
9. (3, 2): No triangle is formed because node 3 has 4 connections, which is more than node 2's 6 connections.
10. (3, 5): No triangle is formed because node 3 has 4 connections, which is more than node 5's 1 connection.
11. (3, 7): No triangle is formed because node 3 has 4 connections, which is more than node 7's 2 connections.
12. (3, 9): A triangle <3, 9, 6> is formed.
13. (4, 1): No triangle is formed because node 4 has 2 connections, which is less than node 1's 2 connections.
14. (4, 8): No triangle is formed because node 4 has 2 connections, which is less than node 8's 3 connections.
15. (5, 3): No triangle is formed because node 5 has 1 connection, which is less than node 3's 4 connections.
16. (6, 2): No triangle is formed because node 6 has 2 connections, which is less than node 2's 6 connections.
17. (6, 9): No triangle is formed because node 6 has 2 connections, which is less than node 9's 5 connections.
18. (7, 0): No triangle is formed.
19. (7, 3): No triangle is formed because node 7 has 2 connections, which is less than node 3's 4 connections.
20. (8, 2): A triangle <8, 2, 4> is formed.
21. (8, 4): No triangle is formed because node 8 has 3 connections, which is less than node 4's 2 connections.
22. (8, 9): No triangle is formed because node 8 has 3 connections, which is less than node 9's 5 connections.
23. (9, 2): No triangle is formed because node 9 has 5 connections, which is more than node 2's 6 connections.
24. (9, 3): A triangle <9, 3, 6> is formed.
25. (9, 6): No triangle is formed because node 9 has 5 connections, which is more than node 6's 2 connections.
