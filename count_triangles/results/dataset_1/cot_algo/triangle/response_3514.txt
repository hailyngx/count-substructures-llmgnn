Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices in the graph based on their degree:
0: 1
1: 2
4: 1
5: 2
9: 2
2: 3
6: 4
8: 4
7: 5
3: 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start with the edges involving vertices with the lowest degrees. 

Checking the edges involving vertex 0 (degree 1):
- Edge (0, 3) involves vertex 3 (degree 5), so we'll skip this edge.

Checking the edges involving vertex 4 (degree 1):
- There are no other edges involving vertex 4.

Checking the edges involving vertex 9 (degree 2):
- There are no other edges involving vertex 9.

Checking the edges involving vertex 1 (degree 2):
- Edge (1, 3) involves vertex 3 (degree 5), so we'll skip this edge.
- Edge (1, 7) involves vertex 7 (degree 5), so we'll skip this edge.

Checking the edges involving vertex 5 (degree 2):
- Edge (5, 7) involves vertex 7 (degree 5), so we'll skip this edge.
- Edge (5, 9) involves vertex 9 (degree 2), but the two vertices of this edge already have a common neighbor, vertex 6, forming a triangle <5, 6, 9>.

Checking the edges involving vertex 2 (degree 3):
- Edge (2, 6) involves vertex 6 (degree 4), so we'll check for shared neighbors.
  - Vertex 2 has neighbors 6 and 7.
  - Vertex 6 has neighbors 2, 4, and 9.
  - The shared neighbor of 2 and 6 is vertex 6, forming a triangle <2, 6, 4>.
- Edge (2, 7) involves vertex 7 (degree 5), so we'll check for shared neighbors.
  - Vertex 2 has neighbors 6 and 8.
  - Vertex 7 has neighbors 1, 5, 8.
  - The shared neighbor of 2 and 7 is vertex 8, forming a triangle <2, 7, 8>.
- Edge (2, 8) involves vertex 8 (degree 4), so we'll check for shared neighbors.
  - Vertex 2 has neighbors 6 and 7.
  - Vertex 8 has neighbors 2, 3, 7.
  - The shared neighbor of 2 and 8 is vertex 7, forming a triangle <2, 8, 7>.

Checking the edges involving vertex 6 (degree 4):
- Edge (6, 9) involves vertex 9 (degree 2), but the two vertices of this edge already have a common neighbor, vertex 5, forming a triangle <5, 6, 9>.

Checking the edges involving vertex 8 (degree 4):
- There are no other edges involving vertex 8.

Checking the edges involving vertex 7 (degree 5):
- There are no edges left to consider for vertex 7.

Checking the edges involving vertex 3 (degree 5):
- There are no edges left to consider for vertex 3.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <5, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 4>, and <2, 7, 8>.
