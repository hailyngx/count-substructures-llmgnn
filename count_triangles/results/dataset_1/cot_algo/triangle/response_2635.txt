Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
- Node 6 (1 connection)
- Node 2 (1 connection)
- Node 5 (1 connection)
- Node 3 (2 connections)
- Node 0 (3 connections)
- Node 7 (3 connections)
- Node 1 (4 connections)
- Node 8 (5 connections)
- Node 9 (5 connections)
- Node 4 (6 connections)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles by looking for shared connections between vertices with lower labels. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 5, and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 9> 

So, the output is [5].
