Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by degree, the new labels for each node are: 0(1), 1(4), 2(4), 3(5), 4(3), 5(2), 6(1), 8(4), 9(2).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges with the lower labeled node having fewer connections.

Now, let's find the triangles formed by these edges:

For edge (0, 8): No triangles formed.
For edge (1, 3): Triangle formed: <1, 3, 2>.
For edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
For edge (2, 3): Triangle formed: <2, 3, 1>.
For edge (2, 4): No triangles formed.
For edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.
For edge (3, 1): No triangles formed.
For edge (3, 2): Triangle formed: <3, 2, 1>.
For edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.
For edge (3, 8): Triangle formed: <3, 8, 1>.
For edge (4, 2): No triangles formed.
For edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
For edge (5, 2): No triangles formed.
For edge (6, 3): No triangles formed.
For edge (8, 0): No triangles formed.
For edge (8, 1): No triangles formed.
For edge (8, 3): Triangle formed: <8, 3, 1>.
For edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 2>, <2, 3, 1>, <3, 8, 1>.
