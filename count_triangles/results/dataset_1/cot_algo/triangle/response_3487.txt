Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertex 3 has 1 connection.
Vertices 0, 1, 4, 5, 9 have 2 connections.
Vertices 7, 8 have 3 connections.
Vertex 6 has 4 connections.
Vertex 2 has 6 connections.

The sorted vertices are: 3, 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 7, 8, 6, 2.

By following the method described in the question, we find that the triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2>
<2, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
