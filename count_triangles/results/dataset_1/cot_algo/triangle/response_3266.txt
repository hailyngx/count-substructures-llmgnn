Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new vertex numbering is as follows:
Vertices: 0 (degree 3), 1 (degree 3), 7 (degree 3), 3 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 2 (degree 4), 9 (degree 4), 4 (degree 1), 5 (degree 1), 8 (degree 1).

Now, we will examine each edge to find triangles:
- Edge (0, 1): Shares a connection with vertex 3. Triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- Edge (0, 4): No triangles.
- Edge (0, 9): Shares connections with vertices 2 and 6. Triangles <0, 2, 9> and <0, 6, 9>.
- Edge (1, 0): Already counted.
- Edge (1, 3): Shares a connection with vertex 0. Triangle <1, 3, 0>.
- Edge (1, 7): Shares connections with vertices 3 and 0. Triangles <1, 3, 7> and <1, 0, 7>.
- Edge (2, 3): Shares connections with vertices 6 and 9. Triangles <2, 3, 6> and <2, 3, 9>.
- Edge (2, 6): Shares a connection with vertex 3. Triangle <2, 6, 3>.
- Edge (2, 9): Shares a connection with vertex 0. Triangle <2, 9, 0>.
- Edge (3, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (3, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangles.
- Edge (3, 6): Shares a connection with vertex 2. Triangle <3, 6, 2>.
- Edge (3, 7): Shares a connection with vertex 1. Triangle <3, 7, 1>.
- Edge (4, 0): No triangles.
- Edge (5, 3): No triangles.
- Edge (6, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (6, 3): Already counted.
- Edge (6, 9): Already counted.
- Edge (7, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (7, 3): Already counted.
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles.
- Edge (8, 7): No triangles.
- Edge (9, 0): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 6): Already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 0, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, and <2, 3, 9>.
