Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, sort the vertices by their degree:
Vertex 2: 0 connections
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections

Now, relabel the vertices accordingly:
2 -> 0
4 -> 1
6 -> 2
5 -> 3
1 -> 4
3 -> 5
7 -> 6
9 -> 7
0 -> 8
8 -> 9

Now, check each edge and count the number of triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 0, 8>
<5, 4, 8>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 3, 9>
<8, 0, 9>
<8, 3, 5>
<8, 3, 9>
<8, 5, 9>
<9, 0, 7>
<9, 0, 8>
<9, 7, 8>

Counting the unique triangles, we find a total of 15 triangles. Therefore, the answer is [15].
