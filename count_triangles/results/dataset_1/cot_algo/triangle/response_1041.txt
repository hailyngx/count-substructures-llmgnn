Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles in the given graph:

Sorted vertices by their number of connections:
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections

Based on the sorted vertices, we will examine the edges in the following order:
(1, 0), (3, 9), (8, 2), (9, 5), (2, 7), (0, 4), (5, 6), (4, 7), (7, 6)

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 4>
