Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method, first sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 6, 4, 1, 0, 3, 7, 8, 5, 2, 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
(0, 2): No triangles
(0, 9): No triangles
(1, 3): No triangles
(1, 9): No triangles
(2, 0): No triangles
(2, 4): No triangles
(3, 1): No triangles
(3, 7): No triangles
(4, 2): No triangles
(5, 7): No triangles
(5, 8): No triangles
(5, 9): <5, 9, 0>
(6, 9): No triangles
(7, 3): No triangles
(7, 5): No triangles
(7, 8): <7, 8, 5>
(8, 5): No triangles
(8, 7): <8, 7, 5>
(8, 9): <8, 9, 5>
(9, 0): No triangles
(9, 1): No triangles
(9, 5): <9, 5, 8>
(9, 6): No triangles
(9, 8): <9, 8, 5>

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <5, 9, 0>, <7, 8, 5>, <8, 9, 5>, <9, 8, 5>
