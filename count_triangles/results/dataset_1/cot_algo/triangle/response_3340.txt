Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0: 2 edges
Node 1: 3 edges
Node 2: 2 edges
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 9: 1 edge
Node 4: 5 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 3: 6 edges
Node 7: 4 edges

Now, we will relabel the vertices from 0 to 9 based on their degrees:

Node 9: 1 edge
Node 0: 2 edges
Node 2: 2 edges
Node 4: 2 edges
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 1: 3 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 3: 6 edges

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13].
