Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we have the following relabeling:

Node 6: degree 3  
Node 0: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 4: degree 5  
Node 9: degree 5  
Node 1: degree 6  
Node 7: degree 6  
Node 3: degree 7  
Node 5: degree 8  

Next, we will check the edges, keeping in mind that the vertex with a lower label should have fewer connections.

Starting with the edges:
(0, 4) Forms a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 4, 5>
(0, 6) Does not form a triangle.
(1, 3) Does not form a triangle.
(1, 5) Forms a triangle with vertex 8: <1, 5, 8>
(1, 8) Does not form a triangle.
(1, 9) Forms a triangle with vertex 2: <1, 9, 2>
(2, 3) Does not form a triangle.
(2, 7) Forms a triangle with vertex 0: <2, 7, 0>
(2, 9) Does not form a triangle.
(3, 1) Does not form a triangle.
(3, 2) Does not form a triangle.
(3, 5) Forms a triangle with vertex 8: <3, 5, 8>
(3, 7) Does not form a triangle.
(3, 8) Forms a triangle with vertex 5: <3, 8, 5>
(4, 0) Does not form a triangle.
(4, 5) Forms a triangle with vertex 7: <4, 5, 7>
(4, 7) Forms a triangle with vertex 5: <4, 7, 5>
(5, 1) Does not form a triangle.
(5, 3) Forms a triangle with vertex 8: <5, 3, 8>
(5, 4) Forms a triangle with vertex 7: <5, 4, 7>
(5, 7) Forms a triangle with vertex 8: <5, 7, 8>
(5, 8) Does not form a triangle.
(6, 0) Does not form a triangle.
(6, 7) Does not form a triangle.
(6, 9) Forms a triangle with vertex 2: <6, 9, 2>
(7, 2) Does not form a triangle.
(7, 3) Forms a triangle with vertex 0: <7, 3, 0>
(7, 4) Forms a triangle with vertex 5: <7, 4, 5>
(7, 5) Forms a triangle with vertex 8: <7, 5, 8>
(7, 6) Does not form a triangle.
(8, 1) Does not form a triangle.
(8, 3) Forms a triangle with vertex 5: <8, 3, 5>
(8, 5) Does not form a triangle.
(8, 9) Forms a triangle with vertex 1: <8, 9, 1>
(9, 1) Does not form a triangle.
(9, 2) Forms a triangle with vertex 6: <9, 2, 6>
(9, 6) Does not form a triangle.
(9, 8) Forms a triangle with vertex 1: <9, 8, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 9, 2>, <2, 7, 0>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 8, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 5>, <5, 4, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <8, 9, 1>.
