Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on their number of connections:
- Node 3 has 2 connections.
- Nodes 2, 4, and 2 have 2 connections.
- Nodes 1, 5, and 8 have 4 connections.
- Nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9 have 5 connections.

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph:
1. Node 3: No triangles involving node 3.
2. Node 2: No triangles involving node 2.
3. Node 4: No triangles involving node 4.
4. Node 1: Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5 <0, 1, 5>.
5. Node 5: Forms triangles with nodes 0, 6, and 7 <0, 5, 6> and <0, 5, 7>.
6. Node 8: Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 9 <1, 8, 9>.
7. Node 0: Forms triangles with nodes 1, 5, 6, and 7 <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, and <0, 5, 7>.
8. Node 6: Forms triangles with nodes 5, 7, and 9 <0, 5, 6> and <0, 5, 7>.
9. Node 7: Forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 9 <0, 5, 7>.
10. Node 9: Forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 8 <0, 5, 7>.

Overall, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9] as shown above.
