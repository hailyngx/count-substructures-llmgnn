Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Node 3 - label 0 (Degree: 5)
Node 4 - label 1 (Degree: 4)
Node 1 - label 2 (Degree: 2)
Node 5 - label 3 (Degree: 1)
Node 7 - label 4 (Degree: 4)
Node 6 - label 5 (Degree: 1)
Node 0 - label 6 (Degree: 3)
Node 8 - label 7 (Degree: 7)
Node 9 - label 8 (Degree: 7)

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 3) forms triangles with nodes 4 and 8. Triangle <0, 3, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle with node 7. Triangle <0, 8, 7>.
3. Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 7, and 8. Triangle <0, 9, 1>.
4. Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with node 9. Triangle <1, 7, 9>.
5. Edge (3, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 4. Triangle <3, 0, 4>.
6. Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with node 8. Triangle <3, 4, 8>.
7. Edge (4, 3) forms a triangle with node 8. Triangle <4, 3, 8>.
8. Edge (4, 8) forms a triangle with node 7. Triangle <4, 8, 7>.
9. Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 1. Triangle <4, 9, 0>.
10. Edge (5, 8) does not form any triangles.
11. Edge (6, 9) does not form any triangles.
12. Edge (7, 1) does not form any triangles.
13. Edge (7, 8) forms two triangles with nodes 0 and 4. Triangles <7, 8, 0> and <7, 8, 4>.
14. Edge (7, 9) forms a triangle with node 0. Triangle <7, 9, 0>.
15. Edge (8, 0) forms a triangle with node 3. Triangle <8, 0, 3>.
16. Edge (8, 3) forms a triangle with node 4. Triangle <8, 3, 4>.
17. Edge (8, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 0. Triangle <8, 4, 3>.
18. Edge (8, 5) does not form any triangles.
19. Edge (8, 7) forms a triangle with node 4. Triangle <8, 7, 4>.
20. Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle with node 7. Triangle <8, 9, 7>.
21. Edge (9, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 7. Triangle <9, 0, 1>.
22. Edge (9, 1) does not form any triangles.
23. Edge (9, 4) forms a triangle with node 7. Triangle <9, 4, 7>.
24. Edge (9, 6) does not form any triangles.
25. Edge (9, 7) forms a triangle with node 8. Triangle <9, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
