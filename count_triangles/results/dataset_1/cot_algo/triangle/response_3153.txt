Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 5

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 3: Node 0
- Node 5: Node 1
- Node 7: Node 2
- Node 0: Node 3
- Node 9: Node 4
- Node 1: Node 5
- Node 5: Node 6
- Node 8: Node 7
- Node 2: Node 8
- Node 4: Node 9

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
- Node 0 (Node 3) is connected to Node 2 (Node 8) and Node 8 (Node 7), forming a triangle <0, 2, 8>.
- Node 0 (Node 3) is connected to Node 8 (Node 7) and Node 4 (Node 9), forming a triangle <0, 8, 4>.
- Node 0 (Node 3) is connected to Node 8 (Node 7) and Node 2 (Node 8), forming a triangle <0, 8, 2>.
- Node 0 (Node 3) is connected to Node 2 (Node 8) and Node 1 (Node 5), forming a triangle <0, 2, 1>.

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
