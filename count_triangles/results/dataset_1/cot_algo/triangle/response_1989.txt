Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 7 has 0 connections. 
Nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9 have 1 connection each. 
Nodes 4, 8 have 2 connections each. 
Nodes 0, 2, and 5 have 4 connections each.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (1, 3): Forms a triangle with node 1, 3, and their shared connection 2. 
- Edge (3, 4): Forms a triangle with node 3, 4, and their shared connection 0.
- Edge (4, 0): Forms a triangle with node 4, 0, and their shared connection 3.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 2>, <3, 4, 0>, and <4, 0, 3>.
