Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices: 9(0), 5(1), 2(2), 3(3), 4(4), 6(5), 7(6), 8(7), 1(8), 0(9)

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

New labels: 0(0), 1(1), 2(2), 3(3), 4(4), 5(5), 6(6), 7(7), 8(8), 9(9)

Next, we will check for shared connections between vertices with lower labels in each edge:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 6>
<5, 1, 7>
<6, 3, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
