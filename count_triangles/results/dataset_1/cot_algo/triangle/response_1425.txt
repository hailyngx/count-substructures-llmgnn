Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices by their number of connections, the graph can be represented as follows: 
Vertices: 0 (degree 2), 1 (degree 3), 5 (degree 3), 9 (degree 3), 4 (degree 4), 7 (degree 4), 2 (degree 4), 8 (degree 4), 3 (degree 5), 6 (degree 0)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's identify the triangles:

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <3, 7, 4>
- <3, 8, 9>
- <8, 5, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 9]
