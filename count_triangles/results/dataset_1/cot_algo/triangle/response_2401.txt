Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: 

0 (degree 2), 1 (degree 2), 4 (degree 2), 5 (degree 1), 6 (degree 0), 2 (degree 4), 3 (degree 4), 7 (degree 3), 8 (degree 4), 9 (degree 4).

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle 3: <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle 4: <2, 7, 3>
- Triangle 5: <2, 9, 3>
- Triangle 6: <2, 9, 8>
- Triangle 7: <5, 7, 3>
- Triangle 8: <7, 3, 9>
- Triangle 9: <8, 4, 1>
- Triangle 10: <9, 8, 4>
- Triangle 11: <9, 8, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
