Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, the vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are: 3, 0, 1, 2, 7, 9, 6, 8, 5, 4.

Using degree-based ordering, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Analyzing the edges based on this criterion, we can find the triangles:

1. Edge (2, 7) - No triangle
2. Edge (3, 8) - No triangle
3. Edge (0, 5) - No triangle
4. Edge (1, 4) - Triangle: <1, 4, 8>
5. Edge (4, 6) - Triangle: <4, 6, 9>
6. Edge (4, 7) - Triangle: <4, 7, 9>
7. Edge (4, 9) - Triangle: <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>
8. Edge (5, 6) - Triangle: <5, 6, 9>
9. Edge (5, 9) - Triangle: <5, 6, 9>
10. Edge (6, 7) - No triangle
11. Edge (8, 9) - No triangle

Thus, the total number of triangles is [5], and the unique triangles found are: <1, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 9>.
