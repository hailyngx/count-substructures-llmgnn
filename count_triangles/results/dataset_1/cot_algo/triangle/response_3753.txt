Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 0 (degree 5) -> Node 7 
Node 1 (degree 4) -> Node 6 
Node 2 (degree 3) -> Node 8 
Node 4 (degree 4) -> Node 9 
Node 5 (degree 1) -> Node 0 
Node 6 (degree 4) -> Node 2 
Node 7 (degree 3) -> Node 1 
Node 8 (degree 5) -> Node 3 
Node 9 (degree 6) -> Node 4 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3): Node 7 and Node 3 have a shared connection at Node 8. Triangle <7, 3, 8> is found.
2. Edge (0, 5): Node 7 and Node 0 have no shared connections.
3. Edge (0, 6): Node 7 and Node 2 have no shared connections.
4. Edge (0, 8): Node 7 and Node 3 have a shared connection at Node 8. Triangle <7, 3, 8> is found.
5. Edge (0, 9): Node 7 and Node 4 have no shared connections.
6. Edge (1, 2): Node 6 and Node 8 have no shared connections.
7. Edge (1, 3): Node 6 and Node 3 have a shared connection at Node 8. Triangle <6, 3, 8> is found.
8. Edge (1, 8): Node 6 and Node 3 have a shared connection at Node 8. Triangle <6, 3, 8> is found.
9. Edge (1, 9): Node 6 and Node 4 have no shared connections.
10. Edge (2, 3): Node 8 and Node 3 have a shared connection at Node 8. Triangle <8, 3, 8> is found.

12. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 and Node 2 have no shared connections.
13. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 and Node 8 have a shared connection at Node 8. Triangle <3, 8, 8> is found.
14. Edge (4, 7): Node 9 and Node 1 have no shared connections.
15. Edge (4, 8): Node 9 and Node 3 have a shared connection at Node 8. Triangle <9, 3, 8> is found.
16. Edge (4, 9): Node 9 and Node 4 have no shared connections.
17. Edge (5, 0): Node 0 and Node 7 have no shared connections.
18. Edge (6, 0): Node 2 and Node 7 have no shared connections.
19. Edge (6, 3): Node 2 and Node 3 have no shared connections.
20. Edge (6, 7): Node 2 and Node 1 have no shared connections.
21. Edge (7, 4): Node 1 and Node 9 have no shared connections.
22. Edge (7, 6): Node 1 and Node 2 have no shared connections.
23. Edge (7, 9): Node 1 and Node 4 have no shared connections.
24. Edge (8, 0): Node 3 and Node 7 have a shared connection at Node 8. Triangle <3, 7, 8> is found.
25. Edge (8, 1): Node 3 and Node 6 have a shared connection at Node 8. Triangle <3, 6, 8> is found.
26. Edge (8, 3): Node 3 and Node 8 have a shared connection at Node 8. Triangle <3, 8, 8> is found.
27. Edge (8, 4): Node 3 and Node 9 have no shared connections.
28. Edge (8, 9): Node 3 and Node 4 have no shared connections.
29. Edge (9, 0): Node 4 and Node 7 have no shared connections.
30. Edge (9, 1): Node 4 and Node 6 have no shared connections.
31. Edge (9, 2): Node 4 and Node 8 have no shared connections.
32. Edge (9, 4): Node 4 and Node 9 have no shared connections.
33. Edge (9, 7): Node 4 and Node 1 have no shared connections.
34. Edge (9, 8): Node 4 and Node 3 have no shared connections.

The total number of triangles is [4], and the unique triangles found are <7, 3, 8>, <6, 3, 8>, <3, 8, 8>, <3, 6, 8>.
