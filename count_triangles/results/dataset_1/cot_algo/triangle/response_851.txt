Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices will be as follows:
- Node 3 will be labeled as 0
- Nodes 2 and 8 will be labeled as 1
- Nodes 1 and 9 will be labeled as 2
- Nodes 0, 6, and 5 will be labeled as 3
- Nodes 4 and 7 will be labeled as 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge.

After applying this method, we find that there are:
- 8 triangles in total, which can be listed as follows: 
[<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 7>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 4, 5>]
