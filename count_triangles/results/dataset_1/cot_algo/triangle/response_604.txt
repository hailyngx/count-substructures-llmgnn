Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. 

The vertices with their respective degrees are:
Vertex 0: 2
Vertex 1: 2
Vertex 2: 3
Vertex 4: 1
Vertex 7: 3
Vertex 9: 2
Vertex 8: 3
Vertex 6: 4
Vertex 5: 8

Next, we will check each edge based on the ordering of vertices:

1. Vertex 0 and Vertex 5: Both have 2 connections. They share connections with Vertex 2, forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
2. Vertex 0 and Vertex 8: Proceed with caution as Vertex 0 has 2 connections which is less than Vertex 8's 3 connections.
3. Vertex 1 and Vertex 5: Both have 2 connections. They share connections with Vertex 7, forming a triangle <1, 5, 7>.
4. Vertex 1 and Vertex 7: Proceed with caution as Vertex 1 has 2 connections which is less than Vertex 7's 3 connections.
5. Vertex 2 and Vertex 5: Proceed with caution as Vertex 2 has 3 connections which is more than Vertex 5's 2 connections.
6. Vertex 2 and Vertex 6: Proceed with caution as Vertex 2 has 3 connections which is more than Vertex 6's 4 connections.
7. Vertex 2 and Vertex 8: Proceed with caution as Vertex 2 has 3 connections which is less than Vertex 8's 3 connections.
8. Vertex 4 and Vertex 5: Proceed with caution as Vertex 4 has 1 connection which is less than Vertex 5's 8 connections.
9. Vertex 5 and Vertex 7: Proceed with caution as Vertex 5 has 8 connections which is more than Vertex 7's 3 connections.
10. Vertex 5 and Vertex 9: Proceed with caution as Vertex 5 has 8 connections which is more than Vertex 9's 2 connections.
11. Vertex 6 and Vertex 2: Proceed with caution as Vertex 6 has 4 connections which is more than Vertex 2's 3 connections.
12. Vertex 6 and Vertex 7: Proceed with caution as Vertex 6 has 4 connections which is more than Vertex 7's 3 connections.
13. Vertex 6 and Vertex 8: Proceed with caution as Vertex 6 has 4 connections which is more than Vertex 8's 3 connections.
14. Vertex 6 and Vertex 9: Proceed with caution as Vertex 6 has 4 connections which is less than Vertex 9's 2 connections.
15. Vertex 7 and Vertex 1: Proceed with caution as Vertex 7 has 3 connections which is more than Vertex 1's 2 connections.
16. Vertex 7 and Vertex 5: Proceed with caution as Vertex 7 has 3 connections which is less than Vertex 5's 8 connections.
17. Vertex 7 and Vertex 6: Proceed with caution as Vertex 7 has 3 connections which is less than Vertex 6's 4 connections.
18. Vertex 8 and Vertex 0: Proceed with caution as Vertex 8 has 3 connections which is less than Vertex 0's 2 connections.
19. Vertex 8 and Vertex 2: Proceed with caution as Vertex 8 has 3 connections which is less than Vertex 2's 3 connections.
20. Vertex 8 and Vertex 6: Proceed with caution as Vertex 8 has 3 connections which is less than Vertex 6's 4 connections.
21. Vertex 9 and Vertex 5: Proceed with caution as Vertex 9 has 2 connections which is less than Vertex 5's 8 connections.
22. Vertex 9 and Vertex 6: Proceed with caution as Vertex 9 has 2 connections which is less than Vertex 6's 4 connections.

After considering all edges, the total number of triangles is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5> and <1, 5, 7>.
