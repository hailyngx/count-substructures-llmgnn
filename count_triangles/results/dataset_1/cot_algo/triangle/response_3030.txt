Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be: 
Vertex 0 (degree 4) 
Vertex 2 (degree 2) 
Vertex 5 (degree 2) 
Vertex 7 (degree 3) 
Vertex 6 (degree 2) 
Vertex 1 (degree 4) 
Vertex 9 (degree 4) 
Vertex 8 (degree 5) 
Vertex 3 (degree 5) 
Vertex 4 (degree 5)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles and find the unique triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 5]
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
