Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. The vertices with their connections are as follows:
(1) - 1 connection
(3) - 1 connection
(7) - 2 connections
(6) - 2 connections
(0) - 4 connections
(4) - 4 connections
(5) - 4 connections
(2) - 5 connections
(8) - 5 connections
(9) - 6 connections

Based on the sorting, the new labels for the vertices are:
(1) - 1
(3) - 2
(7) - 3
(6) - 4
(0) - 5
(4) - 6
(5) - 7
(2) - 8
(8) - 9
(9) - 10

Now, we will consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to count the number of triangles:

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <2, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
