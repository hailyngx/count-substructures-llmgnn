Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for each vertex are as follows: 
- Vertex 0 has 0 connections.
- Vertex 5 has 1 connection.
- Vertex 7 has 2 connections.
- Vertices 1 and 9 have 4 connections.
- Vertices 4 and 6 have 5 connections.
- Vertices 2 and 8 have 6 connections.
- Vertex 3 has 7 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles and unique triangles formed by the edges provided:

1. Edge (0, 3) forms triangles with: <0, 3, 6>.
2. Edge (1, 2) forms triangles with: <1, 2, 6>.
3. Edge (1, 4) forms triangles with: <1, 4, 8>.
4. Edge (1, 6) forms triangles with: <1, 6, 2> and <1, 6, 4>.
5. Edge (1, 8) does not form any triangles.
6. Edge (2, 1) forms triangles with: <2, 1, 6>.
7. Edge (2, 6) forms triangles with: <2, 6, 1>.
8. Edge (2, 7) does not form any triangles.
9. Edge (2, 8) does not form any triangles.
10. Edge (3, 0) forms triangles with: <3, 0, 6>.
11. Edge (3, 6) forms triangles with: <3, 6, 1> and <3, 6, 7>.
12. Edge (3, 7) does not form any triangles.
