Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 4: 0 connections
Node 9: 0 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can find the triangles in the graph:
1. For edge (0, 2): Node 0 has connections with Node 2. Shared connections: 1, 5, 7. Triangle: <0, 2, 7>
2. For edge (0, 3): Node 0 has connections with Node 3. Shared connections: 5. Triangle: <0, 3, 5>
3. For edge (0, 4): Node 0 has connections with Node 4. No triangle formed.
4. For edge (0, 5): Node 0 has connections with Node 5. Shared connections: 2, 3, 7. Triangles: <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 7>
5. For edge (0, 6): Node 0 has connections with Node 6. No triangle formed.
6. For edge (1, 2): Node 1 has connections with Node 2. No triangle formed.
7. For edge (1, 6): Node 1 has connections with Node 6. No triangle formed.
8. For edge (1, 7): Node 1 has connections with Node 7. Shared connections: 2. Triangle: <1, 7, 2>
9. For edge (1, 8): Node 1 has connections with Node 8. No triangle formed.
10. For edge (2, 5): Node 2 has connections with Node 5. Shared connections: 0, 3, 7. Triangles: <2, 5, 0>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 7>
11. For edge (3, 5): Node 3 has connections with Node 5. No triangle formed.
12. For edge (4, 7): Node 4 has connections with Node 7. No triangle formed.
13. For edge (6, 8): Node 6 has connections with Node 8. No triangle formed.
14. For edge (6, 9): Node 6 has connections with Node 9. No triangle formed.
15. For edge (7, 8): Node 7 has connections with Node 8. Shared connections: 1. Triangle: <7, 8, 1>
16. For edge (8, 9): Node 8 has connections with Node 9. No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [9]
