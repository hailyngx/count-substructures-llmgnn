Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes sorted by degree (number of connections):
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections

Based on the method, we will now label the nodes as follows:
Node 0 -> A
Node 2 -> B
Node 8 -> C
Node 6 -> D
Node 7 -> E
Node 5 -> F
Node 9 -> G
Node 1 -> H
Node 3 -> I
Node 4 -> J
