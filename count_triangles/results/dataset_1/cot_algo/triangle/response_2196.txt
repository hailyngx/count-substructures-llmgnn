Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we list the degrees of each vertex:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 5
- Vertex 6: degree 6
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 2

Next, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 4 (degree 1) is relabeled to 0
- Vertices 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9 (degree 2) are relabeled to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively
- Vertices 3 and 5 (degree 3 and 5) are relabeled to 6 and 7 respectively
- Vertex 6 (degree 6) is relabeled to 8

Now, we list the edges with the new labels:
(1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1)

Now, let's count the triangles formed based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Triangle 1: <1, 7, 8>
- Triangle 2: <1, 2, 6>

Count of triangles: [2]
