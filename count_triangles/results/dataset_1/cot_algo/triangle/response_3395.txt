Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the reordered labels are as follows:  
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
  
Now, by using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph.  

The triangles found in the graph are:  
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <7, 8, 9>
- <2, 7, 8>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
