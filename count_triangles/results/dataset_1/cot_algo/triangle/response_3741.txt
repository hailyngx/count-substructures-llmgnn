Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 1

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:
- Node 1: degree 1 (Node 1 remains as Node 1)
- Node 4: degree 1 (Node 4 remains as Node 4)
- Node 9: degree 1 (Node 9 remains as Node 9)
- Node 0: degree 2 (Node 0 becomes Node 2)
- Node 6: degree 2 (Node 6 becomes Node 3)
- Node 3: degree 3 (Node 3 becomes Node 4)
- Node 7: degree 4 (Node 7 becomes Node 5)
- Node 8: degree 4 (Node 8 becomes Node 6)
- Node 5: degree 4 (Node 5 becomes Node 7)

Now, we go through the edges in the order given and count the triangles:
1. (0, 5): No triangles
2. (0, 8): No triangles
3. (1, 5): No triangles
4. (3, 5): Triangle <3, 5, 7>
5. (3, 6): No triangles
6. (3, 7): No triangles
7. (4, 8): No triangles
8. (5, 0): No triangles
9. (5, 1): No triangles
10. (5, 3): Triangle <3, 5, 7>
11. (6, 3): No triangles
12. (6, 7): No triangles
13. (7, 3): Triangle <3, 5, 7>
14. (7, 6): Triangle <3, 5, 7>
15. (7, 8): No triangles
16. (7, 9): No triangles
17. (8, 0): No triangles
18. (8, 4): No triangles
19. (8, 7): No triangles
20. (9, 7): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <3, 5, 7>
