Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:

Vertex 0 with 2 connections
Vertex 5 with 2 connections
Vertex 8 with 2 connections
Vertex 9 with 2 connections
Vertex 3 with 3 connections
Vertex 6 with 4 connections
Vertex 1 with 5 connections
Vertex 2 with 3 connections
Vertex 7 with 6 connections
Vertex 4 with 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles:

1. (0, 1) shared connection with vertex 2 forming triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. (0, 2) shared connection with vertex 7 forming triangle <0, 2, 7>
3. (1, 3) shared connection with vertex 7 forming triangle <1, 3, 7>
4. (1, 7) no triangle formed
5. (2, 7) shared connection with vertex 0 forming triangle <0, 2, 7>
6. (3, 4) shared connection with vertex 7 forming triangle <3, 4, 7>
7. (4, 7) shared connection with vertices 1 and 3 forming triangle <1, 4, 7> and <3, 4, 7>
8. (6, 7) shared connection with vertices 0, 2, and 4 forming triangle <2, 6, 7> and <4, 6, 7>
9. (6, 8) no triangle formed
10. (7, 4) shared connection with vertices 0, 3 forming triangle <0, 4, 7> and <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
