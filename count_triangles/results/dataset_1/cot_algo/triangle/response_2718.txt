Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertices: 1(2 connections), 2(2 connections), 8(2 connections), 9(2 connections), 6(3 connections), 1(4 connections), 0(5 connections), 3(5 connections), 4(6 connections), 7(6 connections)
