Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method.

First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 1 (Degree 0) -> Node 0
Node 0 (Degree 4) -> Node 1
Node 2 (Degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 6 (Degree 1) -> Node 3
Node 7 (Degree 1) -> Node 4
Node 3 (Degree 1) -> Node 5
Node 8 (Degree 4) -> Node 6
Node 4 (Degree 3) -> Node 7
Node 9 (Degree 4) -> Node 8
Node 5 (Degree 5) -> Node 9

Now, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
