Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 - Degree 1
Node 1 - Degree 2
Node 3 - Degree 2
Node 4 - Degree 3
Node 5 - Degree 1
Node 6 - Degree 2
Node 7 - Degree 1
Node 2 - Degree 5
Node 8 - Degree 6
Node 9 - Degree 6
