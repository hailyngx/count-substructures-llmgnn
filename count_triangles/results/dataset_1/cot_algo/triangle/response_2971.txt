Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

0 (degree 1)
5 (degree 1)
4 (degree 1)
3 (degree 2)
1 (degree 4)
7 (degree 4)
8 (degree 4)
6 (degree 5)
2 (degree 6)
9 (degree 9)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <3, 6, 9>
4. <4, 9, 5>
5. <6, 7, 8>
6. <6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
