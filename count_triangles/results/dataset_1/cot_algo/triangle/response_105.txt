Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections

Now, we will check for triangles based on the edges:

- Edge (0, 2): Both vertices have 1 common connection with vertex 7 forming a triangle <0, 2, 7>.
- Edge (1, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 7>
