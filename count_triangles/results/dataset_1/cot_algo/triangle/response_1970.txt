Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices by degree:
0: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
2: 5 connections
4: 5 connections
6: 5 connections
9: 5 connections
5: 3 connections
7: 4 connections

Next, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (0, 1) -> Shared connections:  = {4,5} -> Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
2. (0, 4) -> Shared connections:  = {1,5} -> Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
3. (0, 5) -> Shared connections:  = {1,4} -> Triangle: <0, 1, 5>
4. (0, 9) -> Shared connections:  = {2,3} -> Triangle: <0, 2, 9>
5. (1, 0) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
6. (1, 2) -> Shared connections:  = {4,3} -> Triangle: <1, 2, 4>
7. (1, 3) -> Shared connections:  = {4,2,9} -> Triangle: <1, 2, 4>
8. (2, 1) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
9. (2, 4) -> Shared connections:  = {1,3} -> Triangle: <1, 2, 4>
10. (2, 6) -> Shared connections:  = {5,7} -> Triangle: <2, 6, 5>
11. (2, 7) -> Shared connections:  = {6,8,9} -> Triangle: <2, 6, 7>
12. (2, 9) -> Shared connections:  = {0,3,7,8} -> Triangle: <0, 2, 9>
13. (3, 1) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
14. (3, 4) -> Shared connections:  = {1,2} -> Triangle: <1, 3, 2>
15. (3, 9) -> Shared connections:  = {0,2,7,8} -> Triangle: <0, 3, 7>
16. (4, 0) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
17. (4, 2) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
18. (4, 3) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
19. (4, 8) -> Shared connections:  = {2,5,7,9} -> Triangle: <2, 4, 8>
20. (5, 0) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
21. (5, 6) -> Shared connections:  = {2,7} -> Triangle: <2, 5, 6>
22. (5, 8) -> Shared connections:  = {4,7,9} -> Triangle: <4, 5, 8>
23. (6, 2) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
24. (6, 5) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
25. (6, 7) -> Shared connections:  = {2,5,8} -> Triangle: <2, 6, 7>
26. (7, 2) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
27. (7, 6) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
28. (7, 8) -> Shared connections:  = {2,4,5,9} -> Triangle: <2, 7, 8>
29. (7, 9) -> Shared connections:  = {0,2,3,8} -> Triangle: <0, 7, 9>
30. (8, 4) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
31. (8, 5) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
32. (8, 7) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
33. (8, 9) -> Shared connections:  = {0,2,7} -> Triangle: <0, 8, 9>
34. (9, 0) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
35. (9, 2) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
36. (9, 3) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
37. (9, 7) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
38. (9, 8) -> Skip, because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
