Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the degree of each node:

- Node 0: Degree 1
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 0
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 5
- Node 5: Degree 5
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 2
- Node 9: Degree 4

Based on the degrees, we relabel the nodes as follows:
- Node 0 → Node 1
- Node 1 → Node 2
- Node 2 → Node 3
- Node 3 → Node 4
- Node 4 → Node 5
- Node 5 → Node 6
- Node 6 → Node 7
- Node 7 → Node 8
- Node 8 → Node 9
- Node 9 → Node 10

Next, we list the edges in the correct format after relabeling:
(1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 10) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9)

We will now count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method.

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 10>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 10>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 10>
