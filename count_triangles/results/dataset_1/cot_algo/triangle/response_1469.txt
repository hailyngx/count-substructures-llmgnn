Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:

0 -> 1 connections  
1 -> 4 connections  
8 -> 1 connections  
6 -> 4 connections  
9 -> 4 connections  
4 -> 4 connections  
5 -> 3 connections  
2 -> 4 connections  
7 -> 6 connections  
3 -> 4 connections  

We will now analyze the edges based on the new labels:

- Edge (0, 6): Forms a triangle with vertex 9.  
- Edge (0, 9): Forms a triangle with vertices 6 and 7.  
- Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed.  
- Edge (1, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 5.  
- Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.  
- Edge (1, 7): Forms a triangle with vertices 2 and 4.  
- Edge (2, 1): No triangles formed.  
- Edge (2, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 7.  
- Edge (2, 7): Forms a triangle with vertices 1 and 4.  
- Edge (2, 9): Forms a triangle with vertices 6 and 0.  
- Edge (3, 1): No triangles formed.  
- Edge (3, 4): Forms a triangle with vertices 2 and 7.  
- Edge (3, 5): Forms a triangle with vertices 1 and 7.  
- Edge (3, 6): Forms a triangle with vertex 4.  
- Edge (4, 2): No triangles formed.  
- Edge (4, 3): Forms a triangle with vertices 1 and 7.  
- Edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle with vertices 0, 3, and 9.  
- Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with vertices 1 and 3.  
- Edge (5, 1): No triangles formed.  
- Edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.  
- Edge (5, 9): Forms a triangle with vertex 2.  
- Edge (6, 0): No triangles formed.  
- Edge (6, 3): Forms a triangle with vertices 4 and 7.  
- Edge (6, 4): Forms a triangle with vertices 0 and 7.  
- Edge (6, 7): Forms a triangle with vertices 3 and 4.  
- Edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.  
- Edge (7, 2): Forms a triangle with vertex 4.  
- Edge (7, 4): Forms a triangle with vertices 2 and 3.  
- Edge (7, 6): Forms a triangle with vertices 0 and 3.  
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.  
- Edge (7, 9): Forms a triangle with vertices 0, 2, and 6.  
- Edge (8, 7): No triangles formed.  
- Edge (9, 0): No triangles formed.  
- Edge (9, 2): Forms a triangle with vertices 7 and 5.  
- Edge (9, 5): No triangles formed.  
- Edge (9, 7): Forms a triangle with vertices 0 and 2.  

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13], and the unique triangles found are <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 2, 7>, <4, 3, 7>, <6, 3, 4>, <7, 0, 2>.
