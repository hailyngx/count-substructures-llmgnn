Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 5

Sorting the nodes based on their degrees, the new labels are:
- Node 0 (degree 2) is relabeled as Node 0
- Node 1 (degree 2) is relabeled as Node 1
- Node 6 (degree 2) is relabeled as Node 2
- Node 9 (degree 2) is relabeled as Node 3
- Node 7 (degree 3) is relabeled as Node 4
- Node 5 (degree 3) is relabeled as Node 5
- Node 8 (degree 3) is relabeled as Node 6
- Node 2 (degree 4) is relabeled as Node 7
- Node 3 (degree 4) is relabeled as Node 8
- Node 4 (degree 5) is relabeled as Node 9

Checking the edges with the lowest labeled node having fewer connections:
- Node 0 -> Node 6: No triangle
- Node 1 -> Node 4: No triangle
- Node 2 -> Node 3: No triangle
- Node 2 -> Node 7: No triangle
- Node 2 -> Node 8: Triangle <2, 3, 4>
- Node 3 -> Node 2: No triangle
- Node 3 -> Node 4: Triangle <2, 3, 4>
- Node 3 -> Node 7: No triangle
- Node 4 -> Node 1: No triangle
- Node 4 -> Node 3: Triangle <2, 3, 4>
- Node 4 -> Node 5: No triangle
- Node 4 -> Node 8: Triangle <2, 4, 8>
- Node 5 -> Node 4: No triangle
- Node 5 -> Node 9: No triangle
- Node 6 -> Node 0: No triangle
- Node 7 -> Node 2: No triangle
- Node 7 -> Node 3: No triangle
- Node 8 -> Node 2: Triangle <2, 3, 8>
- Node 8 -> Node 4: Triangle <2, 4, 8>
- Node 9 -> Node 5: No triangle

Count of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 8>
