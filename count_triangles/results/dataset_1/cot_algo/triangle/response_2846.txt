Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of vertices sorted by their degree:

Vertices degrees:  
0: 3  
1: 2  
2: 2  
3: 5  
4: 4  
5: 2  
7: 1  
8: 2  
9: 2  

Now, we will go through each edge and only consider the ones where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles:
(0, 3): Shares connection with 4. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
(0, 4): Shares connection with 3. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
(0, 7): No triangle
(1, 3): Shares connection with 4. Triangle <1, 3, 4>
(1, 8): No triangle
(2, 4): Shares connection with 3. Triangle <2, 3, 4>
(2, 8): No triangle
(3, 5): No triangle
(4, 9): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles: <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 4>
