Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
Following the instructions for the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection

Relabeling the vertices based on the degree-based ordering:

Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 7: 0 connections
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections

Now, we go through each edge starting from the lowest labeled vertex with fewer connections:

1. Check edge (0, 1): No triangle
2. Check edge (0, 3): Triangle formed with Vertex 4 <0, 3, 4>
3. Check edge (1, 6): No triangle
4. Check edge (2, 4): No triangle
5. Check edge (2, 6): Triangle formed with Vertex 4 <2, 4, 6>
6. Check edge (3, 4): Triangle formed with Vertex 0 <0, 3, 4>
7. Check edge (4, 5): No triangle
8. Check edge (4, 6): Triangle formed with Vertex 2 <2, 4, 6>
9. Check edge (6, 7): No triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [2]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 4> and <2, 4, 6>
