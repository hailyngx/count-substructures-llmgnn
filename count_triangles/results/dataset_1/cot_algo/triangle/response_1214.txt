Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). 

The sorted order of vertices based on their degrees is: 
1. Node 3 (Degree: 1)
2. Node 5 (Degree: 1)
3. Node 4 (Degree: 2)
4. Node 6 (Degree: 2)
5. Node 8 (Degree: 2)
6. Node 7 (Degree: 2)
7. Node 1 (Degree: 3)
8. Node 9 (Degree: 4)
9. Node 0 (Degree: 4)
10. Node 2 (Degree: 4)
