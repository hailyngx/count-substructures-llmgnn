Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has. Then, the vertices are relabeled accordingly. 

The sorted vertices are:
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 6 connections
Vertex 8: 7 connections

Following the method, we will go through each edge in the order of the vertices and count the triangles formed.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
