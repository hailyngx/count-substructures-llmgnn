Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 3 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 2 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 5 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 1 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 8 is connected to 5 nodes.
- Node 7 is connected to 5 nodes.
- Node 6 is connected to 5 nodes.

Now, by applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles formed by shared connections:

The total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <3, 8, 9>
- <6, 7, 8>
