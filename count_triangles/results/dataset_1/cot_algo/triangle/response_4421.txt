Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 9: 0 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections

Now, we'll relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 9 (0 connections) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 8 (1 connection) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 5 (2 connections) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 7 (2 connections) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 6 (2 connections) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 2 (3 connections) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 3 (2 connections) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 1 (4 connections) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 4 (4 connections) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 0 (4 connections) -> Vertex 9

Next, we'll consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Potential triangle: (5, 2) -> Vertex 2 (Vertex 5) has 3 connections
Triangle found: <2, 5, 1>

Potential triangle: (6, 1) -> Vertex 1 (Vertex 8) has 1 connection
Triangle found: <1, 4, 7>

Potential triangle: (6, 0) -> Vertex 0 (Vertex 9) has 0 connections
Triangle found: <0, 6, 4>

Potential triangle: (1, 6) -> Vertex 1 (Vertex 8) has 1 connection
Triangle found: <1, 4, 8>
Potential triangle: (1, 0) -> Vertex 0 (Vertex 9) has 0 connections

Potential triangle: (4, 7) -> Vertex 4 (Vertex 8) has 4 connections
Triangle found: <4, 7, 8>

The total number of triangles is [4].
