Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 0 - Degree 3  
Node 1 - Degree 1  
Node 9 - Degree 1  
Node 2 - Degree 3  
Node 7 - Degree 3  
Node 8 - Degree 2  
Node 4 - Degree 4  
Node 3 - Degree 5  
Node 5 - Degree 6  
Node 6 - Degree 5  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find that there are:
[5] triangles in total.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
