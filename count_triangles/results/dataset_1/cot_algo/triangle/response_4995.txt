Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph. 

After analyzing the connections based on the ordering of vertices, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
