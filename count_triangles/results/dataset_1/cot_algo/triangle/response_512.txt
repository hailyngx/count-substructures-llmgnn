Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 0
Node 0: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
We find triangles based on shared connections and count them:
1. <1, 5, 6>
2. <1, 5, 9>
3. <1, 6, 9>
4. <5, 2, 6>
5. <5, 2, 9>
6. <5, 6, 9>
7. <6, 3, 9>
8. <6, 8, 9>
9. <4, 0, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
