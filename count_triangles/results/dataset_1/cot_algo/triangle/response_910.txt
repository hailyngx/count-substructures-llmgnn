Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph with nodes and edges looks like this:
```
  0 -- 4 -- 1
  |    |    |
  5    0    3
       |    |
       6 -- 9 -- 2
       |    |    |
       7 -- 9    9
```

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Sort the vertices by the number of connections:
   Vertices: 2, 5
   Vertices: 1, 7
   Vertices: 0, 5
   Vertices: 6
   Vertices: 3
   Vertices: 4
   Vertices: 9

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   Vertex 2 -> 0
   Vertex 5 -> 1
   Vertex 1 -> 2
   Vertex 7 -> 3
   Vertex 0 -> 4
   Vertex 5 -> 5
   Vertex 6 -> 6
   Vertex 3 -> 7
   Vertex 4 -> 8
   Vertex 9 -> 9

3. Checking each edge:
   - Edge (0, 4): Both 0 and 4 have degree 2, so proceed. They share node 5, creating triangle <0, 4, 5>.
   - Edge (0, 5): Both 0 and 5 have degree 2, so proceed. They share node 4, creating triangle <0, 4, 5>.
   - Edge (1, 3): Both 1 and 3 have degree 2, so proceed. They share node 4, creating triangle <1, 3, 4>.
   - Edge (1, 4): Both 1 and 4 have degree 2, so proceed. They share node 0, creating triangle <1, 0, 4>.
   - Edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has smaller degree, proceed. They share no common node.
   - Edge (3, 1): Both 1 and 3 have degree 2, so proceed. They share node 4, creating triangle <3, 1, 4>.
   - Edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 has smaller degree, proceed. They share no common node.
   - Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 has smaller degree, proceed. They share no common node.
   - Edge (4, 0): Both 0 and 4 have degree 2, so proceed. They share node 5, creating triangle <0, 4, 5>.
   - Edge (4, 1): Both 1 and 4 have degree 2, so proceed. They share node 0, creating triangle <1, 0, 4>.
   - Edge (5, 0): Both 0 and 5 have degree 2, so proceed. They share node 4, creating triangle <5, 0, 4>.
   - Edge (6, 3): Vertex 3 has smaller degree, proceed. They share no common node.
   - Edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 has smaller degree, proceed. They share no common node.
   - Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 has smaller degree, proceed. They share no common node.
   - Edge (7, 6): Vertex 6 has smaller degree, proceed. They share no common node.
   - Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has smaller degree, proceed. They share no common node.
   - Edge (9, 2): Vertex 2 has smaller degree, proceed. They share no common node.
   - Edge (9, 3): Vertex 3 has smaller degree, proceed. They share no common node.
   - Edge (9, 6): Vertex 6 has smaller degree, proceed. They share no common node.
   - Edge (9, 7): Vertex 7 has smaller degree, proceed. They share no common node.

After checking all edges, we find a total of 4 unique triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <1, 0, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, and <5, 0, 4>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
