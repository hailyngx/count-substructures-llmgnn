Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows: 

Node 1 has 0 connections  
Node 3 has 1 connection  
Node 2 has 1 connection  
Node 5 has 2 connections  
Node 6 has 2 connections  
Node 9 has 2 connections  
Node 0 has 3 connections  
Node 4 has 5 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with counting the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2) does not form a triangle.
2. Edge (0, 4) does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (3, 1) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (4, 0) does not form a triangle.
8. Edge (4, 3) does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (4, 5) forms a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
10. Edge (4, 6) forms a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
11. Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.
12. Edge (5, 4) forms a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
13. Edge (5, 6) forms a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
14. Edge (6, 4) forms a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
15. Edge (6, 5) forms a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
16. Edge (9, 0) does not form a triangle.
17. Edge (9, 4) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 4, and the unique triangles found are <4, 5, 6>.
