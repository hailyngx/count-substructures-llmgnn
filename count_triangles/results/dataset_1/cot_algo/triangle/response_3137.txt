Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 9, 3 connections
- Node 1, 2 connections
- Node 6, 1 connection
- Node 2, 2 connections
- Node 7, 3 connections
- Node 5, 3 connections
- Node 3, 3 connections
- Node 8, 4 connections
- Node 4, 5 connections
- Node 0, 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- For the edge (0, 4): Node 0 has 5 connections, Node 4 has 5 connections. Both have the same number of connections, so we proceed.
- Shared connections between 0 and 4: 8
- For the edge (0, 5): Node 0 has 5 connections, Node 5 has 3 connections. We proceed as Node 5 has fewer connections.
- Shared connections between 0 and 5: None
- For the edge (0, 7): Node 0 has 5 connections, Node 7 has 3 connections. We proceed as Node 7 has fewer connections.
- Shared connections between 0 and 7: 8
- For the edge (0, 8): Node 0 has 5 connections, Node 8 has 4 connections. We proceed as Node 8 has fewer connections.
- Shared connections between 0 and 8: 4
- For the edge (0, 9): Node 0 has 5 connections, Node 9 has 3 connections. We proceed as Node 9 has fewer connections.
- Shared connections between 0 and 9: None
- For the edge (1, 4): Node 1 has 2 connections, Node 4 has 5 connections. We proceed as Node 1 has fewer connections.
- Shared connections between 1 and 4: None
- For the edge (1, 9): Node 1 has 2 connections, Node 9 has 3 connections. We proceed as Node 1 has fewer connections.
- Shared connections between 1 and 9: None
- For the edge (2, 3): Node 2 has 2 connections, Node 3 has 3 connections. We proceed as Node 2 has fewer connections.
- Shared connections between 2 and 3: None
- For the edge (2, 4): Node 2 has 2 connections, Node 4 has 5 connections. We proceed as Node 2 has fewer connections.
- Shared connections between 2 and 4: None
- For the edge (3, 8): Node 3 has 3 connections, Node 8 has 4 connections. We proceed as Node 3 has fewer connections.
- Shared connections between 3 and 8: None
- For the edge (3, 5): Node 3 has 3 connections, Node 5 has 3 connections. Both have the same number of connections, so we proceed.
- Shared connections between 3 and 5: 0
