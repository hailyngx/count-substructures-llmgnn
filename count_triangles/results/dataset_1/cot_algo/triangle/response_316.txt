Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices:  
2 connections: 1, 4  
3 connections: 2, 5, 8  
4 connections: 3, 7  
6 connections: 6, 9  
8 connections: 0  

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:  
1 → 0, 4 → 1  
2 → 2, 5 → 3, 8 → 4  
3 → 5, 7 → 6  
6 → 7, 9 → 8  
0 → 9  

Now, we go through each edge and check for shared connections:

Edges with both vertices labeled:  
(0, 3) → Check for shared connections:  (0, 3, 5) is a triangle  
(0, 6) → Check for shared connections:  (0, 6, 4) is a triangle  
(0, 4) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(0, 8) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(0, 5) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(1, 7) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(2, 3) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(3, 7) → Check for shared connections:  (3, 7, 9) is a triangle  
(3, 5) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(4, 7) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(5, 4) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(6, 7) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(6, 1) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(6, 4) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(6, 8) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(7, 8) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(7, 9) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(8, 9) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(9, 8) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  
(9, 5) → Check for shared connections: No triangle  

Thus, we have found 2 unique triangles:  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 6, 4>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
