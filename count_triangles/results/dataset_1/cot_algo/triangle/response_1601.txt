Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order: 
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections 
Vertex 3: 6 connections

2. Relabel the vertices: 
Vertex 1 -> 0
Vertex 7 -> 1
Vertex 0 -> 2
Vertex 5 -> 3
Vertex 8 -> 4
Vertex 2 -> 5
Vertex 4 -> 6
Vertex 6 -> 7
Vertex 9 -> 8
Vertex 3 -> 9

3. Analyze the edges based on the vertex labels:
- (0, 3) forms triangle with 6
- (0, 9) forms triangle with 8
- (1, 9) forms no triangle
- (2, 3) forms no triangle
- (2, 6) forms no triangle
- (3, 6) forms triangle with 5
- (3, 4) forms no triangle
- (3, 6) forms triangle with 5
- (3, 8) forms triangle with 4
- (3, 9) forms triangle with 0, 4
- (4, 9) forms no triangle
- (5, 6) forms no triangle
- (5, 7) forms no triangle
- (6, 6) forms no triangle
- (7, 5) forms no triangle
- (8, 3) forms no triangle
- (8, 9) forms triangle with 0
- (9, 0) forms triangle with 3
- (9, 1) forms no triangle
- (9, 3) forms triangle with 0, 4
- (9, 4) forms no triangle

4. Counting the triangles and listing the unique triangles:
[6] total triangles
<0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <3, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 3, 9>
