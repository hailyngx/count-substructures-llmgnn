Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph.

Number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0: 5 connections
- Vertex 1: 6 connections
- Vertex 2: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 5 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 5 connections
- Vertex 9: 5 connections

Vertices sorted by number of connections in ascending order:
- Vertex 7 (1 connection)
- Vertex 2 (3 connections)
- Vertex 6 (3 connections)
- Vertex 5 (4 connections)
- Vertex 0 (5 connections)
- Vertex 4 (5 connections)
- Vertex 8 (5 connections)
- Vertex 9 (5 connections)
- Vertex 1 (6 connections)

Triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Total number of triangles: [7]
- Unique triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 9>
