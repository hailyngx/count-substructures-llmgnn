Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each vertex has:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 5 connections
- Vertex 3: 5 connections
- Vertex 4: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 5 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 0 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 1 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 2 (5 connections) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 3 (5 connections) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 4 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 5 (4 connections) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 6 (5 connections) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 7 (5 connections) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 8 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 9 (5 connections) becomes Vertex 9

Now, let's count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 6>]

Total number of triangles: [10]
