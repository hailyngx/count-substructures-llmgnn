Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
```
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we consider the edges in the following order:
1. (0, 3) - Both vertices have 3 connections each, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 2
2. (0, 5) - Both vertices have 3 connections each, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 1
3. (0, 9) - Vertex 0 has 3 connections which is fewer than vertex 9's 5 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 1
4. (1, 2) - Both vertices have 5 connections each, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 1
5. (2, 3) - Both vertices have 5 connections each, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 2
6. (2, 4) - Both vertices have 5 connections each, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 1
7. (2, 6) - Both vertices have 5 connections each, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 1
8. (2, 9) - Vertex 2 has 5 connections which is fewer than vertex 9's 5 connections, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 1
9. (3, 5) - Both vertices have 3 connections each, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 1
10. (3, 8) - Vertex 3 has 5 connections which is fewer than vertex 8's 3 connections, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections: 1
11. (4, 7) - Both vertices have 3 connections each, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections: 1
12. (4, 8) - Both vertices have 4 connections each, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections: 1
13. (5, 6) - Both vertices have 3 connections each, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections: 1
14. (6, 9) - Vertex 6 has 5 connections which is fewer than vertex 9's 5 connections, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections: 1
15. (8, 9) - Both vertices have 3 connections each, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections: 1

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [15], and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <3, 8, 9>.
