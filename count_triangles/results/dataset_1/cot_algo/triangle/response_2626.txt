Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 0: 6 connections
- Node 2: 6 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles formed in the graph:

- For edge (0, 1): No triangle formed
- For edge (0, 2): No triangle formed
- For edge (0, 4): No triangle formed
- For edge (0, 6): Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- For edge (0, 8): No triangle formed
- For edge (0, 9): Triangle <0, 2, 9>
- For edge (1, 2): No triangle formed
- For edge (1, 3): No triangle formed
- For edge (1, 5): No triangle formed
- For edge (2, 3): No triangle formed
- For edge (2, 7): No triangle formed
- For edge (2, 8): No triangle formed
- For edge (2, 9): No triangle formed
- For edge (3, 6): No triangle formed
- For edge (3, 7): No triangle formed
- For edge (4, 0): No triangle formed
- For edge (5, 6): No triangle formed
- For edge (5, 7): No triangle formed
- For edge (5, 9): Triangle <5, 0, 9>
- For edge (6, 7): No triangle formed
- For edge (7, 5): No triangle formed
- For edge (8, 0): No triangle formed
- For edge (8, 9): No triangle formed
- For edge (9, 5): Triangle <9, 0, 2>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <5, 0, 9>
