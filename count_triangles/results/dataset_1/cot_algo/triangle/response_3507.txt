Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 0 has 5 connections
- Vertex 3 has 3 connections
- Vertex 1 has 3 connections
- Vertex 4 has 4 connections
- Vertex 5 has 3 connections
- Vertex 6 has 3 connections
- Vertex 7 has 4 connections
- Vertex 2 has 3 connections
- Vertex 8 has 2 connections
- Vertex 9 has 1 connection

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 4, 5>
4. <0, 4, 6>
5. <0, 6, 7>
6. <1, 4, 7>

Counting the total number of triangles gives us the final answer as [6].
