Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 1, 5, 8, 9, 2, 4, 6, 7, 0, 3.

The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, and <4, 8, 9>.

The total number of triangles is [5].
