Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective degrees are:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 1
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 8

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Start with the edge (0, 2): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 2, and vertex 0 and 2 are connected. Count this triangle. (0, 2, 4)
2. Move to the edge (0, 4): Proceed as vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 4. Count this triangle. (0, 2, 4)
3. Move to the edge (1, 6): Proceed as vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 6; no triangles are formed.
4. Move to the edge (2, 3): Proceed as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 3. No triangles are formed.
5. Move to the edge (2, 5): Proceed as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 5. No triangles are formed.
6. Move to the edge (2, 6): Proceed as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 6. No triangles are formed.
7. Move to the edge (2, 7): Proceed as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 7. No triangles are formed.
8. Move to the edge (2, 9): Proceed as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 9. Count this triangle. (2, 7, 9)
9. Move to the edge (3, 2): Proceed as vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 2. No triangles are formed.
10. Move to the edge (3, 8): Proceed as vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 8; no triangles are formed.
11. Move to the edge (4, 0): Proceed as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 0; no triangles are formed.
12. Move to the edge (4, 5): Proceed as vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 5. Count this triangle. (0, 2, 4)
13. Move to the edge (4, 6): Proceed as vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 6. Count this triangle. (1, 6, 4)
14. Move to the edge (5, 2): Proceed as vertex 5 has fewer connections than vertex 2. Count this triangle. (0, 2, 5)
15. Move to the edge (5, 4): Proceed as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 4. No triangles are formed.
16. Move to the edge (5, 8): Proceed as vertex 5 has fewer connections than vertex 8. Count this triangle. (0, 4, 5)
17. Move to the edge (5, 9): Proceed as vertex 5 has fewer connections than vertex 9. Count this triangle. (2, 4, 5)
18. Move to the edge (6, 1): Proceed as vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 1; no triangles are formed.
19. Move to the edge (6, 2): Proceed as vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 2; no triangles are formed.
20. Move to the edge (6, 4): Proceed as vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 4; no triangles are formed.
21. Move to the edge (7, 2): Proceed as vertex 7 has fewer connections than vertex 2. Count this triangle. (2, 7, 9)
22. Move to the edge (7, 9): Proceed as vertex 7 has fewer connections than vertex 9; no triangles are formed.
23. Move to the edge (8, 3): Proceed as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 3. No triangles are formed.
24. Move to the edge (8, 5): Proceed as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 5. No triangles are formed.
25. Move to the edge (9, 2): Proceed as vertex 9 has fewer connections than vertex 2. Count this triangle. (2, 7, 9)
26. Move to the edge (9, 5): Proceed as vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 5. No triangles are formed.
27. Move to the edge (9, 7): Proceed as vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 7; no triangles are formed.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is: [6]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 7, 9>.
