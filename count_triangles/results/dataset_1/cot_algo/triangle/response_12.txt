Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. 
Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their number of connections:
Vertex 6: 0 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections

Examining each edge while considering the lower labeled vertex as specified:
For edge (0, 2), both 0 and 2 share a connection with vertex 4. 
For edge (0, 4), both 0 and 4 share a connection with vertex 2. 
For edge (0, 9), both 0 and 9 share connections with vertex 1. 
For edge (1, 7), both 1 and 7 share connections with vertex 5. 
For edge (1, 8), both 1 and 8 share a connection with vertex 2. 

These connections form the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 8>

There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph.
The total number of triangles is [4].
