Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 0 has 2 connections
Node 7 has 2 connections
Node 9 has 2 connections
Node 6 has 2 connections
Node 5 has 3 connections
Node 1 has 5 connections
Node 3 has 5 connections
Node 8 has 5 connections
Node 2 has 6 connections
Node 4 has 6 connections

After relabeling the nodes, the new list is:
Label 0: Nodes 0, 7, 9, 6
Label 1: Node 5
Label 2: Node 1
Label 3: Nodes 3, 8
Label 4: Nodes 2, 4

Now, let's count the triangles:
- For edge (0, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (0, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (1, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 3> is formed.
- For edge (1, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (1, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (1, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (1, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (2, 1): Triangle <1, 2, 3> is already counted.
- For edge (2, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (2, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (2, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (2, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (3, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (3, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (3, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (4, 0): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (4, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (4, 5): Triangle <1, 4, 5> is formed.
- For edge (4, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (4, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (5, 0): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (5, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (5, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 5> is already counted.
- For edge (5, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (6, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (6, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (7, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (7, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (8, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (8, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (8, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (8, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (9, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (9, 8): No triangles can be formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 4, 5>
