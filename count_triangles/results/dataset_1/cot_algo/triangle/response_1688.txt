Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertex 1: 8 connections
Vertex 6: 6 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 0 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order: (4, 0), (4, 5), (8, 9), (9, 7), (7, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (9, 8), (7, 9), (2, 5), (5, 4), (0, 4), (9, 4), (7, 4), (6, 1), (4, 7), (6, 7), (5, 2), (2, 1), (4, 9).

By checking for shared connections for each edge, we find that the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<8, 9, 4>
