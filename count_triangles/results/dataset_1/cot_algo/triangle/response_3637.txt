Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Node 0 has 1 connection.
Node 2 has 1 connection.
Node 6 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.
Node 1 has 6 connections.
Node 3 has 6 connections.
Node 9 has 7 connections.

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 0 -> Node A
Node 2 -> Node B
Node 6 -> Node C
Node 8 -> Node D
Node 7 -> Node E
Node 5 -> Node F
Node 4 -> Node G
Node 1 -> Node H
Node 3 -> Node I
Node 9 -> Node J

Let's start counting the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Node A (0) and Node I (3): No triangles.
2. Node B (2) and Node J (9): No triangles.
3. Node C (6) and Node G (4): <4, 5, 6>
4. Node C (6) and Node F (5): <5, 6, 7>
5. Node D (8) and Node G (4): <4, 7, 8>
6. Node D (8) and Node E (7): <7, 8, 9>
7. Node E (7) and Node F (5): <5, 7, 9>
8. Node G (4) and Node F (5): <4, 6, 5>
9. Node G (4) and Node I (3): No triangles.
10. Node G (4) and Node J (9): <4, 8, 9>
11. Node H (1) and Node I (3): No triangles.
12. Node H (1) and Node G (4): <1, 4, 9>
13. Node H (1) and Node J (9): <1, 9, 2>
14. Node I (3) and Node J (9): <3, 9, 7>

Total number of triangles: [9]
