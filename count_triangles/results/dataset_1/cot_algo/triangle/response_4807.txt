Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are: 
Node 3 (Degree 2)
Node 5 (Degree 2)
Node 8 (Degree 2)
Node 9 (Degree 2)
Node 1 (Degree 4)
Node 7 (Degree 4)
Node 2 (Degree 5)
Node 6 (Degree 5)
Node 0 (Degree 6)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles by checking for shared connections:

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 6, 8>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <1, 2, 6>
5. <1, 6, 7>
6. <1, 2, 7>
7. <2, 6, 7>
8. <6, 7, 8>
9. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
