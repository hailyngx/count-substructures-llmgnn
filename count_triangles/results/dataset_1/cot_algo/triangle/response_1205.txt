Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following list: 

Vertices: 
8 (1 connection)  
9 (2 connections)  
1 (2 connections)  
3 (1 connection)  
4 (3 connections)  
5 (3 connections)  
0 (4 connections)  
2 (4 connections)  
6 (5 connections)  
7 (6 connections)  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles with edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 7> (shared connection: 0)
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 4> (shared connection: 4)
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 6> (shared connection: 5)
- Triangle 4: <0, 5, 7> (shared connection: 0, 7)
- Triangle 5: <0, 7, 9> (shared connection: 9)
- Triangle 6: <2, 7, 9> (shared connection: 9)
- Triangle 7: <4, 5, 6> (shared connection: 5)
- Triangle 8: <4, 6, 7> (shared connection: 6)
- Triangle 9: <5, 6, 7> (shared connection: 6)
- Triangle 10: <6, 7, 9> (shared connection: 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
