Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method starts by sorting the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes: 3 6 9 1 9 4 7 1 4 2

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees, we get the following list:

Nodes: 3 6 9 1 9 4 7 1 4 2
Labels: 
3 -> 0
6 -> 1
9 -> 2
1 -> 3
9 -> 4
4 -> 5
7 -> 6
1 -> 7
4 -> 8
2 -> 9

Now, we will look only at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Edges to consider based on the above rule:
(3, 4)
(6, 2)
(9, 7)
(9, 7)
(1, 7)
(4, 8)
(1, 5)
(4, 8)
(2, 7)

Now, we will check for common connections between the vertices of each edge to find triangles:
<3, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<4, 8, 7>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
