Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's follow the steps to calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

### Step 1: Sort vertices by their number of connections
- Vertex 6: 0 connections
- Vertices 7 and 9: 1 connection each
- Vertices 1 and 5: 2 connections each
- Vertices 2 and 7: 3 connections each
- Vertices 0 and 9: 4 connections each
- Vertex 4: 5 connections
- Vertex 8: 6 connections
- Vertex 3: 7 connections

### Step 2: Relabel the vertices
- Vertex 6: 0 connections → Label 0
- Vertices 7 and 9: 1 connection each → Label 1 and 2
- Vertices 1 and 5: 2 connections each → Label 3 and 4
- Vertices 2 and 7: 3 connections each → Label 5 and 6
- Vertices 0 and 9: 4 connections each → Label 7 and 8
- Vertex 4: 5 connections → Label 9
- Vertex 8: 6 connections → Label 10
- Vertex 3: 7 connections → Label 11

### Step 3: Count triangles
- For each edge, only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
- Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

### Triangles found:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 5, 2>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 8, 0>
- <2, 1, 8>
- <2, 5, 4>
- <3, 4, 0>
- <4, 0, 5>
- <4, 5, 2>
- <4, 5, 0>
- <4, 8, 0>
- <5, 0, 2>

### Total number of triangles: [15]
