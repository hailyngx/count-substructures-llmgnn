Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Let's label the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 3 has 1 connection.
Vertex 1 has 1 connection.
Vertices 4, 5, 6 have 0 connections (in ascending order).
Vertices 7 and 0 have 3 connections.
Vertices 2 and 9 have 4 connections.
Vertices 8 has 5 connections.

Now, we will go through the edges according to the method described earlier:

1. Edge (0, 2): Both vertices have 3 connections, but 0 has a lower label. Checking shared connections gives triangle <0, 2, 8>.
2. Edge (0, 5): Vertex 5 has 0 connections and is the lower label. No triangles formed.
3. Edge (0, 8): Both have 3 connections, but 0 has a lower label. Checking shared connections gives triangle <0, 2, 8>.
4. Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has 1 connection and is the lower label. No triangles formed.
5. Edge (2, 0): Already counted above.
6. Edge (2, 1): Already counted above.
7. Edge (3, 6): Vertices 3 and 6 have 1 connection each, with 3 being the lower label. No triangles formed.
8. Edge (4, 9): Vertices 4 and 9 have 0 connections each, with 4 being the lower label. No triangles formed.
9. Edge (5, 0): Already counted above.
10. Edge (6, 3): Already counted above.
11. Edge (8, 0): Already counted above.
12. Edge (8, 9): Vertices have 3 and 4 connections, with 9 being the lower label. No triangles formed.
13. Edge (9, 4): Already counted above.
14. Edge (9, 8): Already counted above.

The total number of triangles is [2], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>.
