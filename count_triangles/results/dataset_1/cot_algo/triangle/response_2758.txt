Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 6 (degree 0)
- Node 8 (degree 0)
- Node 0 (degree 4)
- Node 4 (degree 4)
- Node 7 (degree 4)
- Node 1 (degree 5)
- Node 2 (degree 5)
- Node 3 (degree 5)
- Node 5 (degree 5)
- Node 9 (degree 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles based on the shared connections between vertices with lower labels.

Calculating the triangles yields:
- Triangles: 9

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9]. 

Unique triangles found are:
- <0, 5, 1>
- <0, 5, 3>
- <0, 9, 1>
- <0, 9, 2>
- <0, 9, 3>
- <1, 5, 3>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 3, 5>
- <1, 5, 9>
