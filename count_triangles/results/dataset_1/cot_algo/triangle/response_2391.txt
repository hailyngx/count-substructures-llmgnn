Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, we get the following order: 0, 1, 7, 9, 3, 6, 5, 8, 2, 4.

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges:

1. Edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle with edge (4, 2) and edge (2, 0) forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 6): Does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 2): Does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 8): Does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (1, 9): Does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 1): Does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (2, 3): Forms a triangle with edge (3, 4) and edge (4, 2) forming triangle <2, 3, 4>.
8. Edge (2, 4): Already counted in triangle 1.
9. Edge (3, 2): Already counted in triangle 7.
10. Edge (3, 4): Already counted in triangle 7.
11. Edge (4, 0): Already counted in triangle 1.
12. Edge (4, 2): Already counted in triangles 1 and 7.
13. Edge (4, 3): Already counted in triangle 7.
14. Edge (4, 5): Forms a triangle with edge (5, 0) and edge (0, 4) forming triangle <0, 4, 5>.
15. Edge (4, 6): Does not form a triangle.
16. Edge (4, 8): Does not form a triangle.
17. Edge (5, 4): Already counted in triangle 14.
18. Edge (5, 6): Does not form a triangle.
19. Edge (5, 7): Does not form a triangle.
20. Edge (5, 8): Does not form a triangle.
21. Edge (5, 9): Does not form a triangle.
22. Edge (6, 0): Does not form a triangle.
23. Edge (6, 4): Does not form a triangle.
24. Edge (6, 5): Does not form a triangle.
25. Edge (6, 7): Does not form a triangle.
26. Edge (7, 5): Does not form a triangle.
27. Edge (7, 6): Does not form a triangle.
28. Edge (7, 8): Does not form a triangle.
29. Edge (8, 1): Does not form a triangle.
30. Edge (8, 4): Does not form a triangle.
31. Edge (8, 5): Does not form a triangle.
32. Edge (8, 7): Does not form a triangle.
33. Edge (9, 1): Does not form a triangle.
34. Edge (9, 5): Does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4> and <0, 4, 5>.
