Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

In this case, the number of connections for each node is as follows:
- Node 4: 0 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 9: 1 connection
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections

The relabeled graph based on the degree-based ordering is as follows:
- Node 4 (0 connections) -> Node A
- Node 1 (1 connection) -> Node B
- Node 5 (1 connection) -> Node C
- Node 9 (1 connection) -> Node D
- Node 6 (2 connections) -> Node E
- Node 2 (2 connections) -> Node F
- Node 8 (4 connections) -> Node G
- Node 3 (4 connections) -> Node H
- Node 0 (5 connections) -> Node I
- Node 7 (5 connections) -> Node J

Next, we will iterate through each edge and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge (A, B): No triangles
2. Edge (A, D): No triangles
3. Edge (A, J): No triangles
4. Edge (A, G): No triangles
5. Edge (B, A): No triangles
6. Edge (F, G): No triangles
7. Edge (F, D): No triangles
8. Edge (H, A): No triangles
9. Edge (H, C): No triangles
10. Edge (H, J): No triangles
11. Edge (C, H): No triangles
12. Edge (E, J): No triangles
13. Edge (E, G): No triangles
14. Edge (J, A): No triangles
15. Edge (J, H): Forms triangle <J, I, H>
16. Edge (J, E): No triangles
17. Edge (J, G): Forms triangle <J, I, G>
18. Edge (J, D): No triangles
19. Edge (G, A): No triangles
20. Edge (G, F): No triangles
21. Edge (G, E): No triangles
22. Edge (G, J): Forms triangle <G, I, J>
23. Edge (D, F): No triangles
24. Edge (D, J): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <J, I, H>, <J, I, G>, and <G, I, J>.
