Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we have the following labels and connections:
- Node 4: Degree 0, Connections: None
- Node 9: Degree 1, Connections: 1
- Node 5: Degree 2, Connections: 2, 7
- Node 6: Degree 2, Connections: 0, 2
- Node 1: Degree 2, Connections: 3, 9
- Node 2: Degree 3, Connections: 5, 6, 8
- Node 7: Degree 3, Connections: 3, 5, 8
- Node 0: Degree 3, Connections: 6, 8, 2
- Node 3: Degree 4, Connections: 1, 7, 8
- Node 8: Degree 4, Connections: 0, 2, 3

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (0, 6) and (6, 0) gives the triangle <0, 2, 6>.
2. Edge (0, 8) and (8, 0) gives the triangle <0, 2, 8>.
3. Edge (0, 8) and (8, 2) gives the triangle <0, 2, 8>.
4. Edge (1, 3) and (3, 1) gives the triangle <1, 2, 3>.
5. Edge (1, 9) and (9, 1) gives the triangle <1, 2, 9>.
6. Edge (2, 5) and (5, 2) gives the triangle <2, 5, 7>.
7. Edge (2, 5) and (5, 7) gives the triangle <2, 5, 7>.
8. Edge (2, 6) and (6, 2) gives the triangle <0, 2, 6>.
9. Edge (2, 6) and (6, 2) gives the triangle <0, 2, 8>.
10. Edge (2, 6) and (6, 0) gives the triangle <0, 2, 6>.
11. Edge (2, 6) and (6, 0) gives the triangle <0, 2, 8>.
12. Edge (2, 8) and (8, 0) gives the triangle <0, 2, 8>.
13. Edge (2, 8) and (8, 2) gives the triangle <0, 2, 8>.
14. Edge (2, 8) and (8, 3) gives the triangle <2, 3, 8>.
15. Edge (3, 1) and (1, 9) does not form a triangle due to vertex ordering.
16. Edge (3, 1) and (1, 3) gives the triangle <1, 2, 3>.
17. Edge (3, 7) and (7, 3) gives the triangle <2, 3, 7>.
18. Edge (3, 8) and (8, 0) gives the triangle <0, 2, 8>.
19. Edge (3, 8) and (8, 2) gives the triangle <2, 3, 8>.
20. Edge (5, 2) and (2, 6) does not form a triangle due to vertex ordering.
21. Edge (5, 2) and (2, 8) gives the triangle <2, 5, 8>.
22. Edge (5, 7) and (7, 3) gives the triangle <2, 3, 7>.
23. Edge (6, 2) and (2, 5) gives the triangle <2, 5, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13].
