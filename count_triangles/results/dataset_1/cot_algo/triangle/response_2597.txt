Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 0 (1 connection) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 4 (1 connection) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 2 (2 connections) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 8 (2 connections) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 3 (3 connections) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 5 (3 connections) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 9 (3 connections) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 7 (4 connections) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 6 (4 connections) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 1 (5 connections) -> Vertex 9

Checking the given edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections, we have the following triangles:
- <0, 3, 6>
- <1, 5, 2>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <1, 7, 4>
- <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
