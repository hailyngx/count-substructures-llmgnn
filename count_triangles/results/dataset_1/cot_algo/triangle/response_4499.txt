Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective degrees are:
(2) - 1
(5) - 1
(8) - 1
(0) - 3
(1) - 3
(3) - 3
(6) - 3
(9) - 3
(4) - 5
(7) - 7

The edges to consider based on degree-based ordering are:
(2, 4)
(2, 7)
(5, 4)
(5, 7)
(8, 4)
(8, 6)
(0, 1)
(0, 7)
(0, 9)
(1, 7)
(1, 9)
(3, 4)
(3, 6)
(3, 7)
(6, 7)
(6, 8)
(9, 2)

There are a total of [12] triangles in the graph. 
The unique triangles are:
<3, 4, 7>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<5, 4, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 3>
<3, 6, 7>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 7, 1>
<1, 9, 2>
<8, 6, 7>
