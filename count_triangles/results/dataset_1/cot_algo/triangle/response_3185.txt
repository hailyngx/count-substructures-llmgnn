Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertex 1: 0 connections
Vertex 10: 0 connections
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections

We will now relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 1 (0 connections) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 10 (0 connections) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 3 (1 connection) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 5 (2 connections) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 9 (2 connections) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 4 (3 connections) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 6 (3 connections) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 8 (3 connections) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 2 (4 connections) -> Vertex 9
Vertex 7 (4 connections) -> Vertex 10

Next, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
(2, 4) - Vertex 1 shares 0 connections with Vertex 3 and Vertex 5.
(2, 7) - Vertex 1 shares 0 connections with Vertex 10 and Vertex 6.
(2, 9) - Vertex 1 shares 0 connections with Vertex 4 and Vertex 8.
(3, 5) - Vertex 3 shares 0 connections with Vertex 5.
(4, 2) - Skipped as Vertex 1 has fewer connections than Vertex 9.
(4, 7) - Vertex 6 shares 0 connections with Vertex 10.
(5, 3) - Skipped as Vertex 3 has fewer connections than Vertex 5.
(5, 8) - Vertex 4 shares 0 connections with Vertex 8.
(6, 7) - Vertex 6 shares 0 connections with Vertex 10.
(6, 8) - Vertex 6 shares 0 connections with Vertex 10.
(7, 2) - Skipped as Vertex 1 has fewer connections than Vertex 10.
(7, 4) - Skipped as Vertex 6 has fewer connections than Vertex 8.
(7, 6) - Vertex 6 shares 0 connections with Vertex 10.
(8, 5) - Vertex 4 shares 0 connections with Vertex 8.
(8, 6) - Vertex 6 shares 0 connections with Vertex 10.
(8, 9) - Vertex 5 shares 0 connections with Vertex 4.
(9, 2) - Skipped as Vertex 1 has fewer connections than Vertex 5.
(9, 8) - Vertex 5 shares 0 connections with Vertex 4.
