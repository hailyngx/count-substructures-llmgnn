Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us to count the number of triangles efficiently.

First, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 1 3 5 8
Degrees: 2 1 1 1

Then, we re-label the vertices accordingly:
Vertices: 3 5 8 1
Degrees: 1 1 1 2

Now, we go through the edges keeping in mind to only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(1, 2) - Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 2
(1, 4) - Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 4
(5, 7) - Vertex 5 has fewer connections than vertex 7
(3, 4) - Vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 4

Now, counting the triangles formed by the shared connections:
<1, 2, 4> - Triangle formed by vertices 1, 2, and 4

Finally, we output the total number of triangles and the unique triangles found:
Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 4>
