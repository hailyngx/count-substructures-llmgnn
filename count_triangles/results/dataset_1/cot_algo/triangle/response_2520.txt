Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:  
Node 5 has 2 connections.  
Node 1 has 1 connection.  
Nodes 3 and 4 have 3 connections each.  
Nodes 0, 7, and 9 have 4 connections each.  
Node 8 has 5 connections.  
Node 2 has 6 connections.  
Now, we will find the triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with node 0 are 3, 5, 6, 8. So, triangle <0, 2, 3> is found.
2. Edge (0, 3): Shared connections with node 0 are 2, 4, 5. So, triangle <0, 3, 4> is found.
3. Edge (0, 4): Shared connections with node 0 are 3. So, triangle <0, 4, 3> is found.
4. Edge (0, 5): No triangles are formed.
5. Edge (0, 6): No triangles are formed.
6. Edge (0, 8): No triangles are formed.
7. Edge (1, 4): No triangles are formed.
8. Edge (2, 3): Shared connections with node 2 are 0, 5. So, triangle <2, 3, 0> is found.
9. Edge (2, 5): Shared connections with node 2 are 0. So, triangle <2, 5, 0> is found.
10. Edge (2, 7): No triangles are formed.
11. Edge (2, 9): No triangles are formed.
12. Edge (3, 4): Shared connections with node 3 are 0. So, triangle <3, 4, 0> is found.
13. Edge (4, 6): No triangles are formed.
14. Edge (4, 8): No triangles are formed.
15. Edge (5, 9): No triangles are formed.
16. Edge (6, 7): No triangles are formed.
17. Edge (6, 8): No triangles are formed.
18. Edge (6, 9): No triangles are formed.
19. Edge (7, 8): No triangles are formed.
20. Edge (7, 9): No triangles are formed.
21. Edge (8, 9): No triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
