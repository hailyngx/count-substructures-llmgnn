Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0 with 3 connections
- Vertex 1 with 2 connections
- Vertex 7 with 1 connection
- Vertex 3 with 3 connections
- Vertex 4 with 2 connections
- Vertex 5 with 5 connections
- Vertex 6 with 4 connections
- Vertex 2 with 5 connections
- Vertex 8 with 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check each edge to find triangles:
- Edge (0, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection at vertex 2. Triangle: <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection at vertex 2. Triangle: <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection at vertex 2. Triangle: <3, 2, 5>
- Edge (3, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection at vertex 2. Triangle: <3, 2, 6>
- Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection at vertex 2. Triangle: <3, 2, 8>
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <3, 2, 5>, and <3, 2, 8>.
