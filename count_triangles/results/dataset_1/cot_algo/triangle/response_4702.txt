Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes in ascending order of degrees:  
Node 4: degree 1  
Node 1: degree 1  
Node 2: degree 1  
Node 7: degree 2  
Node 9: degree 2  
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 6  

Now, counting the number of triangles:

1. For edge (0, 3):  
- Node 0 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 3 (degree 6).  
- Shared connections between 0 and 3: 7.  
- Triangle found: <0, 3, 7>.

2. For edge (0, 7):  
- Node 0 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 7 (degree 2).  
- No triangle formed with this edge.

3. For edge (1, 6):  
- Node 1 (degree 1) has fewer connections than Node 6 (degree 4).  
- No triangle formed with this edge.

4. For edge (2, 6):  
- Node 2 (degree 1) has fewer connections than Node 6 (degree 4).  
- No triangle formed with this edge.

5. For edge (3, 0):  
- Node 0 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Node 3 (degree 6).  
- Shared connections between 3 and 0: 7.  
- Triangle found: <3, 0, 7>.

6. For edge (3, 5):  
- Node 3 (degree 6) has more connections than Node 5 (degree 4), so we skip this edge.

7. For edge (3, 6):  
- Node 3 (degree 6) has more connections than Node 6 (degree 4), so we skip this edge.

8. For edge (3, 7):  
- Node 3 (degree 6) has more connections than Node 7 (degree 2), so we skip this edge.

9. For edge (3, 8):  
- Node 3 (degree 6) has more connections than Node 8 (degree 3), so we skip this edge.

10. For edge (4, 5):  
- Node 4 (degree 1) has fewer connections than Node 5 (degree 4).  
- No triangle formed with this edge.

11. For edge (5, 3):  
- Node 3 (degree 6) has more connections than Node 5 (degree 4), so we skip this edge.

12. For edge (5, 4):  
- Node 4 (degree 1) has fewer connections than Node 5 (degree 4).  
- No triangle formed with this edge.

13. For edge (5, 8):  
- Node 5 (degree 4) has more connections than Node 8 (degree 3), so we skip this edge.

14. For edge (6, 1):  
- Node 1 (degree 1) has fewer connections than Node 6 (degree 4).  
- No triangle formed with this edge.

15. For edge (6, 2):  
- Node 2 (degree 1) has fewer connections than Node 6 (degree 4).  
- No triangle formed with this edge.

16. For edge (6, 3):  
- Node 3 (degree 6) has more connections than Node 6 (degree 4), so we skip this edge.

17. For edge (6, 9):  
- Node 6 (degree 4) has more connections than Node 9 (degree 2), so we skip this edge.

18. For edge (7, 0):  
- Node 7 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 0 (degree 3).  
- No triangle formed with this edge.

19. For edge (7, 3):  
- Node 3 (degree 6) has more connections than Node 7 (degree 2), so we skip this edge.

20. For edge (8, 3):  
- Node 3 (degree 6) has more connections than Node 8 (degree 3), so we skip this edge.

21. For edge (8, 5):  
- Node 5 (degree 4) has more connections than Node 8 (degree 3), so we skip this edge.

22. For edge (8, 9):  
- Node 8 (degree 3) has more connections than Node 9 (degree 2), so we skip this edge.

23. For edge (9, 6):  
- Node 9 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 6 (degree 4).  
- No triangle formed with this edge.

24. For edge (9, 8):  
- Node 9 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 8 (degree 3).  
- No triangle formed with this edge.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 7> and <3, 0, 7>.
