Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

Sorted vertices by their connections:
0: 3 connections
2: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
6: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
1: 5 connections
9: 5 connections
7: 4 connections
3: 4 connections

Based on the sorted vertices, we will process the edges in the following order:

1. (0, 1) - No triangles.
2. (0, 4) - No triangles.
3. (0, 5) - No triangles.
4. (1, 0) - No triangles.
5. (1, 2) - No triangles.
6. (1, 5) - No triangles.
7. (1, 7) - No triangles.
8. (1, 9) - Triangle <1, 7, 9>.
9. (2, 1) - No triangles.
10. (2, 6) - No triangles.
11. (3, 4) - No triangles.
12. (3, 6) - No triangles.
13. (3, 8) - No triangles.
14. (3, 9) - Triangle <3, 7, 9>.
15. (4, 0) - No triangles.
16. (4, 3) - No triangles.
17. (5, 0) - No triangles.
18. (5, 1) - No triangles.
19. (6, 2) - No triangles.
20. (6, 3) - No triangles.
21. (6, 7) - No triangles.
22. (7, 1) - No triangles.
23. (7, 6) - No triangles.
24. (7, 8) - Triangle <3, 7, 8>.
25. (7, 9) - No triangles.
26. (8, 3) - No triangles.
27. (8, 7) - Triangle <1, 7, 8>.
28. (8, 9) - Triangle <3, 8, 9>.
29. (9, 1) - Triangle <1, 7, 9>.
30. (9, 3) - Triangle <3, 7, 9>.
31. (9, 7) - No triangles.
32. (9, 8) - No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <1, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <1, 7, 9>.
