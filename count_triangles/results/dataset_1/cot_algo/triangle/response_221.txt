Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph with vertices sorted by their degree:

Nodes: 3, 4, 8, 1, 5, 8, 6, 7, 0, 9

Now, let's check for triangles:

- Node 3 (degree 2): No triangles
- Node 4 (degree 2): No triangles
- Node 8 (degree 2): No triangles
- Node 1 (degree 2): No triangles
- Node 5 (degree 2): No triangles
- Node 8 (degree 2): No triangles
- Node 6 (degree 3): No triangles
- Node 7 (degree 4): No triangles
- Node 0 (degree 4): No triangles
- Node 9 (degree 5): <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <7, 9, 2>, <7, 9, 5>

Total number of triangles: [5]
