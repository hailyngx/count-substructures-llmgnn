Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves relabeling the vertices according to the number of connections each vertex has. Here is the list of vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most:

Node 5: 0 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2):
    - Node 0 has connections with nodes 2, 3, and 4.
    - Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 7, and 8.
    - Shared connections: 0 and 4.
    - Triangle: <0, 2, 4>

2. Edge (0, 3):
    - Node 0 has connections with nodes 2, 3, and 4.
    - Node 3 has connections with nodes 0 and 9.
    - Shared connections: 0.
    - Triangle: <0, 3, 9>

3. Edge (0, 4):
    - Node 0 has connections with nodes 2, 3, and 4.
    - Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9.
    - Shared connections: 0.
    - Triangle: <0, 4, 9>

4. Edge (1, 5): No triangle.

5. Edge (1, 6): No triangle.

6. Edge (1, 8): No triangle.

7. Edge (1, 9):
    - Node 1 has connections with nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9.
    - Node 9 has connections with nodes 3, 4, and 1.
    - Shared connections: 1.
    - Triangle: <1, 9, 4>

8. Edge (2, 7): No triangle.

9. Edge (2, 8): No triangle.

10. Edge (3, 9): No triangle.

11. Edge (4, 7):
    - Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9.
    - Node 7 has connections with nodes 2 and 4.
    - Shared connections: 4.
    - Triangle: <4, 7, 0>

12. Edge (5, 1): No triangle.

13. Edge (6, 1): No triangle.

14. Edge (7, 2): No triangle.

15. Edge (8, 1): No triangle.

16. Edge (8, 4):
    - Node 8 has connections with nodes 1, 2, 4.
    - Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9.
    - Shared connections: 4 and 8.
    - Triangle: <8, 4, 0>

17. Edge (9, 1):
    - Node 9 has connections with nodes 3, 4, and 1.
    - Node 1 has connections with nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9.
    - Shared connections: 1 and 9.
    - Triangle: <9, 1, 4>

18. Edge (9, 3):
    - Node 9 has connections with nodes 3, 4, and 1.
    - Node 3 has connections with nodes 0 and 9.
    - Shared connections: 9.
    - Triangle: <9, 3, 0>

Total number of triangles: [5]
Triangles found: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 0>, <8, 4, 0>
