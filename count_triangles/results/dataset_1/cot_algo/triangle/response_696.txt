Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have the following relabeling:
Node 2 has 0 connections.
Nodes 0, 1, 7, 8 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 3, 6, 9 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 4, 5 have 5 connections each.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Starting with the edge (0, 1):
- Node 0 has 1 connection: Node 4
- Node 1 has 1 connection: Node 6
  They share 0 common connections. No triangle found.

Moving on to the edge (0, 4):
- Node 0 has 1 connection: Node 1
- Node 4 has 5 connections: Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
  They share 1 common connection: Node 0
  Triangle <0, 1, 4> found.

Proceeding in this manner for all appropriate edges, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>, <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
