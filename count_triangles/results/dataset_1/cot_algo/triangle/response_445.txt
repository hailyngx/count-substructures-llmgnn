Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on their number of connections as follows:
Vertices: 7, 6, 1, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 7

Now, we consider the edges in order:
(1, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <1, 9, 5>
(2, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <2, 5, 3>
(2, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <2, 6, 9>
(2, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 8: <2, 8, 0>
(3, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <3, 5, 2>
(3, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <3, 0, 4>
(3, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <3, 7, 9>
(3, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 8: <3, 8, 0>
(4, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <4, 0, 8>
(6, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <6, 2, 5>
(6, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <6, 9, 1>
(6, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <6, 9, 7>
(6, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <6, 9, 5>
(7, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <7, 3, 5>
(7, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <7, 9, 1>
(7, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <7, 9, 5>
(8, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <8, 0, 4>
(8, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <8, 2, 5>
(9, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <9, 1, 3>
(9, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <9, 1, 7>
(9, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <9, 5, 3>
(9, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <9, 5, 7>
(9, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <9, 6, 2>

Total number of triangles: [22]
