Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices: 7, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3

After relabeling, the graph is as follows:
(0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7)

Now, we count the triangles:
[8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
