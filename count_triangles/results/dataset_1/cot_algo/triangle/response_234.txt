Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have the following relabeling:
Node 3: 1 connection
Nodes 1 and 6: 2 connections each
Nodes 2 and 5: 2 connections each
Nodes 7 and 4: 3 connections each
Nodes 0 and 9: 4 connections each
Node 8: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting the triangles by considering edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

Triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
