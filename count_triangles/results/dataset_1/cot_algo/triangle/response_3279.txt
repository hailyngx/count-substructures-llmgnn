Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's label the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 1

Now, we will proceed with counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. (7, 2): No triangle
2. (8, 4): No triangle
3. (1, 0): No triangle
4. (3,4): Triangle <3, 4, 5>
5. (0, 4): Triangle <0, 4, 3>
6. (2,7): No triangle
7. (5, 3): Triangle <3, 4, 5>
8. (5, 2): No triangle
9. (6, 4): Triangle <3, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <3, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 3>, <3, 4, 6>
