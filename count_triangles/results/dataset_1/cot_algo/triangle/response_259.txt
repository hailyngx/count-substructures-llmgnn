Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 1
- Vertex 3: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 1
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 4

Now, we'll sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order:
Vertices in order: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 1, 8, 0, 6, 9

Next, we will check the edges in order and count the triangles:
- Edge (2, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (3, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (4, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (5, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (1, 0): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (8, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (0, 1): Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>
- Edge (0, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (0, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (6, 0): Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>
- Edge (6, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (6, 8): Triangle formed: <0, 6, 8>
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (7, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (8, 6): Triangle formed: <0, 6, 8>
- Edge (8, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (9, 0): Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>
- Edge (9, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- Edge (9, 8): No triangles can be formed.

[Total number of triangles: 3]
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>
