Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new vertex order is: 2, 6, 8, 7, 0, 5, 1, 3, 4, 9.

Now, we will traverse the edges and count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 9) forms 2 triangles: <0, 9, 1> and <0, 9, 3>.
- Edge (1, 5) forms 1 triangle: <1, 5, 9>.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (1, 9) forms 1 triangle: <1, 9, 5>.
- Edge (2, 3) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 2) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 9) forms 1 triangle: <3, 9, 5>.
- Edge (4, 7) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (4, 9) forms 1 triangle: <4, 9, 7>.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (5, 9) forms 2 triangles: <5, 9, 1> and <5, 9, 7>.
- Edge (6, 1) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (7, 4) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (7, 9) forms 1 triangle: <7, 9, 4>.
- Edge (8, 4) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 0) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 1) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 3) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 4) does not form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 5) forms 1 triangle: <9, 5, 1>.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form any triangles.

Counting the triangles formed by the edges, the total number of triangles is [9].

So, the unique triangles found are: <0, 9, 1>, <0, 9, 3>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 9, 5>, <4, 9, 7>, <5, 9, 7>, <7, 9, 4>, <9, 5, 1>.
