Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, we get the following relabeling: 

Node 4 (Degree 1)  
Node 7 (Degree 2)  
Node 0 (Degree 3)  
Node 5 (Degree 3)  
Node 6 (Degree 3)  
Node 1 (Degree 3)  
Node 2 (Degree 4)  
Node 3 (Degree 4)  
Node 8 (Degree 5)  
Node 9 (Degree 5)  

Now, we will go through the edges based on the degree-based ordering:

Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed  
Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed  
Edge (0, 2): Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>   
Edge (5, 8): Triangle formed: <5, 8, 0>  
Edge (0, 8): Triangle formed: <0, 8, 5>  
Edge (2, 3): Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>  
Edge (2, 5): Triangle formed: <2, 5, 3>  
Edge (5, 3): Triangle formed: <5, 3, 2>  
Edge (3, 6): No triangles formed  
Edge (3, 9): Triangle formed: <3, 9, 8>  
Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed  

Counting all the triangles, we find a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
