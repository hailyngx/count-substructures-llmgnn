Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections

Relabeling the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 0 -> A
Vertex 1 -> B
Vertex 2 -> C
Vertex 4 -> D
Vertex 5 -> E
Vertex 8 -> F
Vertex 7 -> G
Vertex 9 -> H
Vertex 3 -> I

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we consider the edges in the following order:
(B, D), (F, I), (G, I), (H, I), (G, E), (F, I), (E, I), (H, D), (G, I), (H, D), (G, I), (D, I), (D, I), (I, A), (I, C)

Calculating the triangles formed:
1. Shared connections with (I, A): (I, 0, A) - <0, 2, 3>
2. Shared connections with (I, C): (I, C, 2) - <2, 3, 4>
3. Shared connections with (D, I): (D, I, H) - <1, 3, 4>

Total number of triangles: [3]
