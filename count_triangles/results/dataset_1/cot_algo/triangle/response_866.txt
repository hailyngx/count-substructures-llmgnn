Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 6 has 0 connections.
Nodes 0, 1, and 9 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 5 and 6 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 2 and 4 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 3 and 8 have 4 connections each.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8), (6, 7), (7, 1), (8, 2), (9, 4).

By traversing the edges, we find the following triangles: 
<1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 6>, <2, 5, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
