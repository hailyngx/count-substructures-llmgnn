Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees from lowest to highest:
Vertices: 8, 4, 0, 3, 1, 9, 5, 6, 7, 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 8 (degree 1) -> relabeled as 0
Vertex 4 (degree 2) -> relabeled as 1
Vertex 0 (degree 2) -> relabeled as 2
Vertex 3 (degree 2) -> relabeled as 3
Vertex 1 (degree 2) -> relabeled as 4
Vertex 9 (degree 2) -> relabeled as 5
Vertex 5 (degree 4) -> relabeled as 6
Vertex 6 (degree 3) -> relabeled as 7
Vertex 7 (degree 4) -> relabeled as 8
Vertex 2 (degree 4) -> relabeled as 9

Now, let's list unique triangles based on shared connections:
<2, 9, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 7, 2>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 6>
<6, 1, 5>
<7, 2, 9>
<7, 6, 1>

Counting the total number of triangles, we find there are 9 triangles in the graph.
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
