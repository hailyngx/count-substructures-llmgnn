Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the number of connections each vertex has:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections

Now, we re-label the vertices based on the number of connections in ascending order:
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Calculating the triangles: (vertex1, vertex7), (vertex1, vertex4), (vertex0, vertex3), (vertex0, vertex8), (vertex2, vertex5), (vertex2, vertex7), (vertex2, vertex6), (vertex3, vertex8), (vertex4, vertex7), (vertex5, vertex7), (vertex6, vertex8)

There are 11 triangles in total.

Output: [11]
Unique triangles: <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 8, 3>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 6>, <2, 6, 4>, <3, 8, 6>, <4, 7, 5>, <6, 8, 3>
