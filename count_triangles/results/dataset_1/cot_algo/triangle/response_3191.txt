Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 0 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 1 (Degree 0)  
Vertex 2 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 3 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 4 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 5 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 6 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 7 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 8 (Degree 4)  
Vertex 9 (Degree 2)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to find triangles, we consider the edges in the following order:  
(0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 3), (7, 8), (7, 9)

There are 3 triangles in the graph, and they are:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<3, 5, 8>  
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
