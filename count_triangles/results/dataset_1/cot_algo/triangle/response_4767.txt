Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Node 1: 2 edges
Node 6: 2 edges
Node 8: 2 edges
Node 4: 3 edges
Node 9: 3 edges
Node 0: 4 edges
Node 5: 5 edges
Node 3: 5 edges
Node 7: 6 edges
Node 2: 6 edges

Now, we will go through each edge starting from the one with the lower labeled vertex and count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2): Nodes 0 and 2 share Node 3, forming triangle <0, 2, 3>.
2. Edge (0, 3): Nodes 0 and 3 share Node 2, forming triangle <0, 3, 2>.
3. Edge (0, 5): No triangles can be formed as both nodes have equal or fewer connections.
4. Edge (0, 6): No triangles can be formed as both nodes have equal or fewer connections.
5. Edge (1, 4): No triangles can be formed as both nodes have equal or fewer connections.
6. Edge (1, 7): No triangles can be formed as both nodes have equal or fewer connections.
7. Edge (2, 3): No triangles can be formed as both nodes have equal connections.
8. Edge (2, 7): No triangles can be formed as both nodes have equal connections.
9. Edge (2, 8): No triangles can be formed as both nodes have equal or fewer connections.
10. Edge (3, 4): Nodes 3 and 4 share Node 7, forming triangle <3, 4, 7>.
11. Edge (3, 9): Nodes 3 and 9 share Node 5, forming triangle <3, 9, 5>.
12. Edge (4, 5): Nodes 4 and 5 share Nodes 0 and 7, forming triangles <4, 5, 0> and <4, 5, 7>.
13. Edge (4, 7): Nodes 4 and 7 share Node 1, forming triangle <4, 7, 1>.
14. Edge (5, 6): Nodes 5 and 6 share Node 0, forming triangle <5, 6, 0>.
15. Edge (5, 7): Nodes 5 and 7 share Node 4, forming triangle <5, 7, 4>.
16. Edge (5, 9): Nodes 5 and 9 share Nodes 3 and 7, forming triangles <5, 9, 3> and <5, 9, 7>.
17. Edge (6, 0): No triangles can be formed as both nodes have equal or fewer connections.
18. Edge (6, 5): Nodes 6 and 5 share Node 0, forming triangle <6, 5, 0>.
19. Edge (7, 1): No triangles can be formed as both nodes have equal or fewer connections.
20. Edge (7, 2): No triangles can be formed as both nodes have equal connections.
21. Edge (7, 4): Nodes 7 and 4 share Node 1, forming triangle <7, 4, 1>.
22. Edge (7, 5): Nodes 7 and 5 share Node 4, forming triangle <7, 5, 4>.
23. Edge (7, 8): No triangles can be formed as the edge doesn't satisfy the condition.
24. Edge (7, 9): Nodes 7 and 9 share Node 3, forming triangle <7, 9, 3>.
25. Edge (8, 2): No triangles can be formed as both nodes have equal or fewer connections.
26. Edge (8, 7): No triangles can be formed as the edge doesn't satisfy the condition.
27. Edge (9, 3): No triangles can be formed as both nodes have equal connections.
28. Edge (9, 5): Nodes 9 and 5 share Node 3, forming triangle <9, 5, 3>.
29. Edge (9, 7): Nodes 9 and 7 share Node 3, forming triangle <9, 7, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 16, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 2>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 9, 5>, <4, 5, 0>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 1>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 7, 4>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 9, 7>, <6, 5, 0>, <7, 4, 1>, <7, 5, 4>, <7, 9, 3>, <9, 5, 3>.
