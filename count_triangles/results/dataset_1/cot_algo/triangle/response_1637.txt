Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
Vertices: 3, 6, 4, 9, 1, 8, 2, 5, 7, 0

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
3 -> 0
6 -> 1
4 -> 2
9 -> 3
1 -> 4
8 -> 5
2 -> 6
5 -> 7
7 -> 8
0 -> 9

3. Proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Calculating the shared connections for each edge:
<2, 0, 9> - shared connection: 0
<5, 0, 3> - shared connection: 0
<8, 0, 5> - shared connection: 0
<9, 0, 7> - shared connection: 0
<4, 1, 7> - shared connection: 7
<6, 1, 7> - shared connection: 7
<7, 4, 8> - shared connection: 4
<7, 6, 8> - shared connection: 6
<7, 7, 9> - shared connection: 7

4. Count the triangles: 9 triangles found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9]. The unique triangles are <2, 0, 9>, <5, 0, 3>, <8, 0, 5>, <9, 0, 7>, <4, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 7>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 6, 8>, <7, 7, 9>.
