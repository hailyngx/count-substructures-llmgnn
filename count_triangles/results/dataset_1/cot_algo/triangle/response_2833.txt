Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 0 has degree 4
Vertex 1 has degree 3
Vertex 2 has degree 2
Vertex 3 has degree 3
Vertex 4 has degree 3
Vertex 5 has degree 2
Vertex 6 has degree 3
Vertex 7 has degree 2
Vertex 8 has degree 4
Vertex 9 has degree 4

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will identify the triangles in the graph. 

Calculating the triangles:
- For edge (0, 1): No triangle formed
- For edge (0, 2): No triangle formed
- For edge (0, 3): Triangle <0, 2, 3> found
- For edge (0, 9): No triangle formed
- For edge (1, 7): No triangle formed
- For edge (1, 9): No triangle formed
- For edge (2, 6): No triangle formed
- For edge (3, 6): Triangle <2, 3, 6> found
- For edge (3, 8): Triangle <2, 3, 8> found
- For edge (4, 5): No triangle formed
- For edge (4, 7): No triangle formed
- For edge (4, 9): No triangle formed
- For edge (5, 8): No triangle formed
- For edge (6, 8): Triangle <2, 6, 8> found

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>
