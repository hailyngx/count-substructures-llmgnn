Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
```
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 6
```

Now, we will count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 2):
   Both nodes have fewer connections than 2, so proceed.
   Shared connections with node 2: 1, 4
   Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>

2. Edge (0, 4):
   Node 0 has fewer connections than 4, so proceed.
   Shared connection with node 4: 1
   Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>

3. Edge (1, 2):
   Both nodes have fewer connections than 2, so proceed.
   Shared connections with node 2: 0, 4
   Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>

4. Edge (1, 4):
   Node 1 has fewer connections than 4, so proceed.
   Shared connection with node 4: 0
   Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>

5. Edge (2, 0):
   Node 0 has fewer connections than 2, so proceed.
   Shared connection with node 2: 1, 4
   Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>

6. Edge (2, 1):
   Node 1 has fewer connections than 2, so proceed.
   Shared connections with node 2: 0, 4
   Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>

7. Edge (2, 4):
   Node 2 has fewer connections than 4, so proceed.
   Shared connections with node 4: 0, 1
   Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>

8. Edge (2, 7):
   Node 2 has fewer connections than 7, so proceed.
   No triangle formed.

9. Edge (2, 3):
   Node 2 has fewer connections than 3, so proceed.
   No triangle formed.

10. Edge (2, 7):
    Node 2 has fewer connections than 7, so proceed.
    No triangle formed.

11. Edge (3, 8):
    Node 3 has fewer connections than 8, so proceed.
    No triangle formed.

12. Edge (3, 9):
    Node 3 has fewer connections than 9, so proceed.
    No triangle formed.

13. Edge (4, 7):
    Node 4 has fewer connections than 7, so proceed.
    No triangle formed.

14. Edge (4, 7):
    Node 4 has fewer connections than 7, so proceed.
    No triangle formed.

15. Edge (5, 6):
    Both nodes have fewer connections than 6, so proceed.
    No triangle formed.

16. Edge (5, 8):
    Node 5 has fewer connections than 8, so proceed.
    No triangle formed.

17. Edge (5, 9):
    Node 5 has fewer connections than 9, so proceed.
    No triangle formed.

18. Edge (6, 5):
    Node 5 has fewer connections than 6, so proceed.
    No triangle formed.

Adding up the triangles we found, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
