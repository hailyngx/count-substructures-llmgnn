Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
The vertices arranged in the Degree-Based Ordering are: (6, 7, 8, 5, 1, 2, 3, 0)

After sorting the vertices based on the number of connections, the edges to consider are: (6, 7), (7, 8), (7, 5), (5, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (0, 1), (3, 2), (0, 2), (3, 5), (0, 5), (5, 8), (0, 8)

Count of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 2>
