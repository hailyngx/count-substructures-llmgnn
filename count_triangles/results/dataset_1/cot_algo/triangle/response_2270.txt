Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the degree of each vertex:

- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, we will reorder the nodes based on their degrees:

0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 1

Next, we will list the triangles based on the shared connections between the vertices:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle 2: <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle 3: <1, 8, 9>

Finally, we count the total number of triangles, which is 3:
