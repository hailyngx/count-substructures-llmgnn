Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by their number of connections:
0 (degree 1), 1 (degree 1), 5 (degree 2), 7 (degree 2), 8 (degree 2), 9 (degree 2), 6 (degree 3), 4 (degree 4), 3 (degree 4), 2 (degree 5)

After relabeling:
0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 6, 4, 3, 2

Triangles formed:
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
