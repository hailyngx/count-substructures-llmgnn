Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). The sorted vertex list is as follows: 
Vertices: 3, 5, 8, 9, 6, 4, 0

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph:

Count of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 8>
