Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 1 has degree 1
Node 2 has degree 1
Node 8 has degree 1
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 6
Node 0 has degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle <3, 7, 8>
- Triangle <3, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
