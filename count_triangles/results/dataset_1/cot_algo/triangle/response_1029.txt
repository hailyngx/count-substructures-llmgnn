Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of vertices is: 7, 1, 6, 8, 4, 5, 9, 0, 2, 3. 

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

Considering edge (0, 3):
- Vertex 0: Connections with vertices 3, 8, 9
- Vertex 3: Connections with vertices 0, 2, 5

Both vertices have fewer connections, and they share vertex 5. So, triangle <0, 3, 5> is found.

Considering edge (0, 8):
- Vertex 0: Connections with vertices 3, 8, 9
- Vertex 8: Connections with vertices 2, 0

Since vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 8, this edge is skipped.

Considering edge (0, 9):
- Vertex 0: Connections with vertices 3, 8, 9
- Vertex 9: Connections with vertices 0, 4

Both vertices have fewer connections, and they share vertex 4. So, triangle <0, 9, 4> is found.

Considering edge (1, 5):
- Vertex 1: Connections with vertex 5
- Vertex 5: Connections with vertices 1, 3, 4, 6

Both vertices have fewer connections, and they share vertex 3. So, triangle <1, 5, 3> is found.

No more triangles can be found in this graph using the degree-based ordering method.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
