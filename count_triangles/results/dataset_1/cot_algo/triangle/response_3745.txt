Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following relabeling:
Vertices: 0 (degree 3), 1 (degree 3), 3 (degree 4), 6 (degree 3), 8 (degree 3), 2 (degree 2), 9 (degree 3), 4 (degree 2), 5 (degree 2), 7 (degree 1).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles, let's examine each edge:

1. (0, 1): Both vertices have the same degree and share a connection with vertex 3. Therefore, we have a triangle <0, 1, 3>.
2. (0, 3): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 3, and both share a connection with vertex 1. Therefore, we have a triangle <0, 3, 1>.
3. (0, 6): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 6, but they do not share any connection other than vertex 3.
4. (1, 3): Both vertices share a connection with vertex 0. Therefore, we have a triangle <1, 3, 0>.
5. (1, 9): Both vertices share a connection with vertex 3. Therefore, we have a triangle <1, 9, 3>.
6. (2, 8): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 8, but they do not share any connection.
7. (2, 9): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 9, and both share a connection with vertex 8. Therefore, we have a triangle <2, 9, 8>.
8. (3, 8): Vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 8, and both share a connection with vertices 0 and 1. Therefore, we have a triangle <3, 8, 0> and <3, 8, 1>.
9. (4, 5): Both vertices have the same degree and do not share any connection.
10. (4, 6): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 6, but they do not share any connection.
11. (5, 7): Both vertices share a connection with vertex 1. Therefore, we have a triangle <5, 7, 1>.
12. (6, 8): Vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 8, and both share a connection with vertex 3. Therefore, we have a triangle <6, 8, 3>.
13. (8, 9): Vertex 8 has fewer connections than vertex 9, and both share a connection with vertex 3. Therefore, we have a triangle <8, 9, 3>.
14. (9, 1): Both vertices share a connection with vertex 3. Therefore, we have a triangle <9, 1, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
