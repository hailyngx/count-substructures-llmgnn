Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree from least to most connections, we have the following order:  
Vertices: 2, 7, 0, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8, 9, 4

By examining the edges and considering the vertices based on their labeled order, we can count the triangles.

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count a total of 7 triangles:

Unique triangles:  
<1, 3, 6>  
<1, 5, 6>  
<1, 8, 9>  
<1, 3, 4>  
<3, 4, 8>  
<3, 4, 9>  
<4, 7, 9>
