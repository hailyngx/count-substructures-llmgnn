Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 3 has 1 connection   
Node 5 has 2 connections   
Nodes 2 and 8 have 3 connections each  
Nodes 4 and 7 have 4 connections each   
Nodes 0, 1, and 9 have 5 connections each   
  
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles by following the given edges.  

We find the following triangles:  
<0, 1, 9>  
<1, 4, 9>  
<1, 8, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
