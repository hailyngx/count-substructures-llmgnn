Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections.

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 7, 8, 9, 2, 6, 3, 5, 0, 1, 4

Now we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections. 

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
