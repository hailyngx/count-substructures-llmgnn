Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is: 

Vertices: 0(2), 1(1), 3(2), 4(1), 2(2), 6(3), 5(3), 8(3), 7(4), 9(4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 6: <0, 4, 5>
2. Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 6: <0, 5, 6>
3. Edge (2, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 8: <2, 6, 5>
4. Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 7: <2, 8, 6>
5. Edge (3, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 8: <3, 7, 5>
6. Edge (7, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 8: <7, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
