Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 3 has degree 2
- Vertex 4 has degree 1
- Vertex 6 has degree 1
- Vertex 8 has degree 1
- Vertex 9 has degree 3
- Vertex 7 has degree 5
- Vertex 5 has degree 5
- Vertex 0 has degree 5
- Vertex 2 has degree 5
- Vertex 1 has degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(3, 6), (3, 9), (6, 3), (8, 0), (8, 0), (8, 0), (4, 1), (4, 1), (4, 1), (9, 5), (9, 5), (6, 3)

By examining shared connections, we find the triangles:
<3, 6, 9>

Counting the triangles found, we have a total of [1] triangle in the given graph.
