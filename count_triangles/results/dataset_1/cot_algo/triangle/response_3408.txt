Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Vertex 5 - 1 connection  
Vertices 9, 2, 8 - 0 connections  
Vertices 6, 1 - 2 connections  
Vertices 0, 3, 9, 4 - 4 connections  
Vertex 7 - 6 connections  

Now we will check each edge based on the degree-based ordering:
