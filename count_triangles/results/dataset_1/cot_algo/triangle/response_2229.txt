Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
1. Node 3: 2 connections
2. Node 6: 3 connections
3. Node 9: 3 connections
4. Node 2: 4 connections
5. Node 1: 4 connections
6. Node 7: 4 connections
7. Node 5: 4 connections
8. Node 0: 5 connections
9. Node 8: 5 connections
10. Node 4: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

After checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 7, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 8, 5>
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 1, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<8, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [18].
