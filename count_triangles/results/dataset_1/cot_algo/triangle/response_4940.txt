Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Vertices: 7, 0, 3, 9, 8, 4, 1, 5, 6, 2

Now, let's relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 7 (2 connections) becomes 0
Vertex 0 (3 connections) becomes 1
Vertex 3 (3 connections) becomes 2
Vertex 9 (3 connections) becomes 3
Vertex 8 (4 connections) becomes 4
Vertex 4 (5 connections) becomes 5
Vertex 1 (5 connections) becomes 6
Vertex 5 (6 connections) becomes 7
Vertex 6 (7 connections) becomes 8
Vertex 2 (8 connections) becomes 9

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Check each edge to see if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
(0, 6) - Both have 3 connections, so skip.
(0, 8) - 1 has 3 connections, while 4 has 5 connections. There is a possibility of a triangle with vertex 1.
(1, 2) - Both have 5 connections, so skip.
(1, 4) - Both have 5 connections, so skip.
(1, 6) - Both have 5 connections, so skip.
(2, 1) - Both have 5 connections, so skip.
(2, 3) - Both have 8 connections, so skip.
(2, 4) - 5 has 5 connections, while 4 has 5 connections. There is a possibility of a triangle with vertex 5.
(2, 5) - Both have 6 connections, so skip.
(2, 7) - Both have 2 connections, so skip.
(2, 8) - 5 has 5 connections, while 4 has 5 connections. There is a possibility of a triangle with vertex 5.
(3, 2) - Both have 8 connections, so skip.
(3, 5) - Both have 6 connections, so skip.
(4, 1) - Both have 5 connections, so skip.
(4, 2) - 5 has 5 connections, while 4 has 5 connections. There is a possibility of a triangle with vertex 5.
(4, 5) - 5 has 5 connections, while 4 has 5 connections. There is a possibility of a triangle with vertex 5.
(4, 8) - 5 has 5 connections, while 4 has 5 connections. There is a possibility of a triangle with vertex 5.
(5, 2) - Both have 6 connections, so skip.
(5, 3) - Both have 6 connections, so skip.
(5, 4) - Both have 6 connections, so skip.
(5, 9) - Both have 3 connections, so skip.
(6, 0) - 4 has 5 connections, while 1 has 3 connections. There is a possibility of a triangle with vertex 1.
(6, 1) - 4 has 5 connections, while 1 has 3 connections. There is a possibility of a triangle with vertex 1.
(6, 7) - Both have 2 connections, so skip.
(6, 9) - Both have 3 connections, so skip.
(7, 2) - Both have 2 connections, so skip.
(7, 6) - Both have 2 connections, so skip.
(8, 0) - 5 has 5 connections, while 1 has 3 connections. There is a possibility of a triangle with vertex 1.
(8, 2) - 5 has 5 connections, while 4 has 5 connections. There is a possibility of a triangle with vertex 5.
(8, 4) - 5 has 5 connections, while 4 has 5 connections. There is a possibility of a triangle with vertex 5.
(9, 5) - Both have 6 connections, so skip.
(9, 6) - Both have 3 connections, so skip.
