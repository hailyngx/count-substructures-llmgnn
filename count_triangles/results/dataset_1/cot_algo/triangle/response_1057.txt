Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 7: Degree 0
- Node 3: Degree 1
- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 6: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 5
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 8: Degree 5
- Node 4: Degree 6
- Node 0: Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:

Node 7 - Node 4: No triangle
Node 3 - Node 1: No triangle
Node 2 - Node 4: No triangle
Node 6 - Node 1: No triangle
Node 5 - Node 4: <5, 4, 2>
Node 9 - Node 8: <9, 8, 0>
Node 9 - Node 0: No triangle
Node 9 - Node 1: <9, 1, 8>
Node 5 - Node 3: No triangle
Node 6 - Node 5: <6, 5, 1>
Node 9 - Node 6: <9, 6, 1>
Node 1 - Node 8: <1, 8, 0>
Node 8 - Node 0: No triangle
Node 8 - Node 1: No triangle
Node 2 - Node 5: <2, 5, 4>
Node 4 - Node 5: No triangle
Node 0 - Node 4: No triangle
Node 0 - Node 2: No triangle
Node 0 - Node 9: <0, 9, 8>
Node 0 - Node 1: No triangle

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <5, 4, 2>, <9, 8, 0>, <9, 1, 8>, <6, 5, 1>, <9, 6, 1>, <2, 5, 4>
