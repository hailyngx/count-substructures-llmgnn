Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. 
Here is the sorted list of vertices and their connections:
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 5 connections
- Vertex 0: 5 connections
- Vertex 9: 5 connections

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For Vertex 2 (1 connection):
   - No triangles can be formed.

2. For Vertex 8 (2 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

3. For Vertex 2 (2 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

4. For Vertex 7 (3 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

5. For Vertex 6 (3 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

6. For Vertex 3 (3 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

7. For Vertex 4 (4 connections):
   - No triangles can be formed.

8. For Vertex 1 (5 connections):
   - Possible triangles: <1, 0, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 9>

9. For Vertex 0 (5 connections):
   - Possible triangles: <0, 7, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 1, 5>

10. For Vertex 9 (5 connections):
    - Possible triangles: <9, 7, 1>, <9, 4, 1>, <9, 0, 7>

Total number of triangles: [6]
