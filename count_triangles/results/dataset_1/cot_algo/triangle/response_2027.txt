Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering is as follows:
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6
Node 6: degree 6

Using the degree-based ordering, let's count the triangles:
(1) Edge between node 7 and node 8 cannot form a triangle as both have the same degree.
(2) Edge between node 0 and node 4 cannot form a triangle as 0 has no edge with node 4.
(3) Edge between node 0 and node 6 can form a triangle with node 4, so one triangle <0, 4, 6>.
(4) Edge between node 1 and node 3 cannot form a triangle as 1 has no edge with node 3.
(5) Edge between node 1 and node 5 can form a triangle with node 2, so one triangle <1, 2, 5>.
(6) Edge between node 1 and node 6 can form a triangle with node 3, so one triangle <1, 3, 6>.
(7) Edge between node 2 and node 3 cannot form a triangle as 2 has no edge with node 3.
(8) Edge between node 2 and node 4 can form a triangle with node 5, so one triangle <2, 4, 5>.
(9) Edge between node 2 and node 5 cannot form a triangle as 2 has no edge with node 5.
(10) Edge between node 3 and node 1 cannot form a triangle as 1 has no edge with node 3.
(11) Edge between node 3 and node 6 can form a triangle with node 4, so one triangle <3, 4, 6>.
(12) Edge between node 4 and node 0 cannot form a triangle as 0 has no edge with node 4.
(13) Edge between node 4 and node 2 cannot form a triangle as 2 has no edge with node 4.
(14) Edge between node 4 and node 5 can form a triangle with node 6, so one triangle <4, 5, 6>.
(15) Edge between node 4 and node 6 can form a triangle with node 5, so one triangle <4, 5, 6>.
(16) Edge between node 4 and node 7 can form a triangle with node 8, so one triangle <4, 7, 8>.
(17) Edge between node 4 and node 9 can form a triangle with node 5, so one triangle <4, 5, 9>.
(18) Edge between node 5 and node 1 cannot form a triangle as 1 has no edge with node 5.
(19) Edge between node 5 and node 2 cannot form a triangle as 2 has no edge with node 5.
(20) Edge between node 5 and node 4 cannot form a triangle as 4 has no edge with node 5.
(21) Edge between node 5 and node 9 can form a triangle with node 6, so one triangle <5, 6, 9>.
(22) Edge between node 6 and node 0 cannot form a triangle as 0 has no edge with node 6.
(23) Edge between node 6 and node 1 can form a triangle with node 3, so one triangle <1, 3, 6>.
(24) Edge between node 6 and node 3 can form a triangle with node 4, so one triangle <3, 4, 6>.
(25) Edge between node 6 and node 4 can form a triangle with node 5, so one triangle <4, 5, 6>.
(26) Edge between node 6 and node 8 can form a triangle with node 7, so one triangle <6, 7, 8>.
(27) Edge between node 6 and node 9 can form a triangle with node 4, so one triangle <4, 6, 9>.
(28) Edge between node 7 and node 4 can form a triangle with node 8, so one triangle <4, 7, 8>.
(29) Edge between node 7 and node 8 can form a triangle with node 6, so one triangle <6, 7, 8>.
(30) Edge between node 8 and node 6 can form a triangle with node 7, so one triangle <6, 7, 8>.
(31) Edge between node 8 and node 7 can form a triangle with node 6, so one triangle <6, 7, 8>.
(32) Edge between node 9 and node 4 can form a triangle with node 5, so one triangle <4, 5, 9>.
(33) Edge between node 9 and node 5 can form a triangle with node 6, so one triangle <5, 6, 9>.
(34) Edge between node 9 and node 6 can form a triangle with node 4, so one triangle <4, 6, 9>.
