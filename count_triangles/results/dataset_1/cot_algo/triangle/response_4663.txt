Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 1 (degree 1) becomes Node 0
- Node 2 (degree 2) becomes Node 1
- Node 4 (degree 2) becomes Node 2
- Node 5 (degree 2) becomes Node 3
- Node 9 (degree 2) becomes Node 4
- Node 0 (degree 3) becomes Node 5
- Node 8 (degree 3) becomes Node 6
- Node 7 (degree 4) becomes Node 7

After relabeling, the edges in the new graph are:
(0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4)

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Triangles involving Node 0: None
- Triangles involving Node 1: <1, 2, 7>
- Triangles involving Node 2: None
- Triangles involving Node 4: None
- Triangles involving Node 5: <3, 4, 6>
- Triangles involving Node 6: None
- Triangles involving Node 7: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles are <1, 2, 7> and <3, 4, 6>.
