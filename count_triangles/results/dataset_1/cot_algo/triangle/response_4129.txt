Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method first requires us to sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices:  
0 (degree 2)  
1 (degree 1)  
3 (degree 2)  
4 (degree 1)  
7 (degree 1)  
8 (degree 1)  
2 (degree 2)  
6 (degree 2)  
9 (degree 4)  

Reordering the vertices from least connected to most connected:  
1, 4, 7, 8, 0, 3, 6, 2, 9  

Next, we will count the triangles by examining each edge:

- Edge (1, 0):  
Vertex 0 has 2 connections: 1, 9  
Vertex 1 has 1 connection: 0  
Shared connection: 0  
Triangle: <0, 1, 9>

- Edge (2, 7):  
Vertex 2 has 2 connections: 7, 9  
Vertex 7 has 1 connection: 2  
No triangle formed.

- Edge (2, 9):  
Vertex 2 has 2 connections: 7, 9  
Vertex 9 has 4 connections: 2, 6, 8  
Shared connections: 2  
Triangles: <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>

- Edge (3, 4):  
Vertex 3 has 2 connections: 4, 6  
Vertex 4 has 1 connection: 3  
Shared connection: 3  
Triangle: <3, 4, 6>

- Edge (3, 6):  
Vertex 3 has 2 connections: 4, 6  
Vertex 6 has 2 connections: 3, 9  
Shared connection: 3  
Triangle: <3, 6, 9>

- Edge (6, 9):  
Vertex 6 has 2 connections: 3, 9  
Vertex 9 has 4 connections: 2, 6, 8  
Shared connection: 6  
Triangle: <6, 9, 2>, <6, 9, 8>

- Edge (7, 2):  
Vertex 7 has 1 connection: 2  
Vertex 2 has 2 connections: 7, 9  
No triangle formed.

- Edge (8, 9):  
Vertex 8 has 1 connection: 9  
Vertex 9 has 4 connections: 2, 6, 8  
Shared connection: 9  
Triangle: <8, 9, 2>, <8, 9, 6>

- Edge (9, 2):  
Vertex 9 has 4 connections: 2, 6, 8  
Vertex 2 has 2 connections: 7, 9  
Shared connection: 2  
Triangle: <9, 2, 7>

- Edge (9, 6):  
Vertex 9 has 4 connections: 2, 6, 8  
Vertex 6 has 2 connections: 3, 9  
Shared connection: 9  
Triangle: <9, 6, 3>

By examining all edges, we have found a total of 11 triangles inside brackets: [11].
