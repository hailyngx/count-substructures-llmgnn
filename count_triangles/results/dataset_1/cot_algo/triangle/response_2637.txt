Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree. Here is the sorted list of nodes:
Nodes: 7, 2, 9, 8, 3, 5, 0, 6, 1, 4

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges in order:

1. Edge (7, 8): Proceed since node 7 has fewer connections than node 8. No triangles formed.

2. Edge (2, 5): Proceed since node 2 has fewer connections than node 5. No triangles formed.

3. Edge (9, 8): Proceed since node 9 has fewer connections than node 8. No triangles formed.

4. Edge (8, 3): Proceed since node 8 has fewer connections than node 3. No triangles formed.

5. Edge (3, 4): Proceed since node 3 has fewer connections than node 4. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>

6. Edge (5, 6): Proceed since node 5 has fewer connections than node 6. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>

7. Edge (0, 6): Proceed since node 0 has fewer connections than node 6. No triangles formed.

8. Edge (6, 1): Proceed since node 6 has fewer connections than node 1. No triangles formed.

9. Edge (1, 4): Proceed since node 1 has fewer connections than node 4. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 9>

10. Edge (4, 0): Proceed since node 4 has fewer connections than node 0. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>

The total number of triangles is [4].
