Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the given graph efficiently.

First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
- Node 4 has 1 edge
- Nodes 0, 7, 6 have 2 edges each
- Nodes 5, 8 have 3 edges each
- Nodes 3, 9 have 4 edges each
- Node 1 has 5 edges

Reassigning labels to the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 4 is now Node 0
- Nodes 0, 7, 6 are now Nodes 1, 2, 3
- Nodes 5, 8 are now Nodes 4, 5
- Nodes 3, 9 are now Nodes 6, 7
- Node 1 is now Node 8

Next, we will examine the edges in the graph based on the new labeling:
- (1, 8), (1, 6), (1, 4), (4, 7), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 7), (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 7)

Analyzing these edges, we find the following triangles:
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <6, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9], and the unique triangles found are <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, and <6, 5, 8>.
