Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes arranged in order of connections:
1. Node 1: 0 connections
2. Node 2: 0 connections
3. Node 3: 1 connection
4. Node 4: 2 connections
5. Node 7: 2 connections
6. Node 8: 2 connections
7. Node 9: 2 connections
8. Node 0: 3 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree-based ordering:
- Node 1 and Node 2 (0 connections) can be assigned any label.
- Node 3 (1 connection) can be assigned the label 1.
- Nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9 (2 connections) can be assigned labels 2, 3, 4, and 5 (in any order).
- Node 0 (3 connections) will be assigned the label 6.

Using the relabeled nodes and the given edges, we can now count the number of triangles by identifying shared connections between the endpoints of each edge:

Triangles:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 8, 2>
4. <0, 8, 9>
5. <3, 0, 9>
6. <4, 1, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
