Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:

- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections

Therefore, we will relabel the vertices in increasing order based on their degree:
- Node 4 (Degree: 1) -> Relabel as 0
- Node 5 (Degree: 1) -> Relabel as 1
- Node 1 (Degree: 2) -> Relabel as 2
- Node 7 (Degree: 2) -> Relabel as 3
- Node 0 (Degree: 3) -> Relabel as 4
- Node 2 (Degree: 3) -> Relabel as 5
- Node 9 (Degree: 3) -> Relabel as 6
- Node 3 (Degree: 4) -> Relabel as 7

Now, we will list the edges and find the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (0, 1): No triangles
2. (0, 2): Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
3. (0, 9): No triangles
4. (1, 3): No triangles
5. (2, 3): Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>
6. (3, 5): No triangles
7. (3, 9): No triangles
8. (4, 7): No triangles
9. (5, 3): No triangles
10. (7, 2): Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>
11. (7, 4): No triangles
12. (9, 0): No triangles
13. (9, 3): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4> and <2, 3, 5>.
