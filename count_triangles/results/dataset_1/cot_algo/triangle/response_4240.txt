Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling will be as follows:
- Vertex 0 has 4 connections
- Vertex 1 has 2 connections
- Vertex 3 has 2 connections
- Vertex 4 has 2 connections
- Vertex 5 has 2 connections
- Vertex 6 has 2 connections
- Vertex 7 has 5 connections
- Vertex 2 has 3 connections
- Vertex 9 has 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Then we check for shared connections to count the triangles.

By applying this method, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 2, 5>
4. <0, 2, 9>
5. <2, 5, 9>
6. <4, 6, 7>
7. <0, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
