Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following order: 

Node 0 has 2 connections.  
Node 4 has 2 connections.  
Node 2 has 3 connections.  
Node 5 has 3 connections.  
Node 6 has 4 connections.  
Node 9 has 4 connections.  
Node 8 has 4 connections.  
Node 7 has 5 connections.  
Node 1 has 6 connections.  
Node 3 has 6 connections.  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check for triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Nodes 0 and 1 share a connection with Node 3, forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.  
2. Edge (0, 3): Direct edge, no triangle.  
3. Edge (1, 3): Direct edge, no triangle.  
4. Edge (1, 5): Nodes 1 and 5 share a connection with Node 3, forming a triangle <1, 5, 3>.  
5. Edge (1, 7): Nodes 1 and 7 share a connection, forming a triangle <1, 7, 3>.  
6. Edge (1, 8): Nodes 1 and 8 share a connection with Node 6, forming a triangle <1, 8, 6>  
7. Edge (1, 9): Nodes 1 and 9 share a connection with Node 6, forming a triangle <1, 9, 6>  
8. Edge (2, 3): Nodes 2 and 3 share a connection with Node 7, forming a triangle <2, 3, 7>.  
9. Edge (2, 7): Direct edge, no triangle.  
10. Edge (3, 5): Nodes 3 and 5 share a connection, forming a triangle <3, 5, 1>.  
11. Edge (3, 7): Nodes 3 and 7 share a connection, forming a triangle <3, 7, 1>.  
12. Edge (4, 6): Nodes 4 and 6 directly connected, no triangle.  
13. Edge (5, 6): Nodes 5 and 6 share a connection with Node 8, forming a triangle <5, 6, 8>.  
14. Edge (6, 8): Nodes 6 and 8 directly connected, forming a triangle <6, 8, 1>.  
15. Edge (6, 9): Nodes 6 and 9 directly connected, no triangle.  
16. Edge (7, 8): Nodes 7 and 8 share a connection, forming a triangle <7, 8, 1>.  
17. Edge (8, 9): Nodes 8 and 9 share a connection, forming a triangle <8, 9, 1>.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
