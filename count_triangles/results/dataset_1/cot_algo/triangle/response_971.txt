Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 3 has 1 connection.
Vertex 1 has 1 connection.
Vertex 8 has 1 connection.
Vertex 4 has 2 connections.
Vertex 5 has 3 connections.
Vertex 6 has 4 connections.
Vertex 7 has 4 connections.
Vertex 0 has 4 connections.
Vertex 2 has 4 connections.
Vertex 9 has 5 connections.

We will now count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method.

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
