Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we obtain the following ordering: 

Vertex 4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 9, 7, 1, 0, 8

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

[8]

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 6, 0>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 7>
