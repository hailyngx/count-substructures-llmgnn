Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices with their connections are:
0: 1 connection
1: 3 connections
5: 2 connections
4: 0 connections
7: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
8: 4 connections
2: 0 connections
3: 5 connections
9: 4 connections

Based on the sorted vertices, the unique triangles and their vertices are:
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<7, 6, 9>

The total number of triangles is [4].
