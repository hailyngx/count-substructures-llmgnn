Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we get the following relabeling: 

Vertex 0 has degree 2  
Vertex 5 has degree 2  
Vertex 7 has degree 2  
Vertex 8 has degree 2  
Vertex 9 has degree 2  
Vertex 1 has degree 4  
Vertex 3 has degree 4  
Vertex 2 has degree 3  
Vertex 4 has degree 5  
Vertex 6 has degree 6  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges in the following order:  
(0, 4)  
(1, 2)  
(1, 5)  
(1, 6)  
(1, 7)  
(2, 8)  
(3, 4)  
(3, 7)  
(3, 9)  
(4, 6)  
(5, 6)  
(6, 8)  
(6, 9)  

Counting the triangles formed by the edges, we find that there are 3 triangles in total. The triangles are:  
<1, 6, 4>  
<3, 6, 9>  
<4, 6, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
