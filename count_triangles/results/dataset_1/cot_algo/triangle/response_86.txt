Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 1 connection.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.

Based on the connections, we will relabel the nodes as follows:
Node 0 -> Node 4
Node 1 -> Node 6
Node 4 -> Node 0
Node 6 -> Node 1
Node 7 -> Node 5
Node 8 -> Node 5
Node 5 -> Node 7
Node 3 -> Node 9
Node 9 -> Node 8
Node 2 -> Node 3

Now, we will check for triangles:
- Triangle <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle <0, 9, 2>
- Triangle <1, 6, 3>
- Triangle <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle <3, 9, 8>
- Triangle <5, 7, 8>
- Triangle <5, 8, 2>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
