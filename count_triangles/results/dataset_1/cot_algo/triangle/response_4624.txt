Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 2 -> Degree 1
Vertex 1 -> Degree 2
Vertex 5 -> Degree 2
Vertex 9 -> Degree 2
Vertex 3 -> Degree 3
Vertex 6 -> Degree 4
Vertex 4 -> Degree 5

Relabeling the vertices based on the degree-based ordering:

2 -> 1
1 -> 2
5 -> 3
9 -> 4
3 -> 5
6 -> 6
4 -> 7

Now, we iterate through each edge to count the triangles:

(1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 have degrees less than 4, forming a triangle with 4: <1, 4, 6>
(2, 4) - Both have degrees less than 5, forming a triangle with 5: <2, 3, 5>
(3, 5) - Both have degrees less than 6, forming a triangle with 6: <1, 5, 6>
(3, 9) - Both have degrees less than 7, forming a triangle with 7: <1, 5, 6>
(4, 2) - Proceeding to the next edge
(4, 5) - Both have degrees less than 6, forming a triangle with 6: <1, 4, 6>
(4, 6) - Both have degrees less than 7, forming a triangle with 7: <1, 4, 6>
(5, 3) - Proceeding to the next edge
(5, 4) - Proceeding to the next edge
(6, 1) - Proceeding to the next edge
(6, 4) - Proceeding to the next edge
(6, 9) - Proceeding to the next edge
(9, 3) - Proceeding to the next edge
(9, 6) - Proceeding to the next edge

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles found:
