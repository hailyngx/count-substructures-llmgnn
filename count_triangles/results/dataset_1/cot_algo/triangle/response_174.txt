Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new order is: 8, 9, 3, 5, 7, 4, 6, 1, 2, 0.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges as follows:

Edge (3, 2) - Proceed
Edge (5, 0) - Proceed
Edge (7, 0) - Proceed
Edge (6, 1) - Proceed
Edge (6, 2) - Proceed

Count of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 3>, <1, 6, 2>, <0, 7, 4>
