Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes and their connections:

- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their connections from least to most:
Nodes: 1, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 9, 7, 0, 2

Next, we will relabel the nodes:
- Node 1 becomes Node 0
- Node 8 becomes Node 1
- Node 6 becomes Node 2
- Node 5 becomes Node 3
- Node 4 becomes Node 4
- Node 3 becomes Node 5
- Node 9 becomes Node 6
- Node 7 becomes Node 7
- Node 0 becomes Node 8
- Node 2 becomes Node 9

Now, let's list the edges based on the relabeled nodes:
- (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7)

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle <2, 5, 9>

There are 2 triangles in total, so the final output is: [2]
