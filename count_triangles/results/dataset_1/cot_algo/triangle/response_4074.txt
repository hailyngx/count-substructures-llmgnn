Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

Node degrees:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 1
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 2

Sorting nodes by degree:
Node 5, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 8, 0, 3

Checking edges of lower degree nodes:
(5, 9) - No triangle
(2, 3) - Triangle: <2, 3, 0>
(4, 1) - No triangle
(6, 1) - No triangle
(7, 0) - No triangle
(9, 0) - No triangle

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <2, 3, 0>
