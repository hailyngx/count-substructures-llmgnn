Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows:  
Vertex 2: 2 connections  
Vertices 5, 7, 9: 3 connections  
Vertices 3, 6: 4 connections  
Vertices 1, 8: 5 connections  
Vertex 0: 6 connections  

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 1):
   - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 3, 4, 7, 8.
   - Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9.
   - Shared connections of vertices 0 and 1: 3, 4
   - Triangle found: <0, 1, 4>

2. Edge (0, 3):
   - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 3, 4, 7, 8.
   - Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 0, 1, 5.
   - Shared connections of vertices 0 and 3: 1
   - No new triangle found.

3. Edge (0, 4):
   - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 3, 4, 7, 8.
   - Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 0, 1, 5, 6, 7.
   - Shared connections of vertices 0 and 4: 1, 7
   - Triangle found: <0, 4, 7>

Total number of triangles: [2]
