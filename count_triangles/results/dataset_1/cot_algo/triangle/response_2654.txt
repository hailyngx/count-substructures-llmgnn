Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 1

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles and output the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found. 

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 6>
