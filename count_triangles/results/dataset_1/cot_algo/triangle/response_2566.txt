Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given graph and its edges, we can sort the vertices by the number of connections:

Vertices: 2-1 Connection, 9-2 Connections, 4-2 Connections, 0-2 Connections, 1-2 Connections, 7-2 Connections, 6-3 Connections, 3-4 Connections, 8-4 Connections, 5-6 Connections

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can relabel the vertices as follows:

Vertex 0 (2 Connections) - relabeled as Vertex 0
Vertex 1 (2 Connections) - relabeled as Vertex 1
Vertex 2 (1 Connection) - relabeled as Vertex 2
Vertex 3 (4 Connections) - relabeled as Vertex 3
Vertex 4 (2 Connections) - relabeled as Vertex 4
Vertex 5 (6 Connections) - relabeled as Vertex 5
Vertex 6 (3 Connections) - relabeled as Vertex 6
Vertex 7 (2 Connections) - relabeled as Vertex 7
Vertex 8 (4 Connections) - relabeled as Vertex 8
Vertex 9 (2 Connections) - relabeled as Vertex 9

Now, we will count the number of triangles by examining each edge:

- Edge (0, 8): No triangles
- Edge (1, 7): No triangles
- Edge (2, 3): No triangles
- Edge (3, 2): No triangles
- Edge (3, 5): Triangle <3, 2, 5>
- Edge (4, 5): No triangles
- Edge (5, 3): Triangle <5, 3, 2>
- Edge (5, 4): No triangles
- Edge (5, 6): No triangles
- Edge (5, 9): No triangles
- Edge (6, 5): No triangles
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles
- Edge (7, 1): No triangles
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles
- Edge (8, 0): No triangles
- Edge (8, 7): No triangles
- Edge (9, 5): No triangles
- Edge (9, 6): No triangles

Count of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <3, 2, 5>, <5, 3, 2>
