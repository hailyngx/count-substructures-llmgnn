Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertex 0 - Degree 3
Vertex 1 - Degree 2
Vertex 4 - Degree 4
Vertex 3 - Degree 3
Vertex 2 - Degree 3
Vertex 5 - Degree 6
Vertex 6 - Degree 6
Vertex 7 - Degree 6
Vertex 8 - Degree 3
Vertex 9 - Degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we go through each edge to count the number of triangles:
- (0, 5): Forms triangles with (3, 5) and (4, 5)
- (0, 6): Forms triangles with (4, 6) and (5, 6)
- (0, 7): Forms triangles with (5, 7) and (6, 7)
- (1, 6): Forms a triangle with (5, 6)
- (1, 9): Forms a triangle with (7, 9)
- (2, 3): No triangles formed
- (2, 8): No triangles formed
- (2, 9): Forms a triangle with (7, 9)
- (3, 5): Forms a triangle with (4, 5)
- (3, 8): No triangles formed
- (4, 5): Forms a triangle with (5, 6)
- (4, 6): Forms a triangle with (5, 6)
- (4, 7): Forms a triangle with (5, 7)
- (6, 7): Forms a triangle with (5, 7)
- (7, 9): Forms a triangle with (5, 9)
- (8, 9): No triangles formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13], and the unique triangles found are: 
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 9>
