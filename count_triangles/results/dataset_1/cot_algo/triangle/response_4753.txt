Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly:
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 0
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will use the following edges to count the triangles:
(0, 2), (0, 9), (2, 4), (3, 4), (6, 8), (7, 8), and (8, 9)

Counting the triangles formed by these edges:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
