Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels will be:
Node 3: 1 connection
Nodes 1, 9: 1 connection
Nodes 7, 8: 2 connections
Nodes 0, 4: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check for triangles using the edges:
(0, 2) - Both 0 and 2 have 3 connections, so we proceed.
Shared connections between 0 and 2: 4
Triangle found: <0, 2, 4>

(0, 4) - Node 0 has 3 connections, node 4 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
Shared connections between 0 and 4: 2
Triangle found: <0, 2, 4>

(1, 8) - Node 1 has 1 connection, node 8 has 2 connections, so we proceed.
No triangles can be made with this edge.

(2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 have 2 connections, so we proceed.
Shared connections between 2 and 7: None
No triangles can be made with this edge.

(2, 9) - Node 2 has 4 connections, node 9 has 1 connection, so we proceed.
No triangles can be made with this edge.

(3, 7) - Node 3 has 1 connection, node 7 has 2 connections, so we proceed.
No triangles can be made with this edge.

(4, 8) - Node 4 has 3 connections, node 8 has 2 connections, so we proceed.
No triangles can be made with this edge.

(7, 3) - Node 7 has 2 connections, node 3 has 1 connection, so we proceed.
No triangles can be made with this edge.

(8, 1) - Node 8 has 2 connections, node 1 has 1 connection, so we proceed.
No triangles can be made with this edge.

(9, 2) - Node 9 has 1 connection, node 2 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
No triangles can be made with this edge.

The total number of triangles found is [1] which is <0, 2, 4>.
