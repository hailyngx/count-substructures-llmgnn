Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0 has 2 connections.
- Node 4 has 0 connections.
- Node 5 has 2 connections.
- Node 6 has 2 connections.
- Node 8 has 1 connection.
- Node 3 has 4 connections.
- Node 7 has 5 connections.
- Node 1 has 4 connections.
- Node 9 has 3 connections.
- Node 2 has 4 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:
- For edge (0, 5): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (0, 7): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (1, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 3> is formed.
- For edge (1, 3): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (1, 7): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (1, 9): Triangle <1, 3, 9> is formed.
- For edge (2, 1): Triangle <1, 2, 3> is counted already.
- For edge (2, 3): Triangle <1, 2, 3> is counted already.
- For edge (2, 7): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (2, 9): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (3, 1): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (3, 2): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (3, 5): Triangle <1, 3, 5> is formed.
- For edge (3, 8): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (5, 0): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (5, 3): Triangle <1, 3, 5> is counted already.
- For edge (5, 7): Triangle <1, 5, 7> is formed.
- For edge (6, 7): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (6, 9): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (7, 0): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (7, 1): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (7, 2): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (7, 5): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (7, 6): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (7, 8): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (8, 3): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (8, 7): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (9, 1): Triangle <1, 3, 9> is counted already.
- For edge (9, 2): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (9, 6): No triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 5>, and <1, 5, 7>.
