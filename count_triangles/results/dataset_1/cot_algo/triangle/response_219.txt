Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 0: 7 connections
Node 4: 8 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) forms a triangle: <4, 5, 6>.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <4, 5, 6>.
