Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of vertices sorted by their degree:

0 (degree 3)
3 (degree 2)
5 (degree 1)
7 (degree 2)
9 (degree 3)
1 (degree 4)
2 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)

Next, we will identify the triangles in the given graph:

- Checking vertex 0:
  - Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with connections (0, 1, {6})
  - Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with connections (0, 6, {1})

- Checking vertex 3:
  - No triangles with vertex 3 as it doesn't have enough connections.

- Checking vertex 5:
  - No triangles with vertex 5.

- Checking vertex 7:
  - No triangles with vertex 7.

- Checking vertex 9:
  - Edge (9, 6) forms a triangle with connections (9, 6, {2})

- Checking vertex 1:
  - Edge (1, 0) has already been counted.
  - Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with connections (1, 2, {6})
  - Edge (1, 6) has already been counted.
  - Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with connections (1, 7, {0})

- Checking vertex 2:
  - Edge (2, 1) has already been counted.
  - Edge (2, 3) forms a triangle with connections (2, 3, {9})
  - Edge (2, 9) has already been counted.

- Checking vertex 6:
  - Edge (6, 1) has already been counted.
  - Edge (6, 9) has already been counted.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 6, 1>, <1, 2, 6>, and <1, 7, 0>.
