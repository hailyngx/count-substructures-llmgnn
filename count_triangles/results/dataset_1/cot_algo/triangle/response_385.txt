Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 1 connection
6: 2 connections
7: 1 connection
8: 2 connections
9: 3 connections

Now, we'll relabel the vertices accordingly based on their degree in ascending order:
0 -> 5
1 -> 7
2 -> 8
3 -> 9
4 -> 6
5 -> 1
6 -> 4
7 -> 2
8 -> 3
9 -> 0

Next, we will start counting the triangles using the degree-based ordering method. 
Since (0, 1) is an edge and 5 has fewer connections than 7, we will check for triangles involving vertex 5.

Checking for triangles involving vertex 5:
- (0, 1) shares a connection with 4
=> Triangle: <0, 1, 4>

Moving on to the next edge...

Since (0, 3) is an edge and 5 has fewer connections than 9, we will check for triangles involving vertex 5.

Checking for triangles involving vertex 5:
- (0, 3) doesn't form a triangle.

Moving on to the next edge...

Continuing this process, the total number of triangles found is [1].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>.
