Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels are as follows:
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 7 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 6
Node 2 has degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
