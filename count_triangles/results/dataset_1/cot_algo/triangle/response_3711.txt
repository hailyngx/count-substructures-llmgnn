Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 0: degree 6
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2

Based on the degree-based ordering, the triangles found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
