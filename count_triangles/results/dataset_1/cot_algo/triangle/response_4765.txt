Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the nodes are: 
(0) - 8 connections
(1) - 4 connections
(2) - 4 connections
(3) - 1 connection
(4) - 6 connections
(5) - 4 connections
(6) - 5 connections
(7) - 1 connection
(8) - 5 connections
(9) - 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check for triangles based on the edges provided.
Calculating the triangles, we find: 

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found:
