Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertices 7 and 1: 1 connection each
Vertices 8, 4, and 2: 2 connections each
Vertices 3 and 7: 3 connections each
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections

Now, let's go through the edges and count the triangles formed:
- Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle <0, 8, 5>.
- Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle <0, 9, 1>.
- Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle <1, 4, 7>.
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle given the ordering.
- Edge (2, 3) forms a triangle <2, 3, 6>.
- Edge (2, 6) forms a triangle <2, 6, 9>.
- Edge (3, 6) also forms a triangle <3, 6, 9>.
- Edge (4, 1) also forms a triangle <4, 1, 9>.
- Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle given the ordering.
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle given the ordering.
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle given the ordering.
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle given the ordering.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle given the ordering.
- Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle given the ordering.
- Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle given the ordering.
- Edge (8, 5) does not form a triangle given the ordering.
- Edge (9, 0) does not form a triangle given the ordering.
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle given the ordering.

Count of triangles: [4]
Triangles found: <0, 8, 5>, <0, 9, 1>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 6>
