Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections

Now, we will check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 3): Forms triangles with 1, 2, 4, 6
- Edge (0, 4): Forms triangles with 1, 2, 6
- Edge (0, 6): Forms a triangle with 3
- Edge (1, 2): Forms triangles with 3, 7
- Edge (1, 3): Forms a triangle with 2
- Edge (1, 7): Forms triangles with 4, 8
- Edge (2, 8): Forms a triangle with 4
- Edge (2, 9): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 7): Does not form a triangle

Counting the total number of triangles: [10]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
