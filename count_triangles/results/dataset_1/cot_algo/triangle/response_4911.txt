Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degree.

Sorted vertices with their degrees:
0 (2), 1 (2), 4 (1), 8 (1), 3 (2), 7 (4), 2 (3), 6 (4), 9 (1)

Now, we will traverse the edges following the rule that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Count of triangles: 4

Unique triangles: 
<2, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
