Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is:
Node 3 -> degree 1
Node 1 -> degree 2
Node 4 -> degree 2
Node 9 -> degree 2
Node 7 -> degree 3
Node 5 -> degree 4
Node 8 -> degree 4
Node 2 -> degree 6

Using the degree-based ordering method, we start counting the triangles:
1. (Node 1, Node 2) has a shared connection with Node 4 -> Triangle <1, 2, 4>
2. (Node 1, Node 4) has a shared connection with Node 2 -> Triangle <1, 4, 2>
3. (Node 1, Node 4) has a shared connection with Node 8 -> Triangle <1, 4, 8>
4. (Node 1, Node 2) has a shared connection with Node 5 -> Triangle <1, 2, 5>
5. (Node 1, Node 2) has a shared connection with Node 8 -> Triangle <1, 2, 8>
6. (Node 2, Node 5) has a shared connection with Node 8 -> Triangle <2, 5, 8>
7. (Node 2, Node 9) has a shared connection with Node 7 -> Triangle <2, 9, 7>
8. (Node 4, Node 8) has a shared connection with Node 5 -> Triangle <4, 8, 5>
9. (Node 5, Node 7) has shared connections with Node 2 and Node 8 -> Triangle <5, 7, 2>
10. (Node 5, Node 7) has shared connections with Node 8 and Node 9 -> Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total which are: 
<1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 9, 7>, <4, 8, 5>, <5, 7, 2>, <5, 7, 8>
