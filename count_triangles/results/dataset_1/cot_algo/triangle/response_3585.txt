Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we sort the nodes based on their degree:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we relabel the nodes:
Node 2 (0 connections) -> Node 1
Node 7 (0 connections) -> Node 2
Node 5 (1 connection) -> Node 3
Node 6 (1 connection) -> Node 4
Node 1 (1 connection) -> Node 5
Node 3 (2 connections) -> Node 6
Node 9 (2 connections) -> Node 7
Node 4 (3 connections) -> Node 8
Node 0 (3 connections) -> Node 9
Node 8 (5 connections) -> Node 10

We will now count the triangles:
- Edge between Node 0 and Node 4: Node 4 and Node 9 share a connection, forming a triangle with Node 0. Triangle <0, 4, 9>.
- Edge between Node 0 and Node 7: No triangles formed.
- Edge between Node 0 and Node 8: Node 0, Node 4, and Node 9 form a triangle. Triangle <0, 4, 9>.
- Edge between Node 3 and Node 6: No triangles formed.
- Edge between Node 3 and Node 8: Node 3, Node 6, and Node 8 form a triangle. Triangle <3, 6, 8>.
- Edge between Node 4 and Node 0: Ignored as Node 0 has a higher label.
- Edge between Node 4 and Node 9: Ignored as Node 4 has a higher label.
- Edge between Node 5 and Node 8: No triangles formed.
- Edge between Node 6 and Node 3: Node 3, Node 6, and Node 8 form a triangle. Triangle <3, 6, 8>.
- Edge between Node 7 and Node 0: No triangles formed.
- Edge between Node 8 and Node 0: Node 0, Node 4, and Node 9 form a triangle. Triangle <0, 4, 9>.
- Edge between Node 8 and Node 3: Node 3, Node 6, and Node 8 form a triangle. Triangle <3, 6, 8>.
- Edge between Node 8 and Node 5: No triangles formed.
- Edge between Node 8 and Node 9: Node 0, Node 4, and Node 9 form a triangle. Triangle <0, 4, 9>.
- Edge between Node 9 and Node 4: Ignored as Node 4 has a higher label.
- Edge between Node 9 and Node 8: Node 0, Node 4, and Node 9 form a triangle. Triangle <0, 4, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 8>
