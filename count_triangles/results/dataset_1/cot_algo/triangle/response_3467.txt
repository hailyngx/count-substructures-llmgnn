Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is: 2, 5, 7, 1, 6, 3, 8, 0, 4, 9.

By following the degree-based ordering method and considering edges where the vertex with lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles:

1. Edge (2, 4): Form triangle with vertex 5: <2, 4, 5>
2. Edge (5, 4): Form triangle with vertex 8: <4, 5, 8>
3. Edge (7, 8): Form triangle with vertex 5: <7, 8, 5>
4. Edge (7, 8): Form triangle with vertex 4: <7, 8, 4>
5. Edge (7, 8): Form triangle with vertex 7: <7, 8, 7>
6. Edge (0, 1): Form triangle with vertex 0: <0, 1, 7>
7. Edge (0, 1): Form triangle with vertex 3: <0, 1, 3>
8. Edge (1, 0): Form triangle with vertex 7: <1, 0, 7>
9. Edge (1, 7): Form triangle with vertex 7: <1, 7, 0>

So, there are a total of 9 triangles inside brackets [] in this graph.
