Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 1 has degree 0
Node 6 has degree 2
Nodes 7 and 9 have degree 2
Nodes 0, 4, 8 have degree 3
Nodes 3 and 5 have degree 4
Node 2 has degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 1 (degree 0) -> Node 0
Node 6 (degree 2) -> Node 1
Nodes 7 and 9 (degree 2) -> Node 2 and Node 3 (assign in increasing order of original labels)
Nodes 0, 4, 8 (degree 3) -> Node 4, Node 5, Node 6 (assign in increasing order of original labels)
Nodes 3 and 5 (degree 4) -> Node 7 and Node 8 (assign in increasing order of original labels)
Node 2 (degree 5) -> Node 9

Now, we will analyze each edge to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Proceed since Node 0 has fewer connections:
   - Shared connection: Node 6
2. Edge (0, 6): No action needed
3. Edge (2, 8): Proceed since Node 2 has fewer connections:
   - Shared connection: Node 4
4. Edge (2, 9): No action needed
5. Edge (3, 5): No action needed
6. Edge (3, 6): No action needed
7. Edge (3, 7): No action needed
8. Edge (4, 5): No action needed
9. Edge (4, 8): No action needed
10. Edge (5, 3): No action needed
11. Edge (5, 4): No action needed
12. Edge (5, 7): Proceed since Node 7 has fewer connections:
    - Shared connection: Node 3
13. Edge (6, 0): No action needed
14. Edge (6, 3): Proceed since Node 6 has fewer connections:
    - Shared connection: Node 7
15. Edge (7, 3): No action needed
16. Edge (7, 5): No action needed
17. Edge (8, 2): No action needed
18. Edge (8, 4): Proceed since Node 4 has fewer connections:
    - Shared connection: Node 5
19. Edge (9, 2): No action needed

No new triangles are found in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [0] and no unique triangles were found.
