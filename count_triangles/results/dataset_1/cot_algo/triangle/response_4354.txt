Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
0 - 2 connections
1 - 2 connections
2 - 2 connections
6 - 2 connections
8 - 2 connections
9 - 2 connections
3 - 3 connections
4 - 3 connections
5 - 3 connections
7 - 3 connections

Triangles found:
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 5>

Total number of triangles: [4]
