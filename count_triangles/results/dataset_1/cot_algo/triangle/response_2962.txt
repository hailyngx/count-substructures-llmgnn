Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 2 - 0, 0 - 1, 7 - 2, 3 - 3, 1 - 4, 8 - 5, 6 - 6, 9 - 7, 5 - 8, 4 - 9.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, when examining each edge, we will only consider the edges (0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 7), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 9), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 1), (8, 0), (8, 6), (9, 4), (9, 6).

By checking for shared connections for each pair of vertices connected by an edge, we find the following triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
