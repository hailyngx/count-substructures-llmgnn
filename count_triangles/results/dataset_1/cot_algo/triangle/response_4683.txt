Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 3: 7 connections
Node 7: 7 connections

Relabeling the vertices based on their connections:

Node 1 -> A (2 connections)
Node 4 -> B (2 connections)
Node 5 -> C (2 connections)
Node 0 -> D (3 connections)
Node 2 -> E (3 connections)
Node 6 -> F (4 connections)
Node 8 -> G (4 connections)
Node 9 -> H (6 connections)
Node 3 -> I (7 connections)
Node 7 -> J (7 connections)

Now we check each edge using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

(1, 2) -> A and E share 0 connections
(1, 3) -> A and I share 0 connections
(1, 8) -> A and G share 0 connections
(2, 1) -> E and A share 0 connections
(2, 9) -> E and H share 0 connections
(3, 1) -> I and A share 0 connections
(3, 6) -> I and F share 0 connections
(3, 7) -> I and J share 0 connections
(3, 8) -> I and G share 0 connections
(4, 6) -> B and F share 0 connections
(5, 6) -> C and F share 0 connections
(6, 3) -> F and I share 0 connections
(6, 4) -> F and B share 0 connections
(6, 5) -> F and C share 0 connections
(7, 0) -> J and D share 0 connections
(7, 3) -> J and I share 0 connections
(7, 8) -> J and G share 0 connections
(7, 9) -> J and H share 0 connections
(8, 1) -> G and A share 0 connections
(8, 3) -> G and I share 0 connections
(8, 7) -> G and J share 0 connections
(9, 0) -> H and D share 1 connection (via node 7)
(9, 2) -> H and E share 0 connections
(9, 4) -> H and B share 0 connections
(9, 5) -> H and C share 0 connections
(9, 7) -> H and J share 1 connection (via node 0)

There are 2 triangles found in the graph:

1. <7, 0, 9>
2. <7, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
