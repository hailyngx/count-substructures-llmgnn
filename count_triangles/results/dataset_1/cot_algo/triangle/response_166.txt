Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections they have. The sorted vertices are as follows:
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Nodes 0, 2, 7: 3 connections
Nodes 1, 3: 5 connections
Nodes 5, 8, 9: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the order specified in the question:

(0, 1): Nodes 6 and 4 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(0, 5): Nodes 6 and 4 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(0, 8): Nodes 6 and 4 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(1, 0): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(1, 2): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(1, 4): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(1, 7): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(1, 8): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(1, 9): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(2, 1): Nodes 6 and 4 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(2, 3): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(2, 8): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(3, 2): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(3, 5): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(3, 7): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(3, 9): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(4, 1): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(4, 5): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(5, 0): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(5, 3): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(5, 4): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(5, 8): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(5, 9): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(7, 1): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(7, 3): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(7, 9): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(8, 0): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(8, 1): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(8, 2): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(8, 5): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(8, 9): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(9, 1): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(9, 3): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(9, 5): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(9, 7): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.
(9, 8): Nodes 4 and 6 can't form a triangle with this edge.

Therefore, there are no triangles in this graph. 
Output: [0]
