Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on the number of connections in ascending order: 

Vertices: 5, 7, 4, 1, 7, 3, 6, 1, 2, 4

Now, we relabel the vertices starting from 0 to 9 based on the sorting:

New Labels: 
5 -> 0
7 -> 1
4 -> 2
1 -> 3
7 -> 4
3 -> 5
6 -> 6
1 -> 7
2 -> 8
4 -> 9

Now, we check the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Edges to Consider: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 9), (6, 8), (6, 9), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 7)

Counting the triangles formed by these edges, we get the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 9, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 9, 7>, <6, 8, 5>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 7>, <8, 5, 6>, <8, 6, 9>, <9, 7, 1>

Total number of triangles: [15]
