Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 8 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles: 

We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Analyzing the edges:
Edge (0, 6) - No triangles
Edge (0, 9) - No triangles
Edge (1, 3) - Forms a triangle <1, 3, 7>
Edge (1, 5) - Forms a triangle <1, 5, 7>
Edge (1, 7) - Forms a triangle <1, 3, 7> and <1, 5, 7>
Edge (2, 7) - Forms a triangle <2, 7, 3>
Edge (2, 9) - No triangles
Edge (3, 7) - Forms a triangle <1, 3, 7> and <2, 7, 3> and <3, 4, 7> and <3, 5, 7>
Edge (4, 5) - Forms a triangle <1, 5, 7>
Edge (4, 7) - Forms a triangle <1, 3, 7> and <3, 4, 7> and <4, 5, 7>
Edge (5, 7) - Forms a triangle <1, 5, 7> and <3, 5, 7> and <4, 5, 7>
Edge (6, 7) - No triangles
Edge (7, 8) - No triangles
Edge (9, 0) - No triangles
Edge (9, 2) - No triangles
Edge (9, 3) - Forms a triangle <1, 3, 7> and <2, 7, 3> and <3, 4, 7> and <3, 5, 7>
Edge (9, 4) - Forms a triangle <1, 3, 7> and <3, 4, 7> and <4, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 3>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>
