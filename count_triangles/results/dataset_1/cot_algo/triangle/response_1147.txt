Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. 

Here is the list of vertices sorted by their degrees:
Vertex 1 (1 connection): 5
Vertex 2 (2 connections): 1, 6, 7, 9
Vertex 3 (3 connections): 3, 4
Vertex 4 (4 connections): 0, 8
Vertex 5 (5 connections): 2

Now, we will count the triangles by following the method described earlier: 
- Start with the vertex with the lowest degree (Vertex 1).
- Proceed through the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <2, 3, 5>

Total number of triangles: [4]
