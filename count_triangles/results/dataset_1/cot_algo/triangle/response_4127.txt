Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

The vertices labeled by their degree in ascending order are:
Node 6 (degree 2)
Node 0 (degree 2)
Node 1 (degree 2)
Node 5 (degree 3)
Node 2 (degree 3)
Node 9 (degree 4)
Node 4 (degree 4)
Node 7 (degree 5)
Node 8 (degree 5)
Node 3 (degree 6)

After sorting the vertices and enforcing the rule for the edge (i, j) where i < j, we find the following triangles:

1. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 8>
7. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
8. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
9. Triangle <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
