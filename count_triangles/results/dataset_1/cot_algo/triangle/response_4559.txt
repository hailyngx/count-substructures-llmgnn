Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0 has 1 connection
- Node 4 has 1 connection
- Node 6 has 1 connection
- Node 5 has 2 connections
- Node 2 has 2 connections
- Node 3 has 2 connections
- Node 7 has 3 connections
- Node 1 has 4 connections
- Node 8 has 4 connections
- Node 9 has 8 connections

Based on the given edges and the labels of the vertices, we can count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 3]

Unique triangles:
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
