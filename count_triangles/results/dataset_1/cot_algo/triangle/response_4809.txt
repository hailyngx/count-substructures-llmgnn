Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices:  
1. 1 (degree 2)
2. 4 (degree 2)
3. 5 (degree 1)
4. 6 (degree 2)
5. 8 (degree 0)
6. 0 (degree 3)
7. 3 (degree 2)
8. 7 (degree 4)
9. 9 (degree 4)
10. 2 (degree 4)

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices:  
1. 8 (degree 0)
2. 3 (degree 1)
3. 1 (degree 2)
4. 4 (degree 2)
5. 6 (degree 2)
6. 0 (degree 3)
7. 2 (degree 4)
8. 7 (degree 4)
9. 9 (degree 4)
10. 5 (degree 1)

Now, we will count the triangles.  

There are [5] triangles in the given graph.  

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 2, 7>  
<0, 2, 9>  
<0, 7, 4>  
<2, 7, 4>  
<2, 7, 9>
