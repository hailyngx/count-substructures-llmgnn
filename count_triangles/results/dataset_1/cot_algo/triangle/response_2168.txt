Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
0 (degree 4), 9 (degree 2), 7 (degree 3), 6 (degree 3), 5 (degree 3), 2 (degree 4), 4 (degree 5), 8 (degree 4), 1 (degree 4), 3 (degree 5).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Checking edge (0, 1): Both 0 and 1 have 4 connections. They share nodes 3 and 5, forming a triangle with 3. 
2. Checking edge (0, 3): Node 0 has 4 connections while node 3 has 5 connections. They share nodes 1 and 2, forming another triangle with 1 and 2.
3. Checking edge (0, 5): Node 0 has 4 connections while node 5 has 3 connections. They share node 2, forming a triangle with 2.
4. Checking edge (0, 7): Node 0 has 4 connections while node 7 has 3 connections. They share node 4, forming a triangle with 4.
5. Checking edge (1, 3): Already counted in step 1.
6. Checking edge (1, 4): Node 1 has 4 connections while node 4 has 5 connections. They share nodes 2 and 8, forming another triangle with 2 and 8.
7. Checking edge (1, 9): Node 1 has 4 connections while node 9 has 2 connections. They share no new triangles.
8. Checking edge (2, 3): Already counted in step 2.
9. Checking edge (2, 4): Already counted in step 6.
10. Checking edge (2, 5): Already counted in step 3.
11. Checking edge (2, 6): Node 2 has 4 connections while node 6 has 3 connections. They share nodes 4 and 5, forming another triangle with 4 and 5.
12. Checking edge (3, 8): Node 3 has 5 connections while node 8 has 4 connections. They share nodes 4 and 9, forming another triangle with 4 and 9.
13. Checking edge (4, 6): Already counted in step 11.
14. Checking edge (4, 7): Already counted in step 4.
15. Checking edge (4, 8): Already counted in step 12.
16. Checking edge (5, 6): Already counted in step 11.
17. Checking edge (6, 7): Nodes 6 and 7 have 3 connections each. They share no new triangles.
18. Checking edge (6, 5): Already counted in step 11.
19. Checking edge (7, 8): Already counted in step 12.
20. Checking edge (8, 9): Node 8 has 4 connections while node 9 has 2 connections. They share node 1, forming a triangle with 1.
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].

The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 7, 4>, <1, 4, 2>, <2, 6, 4>, <3, 8, 4>, <8, 9, 1>.
