Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
2 -> 1 connection
6 -> 2 connections
5 -> 2 connections
0 -> 2 connections
4 -> 3 connections
7 -> 4 connections
1 -> 4 connections
8 -> 5 connections
3 -> 5 connections

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph and count the number of triangles formed:

(0, 6): No triangles
(0, 8): No triangles
(1, 3): No triangles
(1, 4): No triangles
(1, 8): No triangles
(2, 7): No triangles
(3, 1): No triangles
(3, 4): No triangles
(3, 7): No triangles
(3, 8): No triangles
(4, 1): No triangles
(4, 3): No triangles
(4, 5): No triangles
(5, 4): No triangles
(5, 8): No triangles
(6, 0): No triangles
(6, 7): No triangles
(7, 2): No triangles
(7, 3): No triangles
(7, 6): No triangles
(8, 0): No triangles
(8, 1): No triangles
(8, 3): Triangle found: <1, 3, 8>
(8, 5): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <1, 3, 8>.
