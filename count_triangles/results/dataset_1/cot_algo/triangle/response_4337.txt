Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels are: 1(1), 4(2), 7(3), 9(4), 8(5), 3(6), 2(7), 6(8), 0(9).

Using these labels, we can now go through each edge to count the number of triangles formed. 

The triangles found are: 
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 7>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
