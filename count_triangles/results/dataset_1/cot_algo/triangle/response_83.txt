Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 1
- Vertex 2: degree 1
- Vertex 3: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 5
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Vertex 0 (degree 2) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 1 (degree 1) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 2 (degree 1) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 3 (degree 1) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 4 (degree 5) -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 5 (degree 2) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 6 (degree 2) -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 7 (degree 2) -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 8 (degree 3) -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 9 (degree 5) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will list the triangles (numbered by the lowest labeled vertex) we find using the edge list provided:

<0, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
