Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are:  

Vertices:
1. 9 (degree 1)
2. 2 (degree 1)
3. 0 (degree 2)
4. 1 (degree 2)
5. 8 (degree 2)
6. 5 (degree 3)
7. 7 (degree 3)
8. 3 (degree 4)
9. 4 (degree 4)
10. 6 (degree 6)

Based on the degree-based ordering, we can start counting the triangles.

Triangles:
1. <0, 6, 1>
2. <0, 6, 5>
3. <1, 6, 5>
4. <3, 4, 7>
5. <4, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [5]
