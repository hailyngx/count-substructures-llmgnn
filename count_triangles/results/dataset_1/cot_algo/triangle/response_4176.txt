Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph with a Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 4: 1 connection
Nodes 1, 3, 9: 2 connections
Nodes 6, 8: 3 connections
Nodes 5, 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

We will now relabel the vertices accordingly:

Node 4: 1
Nodes 1, 3, 9: 2, 3, 4
Nodes 6, 8: 5, 6
Nodes 5, 7: 7, 8
Node 2: 9

Next, we will go through each edge to count the number of triangles. Since we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will only look at these edges:

(1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 5), (4, 6), (7, 9)

Now, calculating the triangles formed by these edges:

- Triangle <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
