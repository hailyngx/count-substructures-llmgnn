Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 8: degree 1
Node 9: degree 1
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, we can count the number of triangles present in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [5].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 4>, <2, 1, 3>, <2, 3, 7>.
