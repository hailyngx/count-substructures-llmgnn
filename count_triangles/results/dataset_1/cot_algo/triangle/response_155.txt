Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of nodes is as follows:
Node 1: 1 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 2)
(1, 3)
(5, 6)
(5, 7)
(3, 5)
(6, 7)
(0, 8)
(0, 9)
(2, 4)
(2, 8)
(2, 9)
(4, 9)

There are 4 triangles in the graph, which are:
<2, 0, 8>
<2, 0, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
