Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices will be:
Vertices: 7, 0, 1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 8, 9, 2

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Examining the edges in this order:
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 3), (8, 9)

Counting the triangles formed by the above edges:
Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
