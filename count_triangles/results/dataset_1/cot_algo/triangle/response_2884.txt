Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are reordered based on their degrees:
Vertex 0 has degree 1
Vertex 5 has degree 0
Vertices 2 and 5 have degree 2
Vertices 3 and 7 have degree 2
Vertices 4 and 6 have degree 2
Vertices 1, 8, and 9 have degree 3

The edges will be considered in the order: (0, 1), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 8), (3, 9), (4, 7), (4, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 9)

Calculating the triangles:

For edge (0, 1): No triangles.

For edge (1, 6): No triangles.

For edge (1, 9): Triangle <1, 6, 9>

For edge (2, 3): No triangles.

For edge (2, 8): No triangles.

For edge (3, 9): No triangles.

For edge (4, 7): No triangles.

For edge (4, 9): Triangle <4, 1, 9>

For edge (6, 8): No triangles.

For edge (7, 8): No triangles.

For edge (8, 9): No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles: <1, 6, 9>, <4, 1, 9>
