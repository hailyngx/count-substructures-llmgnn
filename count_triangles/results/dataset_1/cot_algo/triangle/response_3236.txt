Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we can relabel them as follows:
- Vertex 0 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 1 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 7 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 6 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 9 (Degree 1)
- Vertex 8 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 4 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 2 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 5 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 3 (Not present, as it has degree 0)

Now, we can count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between vertices with lower labels.

Based on the given edges, the total number of triangles is [7].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 1>
<1, 2, 0>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
