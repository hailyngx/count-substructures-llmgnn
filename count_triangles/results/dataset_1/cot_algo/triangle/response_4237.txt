Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
1. Vertex 5 (degree 0)
2. Vertex 1 (degree 1)
3. Vertex 3 (degree 1)
4. Vertex 7 (degree 1)
5. Vertex 9 (degree 1)
6. Vertex 8 (degree 1)
7. Vertex 4 (degree 2)
8. Vertex 6 (degree 3)
9. Vertex 2 (degree 4)
10. Vertex 0 (degree 6)

Now, we can count the triangles by following the given edges:

1. Edge (0, 2): Forms a triangle with vertex 4. <0, 2, 4>
2. Edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 6. <0, 4, 6>
3. Edge (0, 6): Forms a triangle with vertex 4. <0, 4, 6>
4. Edge (1, 3): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (2, 0): Triangle already counted in edge (0, 2).
6. Edge (2, 8): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 9): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (3, 1): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (4, 0): Triangle already counted in edge (0, 4).
10. Edge (4, 6): Triangle already counted in edge (0, 4).
11. Edge (6, 0): Triangle already counted in edge (0, 6).
12. Edge (6, 4): Triangle already counted in edge (0, 6) and (4, 6).
13. Edge (6, 7): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (7, 6): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (8, 2): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (9, 2): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>.
