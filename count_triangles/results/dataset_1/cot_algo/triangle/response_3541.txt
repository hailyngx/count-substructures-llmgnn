Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly, the new order is: 

0 (degree 3) <br>
2 (degree 3) <br>
5 (degree 3) <br>
4 (degree 4) <br>
6 (degree 4) <br>
9 (degree 4) <br>
8 (degree 5) <br>
3 (degree 5) <br>
1 (degree 6) <br>

Now, we will go through each edge in the order given and count the number of triangles:

Edge (0, 1): forms 1 triangle <0, 1, 5> 

Edge (0, 5): forms 1 triangle <0, 5, 1> 

Edge (0, 8): does not form triangles

Edge (1, 3): forms 1 triangle <1, 3, 4> 

Edge (1, 4): forms 1 triangle <1, 4, 6>

Edge (1, 5): forms 1 triangle <1, 5, 9> 

Edge (1, 8): does not form triangles

Edge (2, 3): forms 1 triangle <2, 3, 6> 

Edge (3, 6): forms 1 triangle <3, 6, 4> 

Edge (3, 9): does not form triangles

Edge (4, 6): forms 1 triangle <4, 6, 8> 

Edge (5, 9): forms 1 triangle <5, 9, 1>

There are 9 triangles in total inside brackets: [9].
