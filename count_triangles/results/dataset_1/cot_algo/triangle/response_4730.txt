Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree from least to most, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Vertex 7 with degree 2
- Vertex 0 with degree 2
- Vertex 5 with degree 2
- Vertex 3 with degree 3
- Vertex 1 with degree 3
- Vertex 9 with degree 3
- Vertex 4 with degree 4
- Vertex 8 with degree 4
- Vertex 6 with degree 6
- Vertex 2 with degree 6

Now, we will go through each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 6): Forms triangle with vertex 1 as <0, 6, 1>
- Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed
- Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 4): Forms triangle with vertex 5 as <2, 4, 5>
- Edge (2, 9): Forms triangle with vertex 6 as <2, 9, 6>
- Edge (3, 5): No triangle formed
- Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed
- Edge (4, 8): Forms triangle with vertex 6 as <4, 8, 6>
- Edge (5, 3): No triangle formed
- Edge (6, 0): No triangle formed
- Edge (6, 1): No triangle formed
- Edge (7, 1): No triangle formed
- Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 4): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 6): Forms triangle with vertex 7 as <8, 6, 7>
- Edge (9, 2): Forms triangle with vertex 4 as <9, 2, 4>
- Edge (9, 6): Forms triangle with vertex 8 as <9, 6, 8>
- Edge (9, 7): No triangle formed

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 6, 1>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 9, 6>, <4, 8, 6>
