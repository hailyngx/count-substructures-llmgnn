Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following labeling:
- Node 9 (degree 1)
- Node 5 (degree 2)
- Node 4 (degree 2)
- Node 7 (degree 2)
- Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 8 (degree 3)
- Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 6)
- Node 3 (degree 6)

We will now go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge (0, 2):
   Shared connections with nodes 0 and 2 are node 6.
   Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>

2. Edge (0, 6):
   Shared connections with nodes 0 and 6 are nodes 2 and 7.
   Triangles formed: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 7>

3. Edge (0, 7):
   No triangles formed.

4. Edge (1, 3):
   No triangles formed.

5. Edge (1, 4):
   No triangles formed.

6. Edge (1, 6):
   Shared connections with nodes 1 and 6 are nodes 0 and 3.
   Triangle formed: <0, 1, 6>

7. Edge (1, 8):
   No triangles formed.

8. Edge (2, 0):
   No triangles formed.

9. Edge (2, 3):
   Shared connections with nodes 2 and 3 are nodes 0 and 6.
   Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>

10. Edge (2, 5):
    Shared connections with nodes 2 and 5 are nodes 4 and 6.
    Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>

    Shared connections with nodes 3 and 2 are nodes 0 and 6.
    Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>

13. Edge (3, 6):
    Shared connections with nodes 3 and 6 are nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    Triangles formed: <0, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 6>

14. Edge (3, 8):
    No triangles formed.

15. Edge (4, 1):
    No triangles formed.

16. Edge (4, 5):
    Shared connections with nodes 4 and 5 are nodes 2 and 6.
    Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>

17. Edge (4, 9):
    No triangles formed.

18. Edge (5, 2):
    Shared connections with nodes 5 and 2 are nodes 4 and 6.
    Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>

19. Edge (5, 4):
    Shared connections with nodes 5 and 4 are node 2.
    Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>

20. Edge (5, 6):
    Shared connections with nodes 5 and 6 are nodes 0 and 2.
    Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>

21. Edge (6, 0):
    Shared connections with nodes 6 and 0 are nodes 2 and 7.
    Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>

22. Edge (6, 1):
    Shared connections with nodes 6 and 1 are nodes 0 and 3.
    Triangles formed: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 3, 6>

23. Edge (6, 3):
    Shared connections with nodes 6 and 3 are nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    Triangles formed: <0, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 6>

24. Edge (6, 5):
    Shared connections with nodes 6 and 5 are nodes 0 and 2.
    Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>

25. Edge (6, 7):
    Shared connections with nodes 6 and 7 are node 0.
    Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>

26. Edge (6, 8):
    Shared connections with nodes 6 and 8 are nodes 1 and 3.
    Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>

27. Edge (7, 0):
    No triangles formed.

28. Edge (7, 6):
    Shared connections with nodes 7 and 6 are node 0.
    Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>

29. Edge (8, 1):
    No triangles formed.

30. Edge (8, 3):
    No triangles formed.

31. Edge (8, 6):
    Shared connections with nodes 8 and 6 are nodes 1 and 3.
    Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>

32. Edge (9, 4):
    No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
