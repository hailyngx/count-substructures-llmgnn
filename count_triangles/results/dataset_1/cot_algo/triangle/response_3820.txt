Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph after sorting the vertices based on their degree is as follows:

Vertices: 1, 3, 0, 2, 8, 6, 4, 5, 9, 7

Edges in the updated order: (1, 3), (0, 7), (0, 3), (2, 9), (7, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 9), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

Number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles:
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
