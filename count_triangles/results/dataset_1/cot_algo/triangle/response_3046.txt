Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  
Node 7: connections [2]  
Node 4: connections [2]  
Node 5: connections [4]  
Node 3: connections [5]  
Node 8: connections [5]  
Node 6: connections [5]  
Node 1: connections [5]  
Node 9: connections [5]  
Node 2: connections [6]  
Node 0: connections [7]  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we iterate through the edges while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. By doing so, we can identify the triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles inside brackets is [10].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 2, 8>  
<0, 2, 9>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<0, 5, 9>  
<2, 6, 8>  
<2, 6, 9>  
<2, 8, 6>  
<2, 8, 9>  
<4, 5, 7>  
<4, 7, 5>
