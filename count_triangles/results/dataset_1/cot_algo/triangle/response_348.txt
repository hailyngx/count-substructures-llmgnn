Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labels are:

Node 5 - 0 connections
Node 1 - 1 connection
Node 3 - 1 connection
Node 7 - 2 connections
Node 9 - 2 connections
Node 2 - 3 connections
Node 6 - 3 connections
Node 0 - 4 connections
Node 4 - 5 connections
Node 8 - 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine each edge in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 both have 4 connections. Since the vertex with the lower label (Node 0) does not have fewer connections, we cannot proceed.
2. Edge (0, 8): Node 0 has 4 connections, and Node 8 has 5 connections. Since Node 0 has fewer connections, we can proceed. Nodes 0, 4, and 8 form a triangle: <0, 4, 8>.
3. Edge (1, 7): Node 1 and Node 7 both have 2 connections. Since the vertex with the lower label (Node 1) does not have fewer connections, we cannot proceed.
4. Edge (2, 3): Node 2 has 3 connections, and Node 3 has 1 connection. We can proceed. No triangle is formed.
5. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 has 3 connections, and Node 4 has 5 connections. We can proceed. No triangle is formed.
6. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 has 3 connections, and Node 7 has 2 connections. We can proceed. No triangle is formed.
7. Edge (3, 2): Node 3 and Node 2 were already analyzed.
8. Edge (4, 0): Node 0 and Node 4 were already analyzed.
9. Edge (4, 2): Node 2 and Node 4 were already analyzed.
10. Edge (4, 6): Node 4 has 5 connections, and Node 6 has 3 connections. We can proceed. No triangle is formed.
11. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 has 5 connections, and Node 8 has 5 connections. Since both have the same number of connections, we cannot proceed.
12. Edge (5, 8): Node 5 and Node 8 both have 0 connections. Since the vertex with the lower label (Node 5) does not have fewer connections, we cannot proceed.
13. Edge (6, 4): Node 4 and Node 6 were already analyzed.
14. Edge (6, 8): Node 6 has 3 connections, and Node 8 has 5 connections. We can proceed. No triangle is formed.
15. Edge (6, 9): Node 6 has 3 connections, and Node 9 has 2 connections. We can proceed. No triangle is formed.
16. Edge (7, 1): Node 1 and Node 7 were already analyzed.
17. Edge (7, 2): Node 2 and Node 7 were already analyzed.
18. Edge (8, 0): Node 0 and Node 8 were already analyzed.
19. Edge (8, 4): Node 4 and Node 8 were already analyzed.
20. Edge (8, 5): Node 5 and Node 8 were already analyzed.
21. Edge (8, 6): Node 6 and Node 8 were already analyzed.
22. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 has 5 connections, and Node 9 has 2 connections. We can proceed. No triangle is formed.
23. Edge (9, 6): Node 6 and Node 9 were already analyzed.
24. Edge (9, 8): Node 8 and Node 9 were already analyzed.

There is a total of [1] triangle in this graph, which is <0, 4, 8>.
