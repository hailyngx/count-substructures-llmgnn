Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 0 has 3 connections
Vertex 5 has 1 connection
Vertex 7 has 2 connections
Vertex 6 has 4 connections
Vertex 2 has 3 connections
Vertex 4 has 4 connections
Vertex 8 has 3 connections
Vertex 1 has 3 connections
Vertex 3 has 3 connections
Vertex 9 has 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles:
- For the edge (0, 1), we check for shared connections: (0, 1, 5)
- For the edge (0, 5), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (0, 7), we check for shared connections: (0, 7, 3)
- For the edge (1, 6), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (1, 8), we check for shared connections: (1, 8, 2)
- For the edge (2, 3), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (2, 4), we check for shared connections: (2, 4, 6)
- For the edge (2, 8), we check for shared connections: (2, 8, 1)
- For the edge (3, 7), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (3, 9), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (4, 6), we check for shared connections: (4, 6, 9)
- For the edge (4, 8), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (5, 0), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (6, 1), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (6, 4), we check for shared connections: (6, 4, 9)
- For the edge (6, 9), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (7, 0), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (7, 3), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (8, 1), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (8, 2), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (8, 4), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (9, 3), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (9, 4), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (9, 6), no triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 7, 3>, <1, 8, 2>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 1>.
