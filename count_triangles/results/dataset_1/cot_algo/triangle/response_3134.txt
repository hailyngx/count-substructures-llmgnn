Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following list: 

Node 1 (degree 2): 3, 6 <br>
Node 2 (degree 2): 4, 8 <br>
Node 3 (degree 2): 5, 9 <br>
Node 4 (degree 2): 0, 7 <br>
Node 5 (degree 2): 2 <br>

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles. 

After examining the given graph, we find that there are 4 triangles.

The triangles are: 
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 6, 7>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
