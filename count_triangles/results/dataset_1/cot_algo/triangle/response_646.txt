Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 4, 1, 7, 8, 2, 5, 3, 9, 6, 0
Relabeling the vertices accordingly:
4 -> 0
1 -> 1
7 -> 2
8 -> 3
2 -> 4
5 -> 5
3 -> 6
9 -> 7
6 -> 8
0 -> 9

The edges that satisfy the condition (vertex with lower label has fewer connections) are:
(0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 7), (7, 9)

Counting the triangles formed by these edges:
[Total number of triangles: 7]

Unique triangles: <1, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>
