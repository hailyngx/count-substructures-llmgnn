Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:  
0 (degree 2), 1 (degree 1), 2 (degree 1), 3 (degree 2), 4 (degree 1), 5 (degree 2), 6 (degree 2), 7 (degree 1), 8 (degree 1), 9 (degree 1).

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges using the degree-based ordering method:

1. Edge: (1, 0) - Proceed because 1 has fewer connections than 0. Shared connections with 0: None.
2. Edge: (2, 0) - Proceed because 2 has fewer connections than 0. Shared connections with 0: None.
3. Edge: (3, 6) - Proceed because 3 has fewer connections than 6. Shared connections with 6: None.
4. Edge: (3, 7) - Proceed because 3 has fewer connections than 7. Shared connections with 7: None.
5. Edge: (4, 5) - Proceed because 4 has fewer connections than 5. Shared connections with 5: None.
6. Edge: (5, 9) - Proceed because 5 has fewer connections than 9. Shared connections with 9: None.
7. Edge: (6, 8) - Proceed because 6 has fewer connections than 8. Shared connections with 8: None.
