Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 2 has 1 connection.
Nodes 5 and 6 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 0 and 5 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 1 and 3 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 4, 8, and 7 have 6 connections each.

Now, let's relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 2 -> A
Node 5 -> B
Node 6 -> C
Node 0 -> D
Node 5 -> E
Node 1 -> F
Node 3 -> G
Node 4 -> H
Node 8 -> I
Node 7 -> J

Now, we will check for triangles:

- (A, G) -> No triangle
- (B, G) -> <B, G, C>
- (C, G) -> No triangle
- (D, I) -> No triangle
- (E, G) -> No triangle
- (F, H) -> No triangle
- (G, H) -> <G, H, F>
- (H, F) -> <H, F, I>
- (I, H) -> No triangle
- (J, F) -> <J, F, G>
- (B, H) -> No triangle
- (G, B) -> <G, B, J>
- (C, J) -> <C, J, D>
- (D, B) -> No triangle
- (E, J) -> No triangle
- (F, J) -> <F, J, H>
- (G, J) -> <G, J, I>
- (H, J) -> No triangle
- (I, J) -> <I, J, F>

The total number of triangles is [6] inside brackets. The unique triangles found are <B, G, C>, <G, H, F>, <H, F, I>, <J, F, G>, <G, B, J>, and <I, J, F>.
