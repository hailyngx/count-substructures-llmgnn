Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 2 - 1 connection
Vertex 9 - 1 connection
Vertex 4 - 1 connection
Vertex 1 - 2 connections
Vertex 5 - 3 connections
Vertex 7 - 3 connections
Vertex 3 - 3 connections
Vertex 6 - 4 connections
Vertex 8 - 6 connections
Vertex 0 - 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 6) can form a triangle with shared connections 3, 4 resulting in <0, 3, 4>.
- Edge (0, 7) can form a triangle with shared connections 5 resulting in <0, 5, 7>.
- Edge (0, 8) can form a triangle with shared connections 5 resulting in <0, 5, 8>.
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 8 has a higher label.
- Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 6 has a higher label.
- Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 8 has a higher label.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (6, 0) can form a triangle with shared connections 3, 4 resulting in <0, 3, 4>.
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (7, 0) can form a triangle with shared connections 5 resulting in <0, 5, 7>.
- Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (8, 0) can form a triangle with shared connections 5 resulting in <0, 5, 8>.
- Edge (8, 1) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 5 has a higher label.
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (8, 5) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.
- Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle as the shared connection 0 has a higher label.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
