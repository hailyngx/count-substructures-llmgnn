Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. The vertices are relabeled as follows:
- Vertex 0 has degree 4
- Vertex 1 has degree 2
- Vertex 2 has degree 5
- Vertex 3 has degree 3
- Vertex 4 has degree 5
- Vertex 5 has degree 4
- Vertex 6 has degree 5
- Vertex 7 has degree 3
- Vertex 8 has degree 1
- Vertex 9 has degree 2

Next, we will look at each edge starting from the edge with the vertex of lower degree to calculate the number of triangles.

Considering the edges:
1. (1, 2): No triangle formed.
2. (1, 6): No triangle formed.
3. (1, 9): No triangle formed.
4. (3, 2): No triangle formed.
5. (5, 8): No triangle formed.
6. (9, 0): No triangle formed.
7. (9, 1): No triangle formed.
8. (0, 4): Triangle <0, 2, 4> is formed.
9. (0, 5): Triangle <0, 2, 5> is formed.
10. (0, 6): Triangle <0, 1, 6> is formed.
11. (0, 9): No triangle formed.
12. (2, 1): No triangle formed.
13. (2, 3): No triangle formed.
14. (2, 4): Triangle <0, 2, 4> is counted.
15. (2, 5): Triangle <0, 2, 5> is counted.
16. (2, 7): No triangle formed.
17. (3, 4): Triangle <0, 2, 4> is counted.
18. (3, 5): Triangle <0, 2, 5> is counted.
19. (4, 0): Triangle <0, 2, 4> is counted.
20. (4, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 4> is counted.
21. (4, 3): Triangle <0, 2, 4> is counted.
22. (4, 6): Triangle <0, 1, 6> is counted.
23. (4, 7): No triangle formed.
24. (5, 0): Triangle <0, 2, 5> is counted.
25. (5, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 5> is counted.
26. (5, 3): Triangle <0, 2, 5> is counted.
27. (5, 6): Triangle <0, 1, 6> is counted.
28. (6, 0): Triangle <0, 1, 6> is counted.
29. (6, 1): Triangle <0, 1, 6> is counted.
30. (6, 4): Triangle <0, 1, 6> is counted.
31. (6, 5): Triangle <0, 1, 6> is counted.
32. (6, 7): No triangle formed.
33. (7, 2): No triangle formed.
34. (7, 4): No triangle formed.
35. (7, 6): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 5>
