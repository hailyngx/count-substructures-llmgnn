Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, we can relabel the vertices as follows:
Node 5 (Degree 3)
Node 6 (Degree 3)
Node 9 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 4)
Node 4 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 7 (Degree 5)
Node 2 (Degree 5)
Node 3 (Degree 5)
Node 5 and 6 are connected.
Node 6 and 7 are connected.
Node 6 and 8 are connected.
Node 6 and 9 are connected.
Node 1 and 2 are connected.
Node 2 and 3 are connected.
Node 2 and 7 are connected.
Node 2 and 8 are connected.
Node 2 and 9 are connected.
Node 4 and 9 are connected.
Node 4 and 9 are connected.
Node 0 and 3 are connected.
Node 0 and 8 are connected.
Node 0 and 9 are connected.

By counting the triangles formed by these connections, we find the following:
Triangles: 
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
