Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices is as follows:
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 7:Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 0
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 7

Now, we will count the number of triangles based on the sorted order of the vertices:
- For node 6: No triangles can be formed.
- For node 5: No triangles can be formed.
- For node 1: No triangles can be formed.
- For node 7: No triangles can be formed.
- For node 4: No triangles can be formed.
- For node 0: Possible triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 8>
- For node 9: Possible triangles: <2, 9, 3>
- For node 8: Possible triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <2, 8, 6>
- For node 3: Possible triangles: <2, 3, 7>, <3, 7, 2>, <3, 9, 2>, <3, 9, 7>
- For node 2: Possible triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 0>, <2, 7, 3>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 2>, <2, 8, 6>, <2, 9, 3>, <3, 7, 2>

Counting the total number of triangles, we get 10 triangles in total inside brackets: [10].
