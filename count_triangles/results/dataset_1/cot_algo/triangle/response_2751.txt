Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 9: 8 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 1): Forms a triangle with node 7 - <0, 1, 7>
2. Edge (0, 7): No triangles as both nodes already have 2 connections
3. Edge (1, 2): Forms a triangle with node 6 - <1, 2, 6>
4. Edge (1, 4): Forms a triangle with node 6 - <1, 4, 6>
5. Edge (1, 6): Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 4 - <1, 2, 4>
6. Edge (1, 8): No triangles as both nodes already have 2 connections
7. Edge (2, 6): No triangles as both nodes already have 3 connections
8. Edge (3, 6): No triangles as both nodes already have 2 connections
9. Edge (3, 9): Forms a triangle with node 6 - <3, 9, 6>
10. Edge (4, 5): Forms a triangle with node 9 - <4, 5, 9>
11. Edge (4, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 6 - <4, 5, 6>
12. Edge (5, 9): Forms a triangle with node 4 - <5, 9, 4>
13. Edge (6, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 4 - <6, 9, 3>
14. Edge (7, 9): No triangles as both nodes already have 2 connections
15. Edge (8, 9): No triangles as both nodes already have 2 connections

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 4>, <3, 9, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <6, 9, 3>.
