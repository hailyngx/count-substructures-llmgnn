Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Vertices: 7(1 connection) - 3(2 connections) - 5(3 connections) - 0(4 connections) - 2(4 connections) - 9(4 connections) - 1(5 connections) - 4(5 connections) - 8(5 connections) - 6(6 connections)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will now count the triangles:
For each edge, we will only consider the case where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

1. Edge (0, 6): Both 0 and 6 have 4 connections.
2. Edge (0, 8): 0 has 4 connections and 8 has 5 connections. They share a connection with vertex 6. Triangle <0, 6, 8>.
3. Edge (1, 5): Both 1 and 5 have 5 connections.
4. Edge (1, 6): Both 1 and 6 have 6 connections.
5. Edge (1, 9): 1 has 5 connections and 9 has 4 connections. They share a connection with vertex 4. Triangle <1, 4, 9>.
6. Edge (2, 4): Both 2 and 4 have 4 connections.
7. Edge (2, 9): Both 2 and 9 have 4 connections.
8. Edge (3, 8): 3 has 2 connections and 8 has 5 connections. They do not form a triangle.
9. Edge (4, 2): Refer to edge (2, 4).
10. Edge (4, 7): Both 4 and 7 have 1 connection.
11. Edge (4, 9): Refer to edge (2, 9).
12. Edge (5, 1): Refer to edge (1, 5).
13. Edge (6, 0): Refer to edge (0, 6).
14. Edge (6, 1): Refer to edge (1, 6).
15. Edge (6, 8): Refer to edge (0, 8).
16. Edge (7, 4): Refer to edge (4, 7).
17. Edge (8, 0): Refer to edge (0, 8).
18. Edge (8, 3): Refer to edge (3, 8).
19. Edge (8, 6): Refer to edge (6, 8).
20. Edge (9, 1): Refer to edge (1, 9).
21. Edge (9, 2): Refer to edge (2, 9).
22. Edge (9, 4): Refer to edge (4, 9).

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
