Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 0 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their connections:

Vertex 1: 0 connections
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections

Next, we go through each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 5) - Proceed since 0 has fewer connections.
   - Check for shared connections between 0 and 5: 0 shares a connection with 9.
   - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>.

2. Edge (0, 9) - Proceed since 0 has fewer connections.
   - Check for shared connections between 0 and 9: 0 shares a connection with 5.
   - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>.

3. Edge (2, 7) - Proceed since 2 has fewer connections.
   - No shared connection, no triangle formed.

4. Edge (3, 8) - Proceed since 3 has fewer connections.
   - No shared connection, no triangle formed.

5. Edge (3, 9) - Proceed since 3 has fewer connections.
   - Check for shared connections between 3 and 9: 3 shares connections with 0 and 8.
   - Triangles formed: <0, 3, 9> and <3, 8, 9>.

6. Edge (4, 8) - Proceed since 4 has fewer connections.
   - No shared connection, no triangle formed.

7. Edge (5, 0) - Skipped since 0 is lower labeled.
8. Edge (6, 8) - Skipped since 6 is lower labeled.
9. Edge (7, 2) - Skipped since 2 is lower labeled.
10. Edge (7, 9) - Proceed since 7 has fewer connections.
    - Check for shared connections between 7 and 9: 7 shares connections with 2 and 0.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>.

11. Edge (8, 3) - Proceed since 3 has fewer connections.
    - Check for shared connections between 8 and 3: 8 shares a connection with 9.
    - Triangle formed: <3, 8, 9>.

12. Edge (8, 4) - Proceed since 4 has fewer connections.
    - No shared connection, no triangle formed.

13. Edge (8, 6) - Proceed since 6 has fewer connections.
    - No shared connection, no triangle formed.

14. Edge (9, 0) - Skipped since 0 is lower labeled.
15. Edge (9, 3) - Skipped since 3 is lower labeled.
16. Edge (9, 7) - Proceed since 7 has fewer connections.
    - Check for shared connections between 9 and 7: 9 shares connections with 0 and 3.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>.
