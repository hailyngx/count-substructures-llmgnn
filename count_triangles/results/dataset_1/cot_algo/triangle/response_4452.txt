Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, we get the following relabeling: 

Node 1 has 0 connections.
Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 1 connection.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 1 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.

Now, examining the edges following the degree-based ordering:

1. Edge (1, 2): Does not form a triangle as Node 1 and Node 2 have no common neighbors.
2. Edge (0, 5): Does not form a triangle as Node 0 and Node 5 have no common neighbors.
3. Edge (9, 4): Does not form a triangle as Node 9 and Node 4 have no common neighbors.
4. Edge (6, 4): Does not form a triangle as Node 6 and Node 4 have no common neighbors.
5. Edge (1, 2): Does not form a triangle as Node 1 and Node 2 have no common neighbors.
6. Edge (2, 7): Forms a triangle <2, 3, 7>.
7. Edge (2, 8): Forms a triangle <2, 4, 8>.
8. Edge (3, 4): Forms a triangle <3, 5, 4>.
9. Edge (3, 5): Does not form a triangle as Node 3 and Node 5 have no common neighbors.
10. Edge (3, 7): Forms a triangle <3, 5, 7>.
11. Edge (4, 5): Forms a triangle <4, 3, 5>.
12. Edge (4, 9): Does not form a triangle as Node 4 and Node 9 have no common neighbors.
13. Edge (7, 2): Forms a triangle <7, 3, 2>.
14. Edge (7, 8): Forms a triangle <7, 2, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5], and the unique triangles found are <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 5, 7>, <7, 3, 2>.
