Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 6: 0 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 7: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 2, 9>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 8, 9>
- <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
