Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Vertex 2 (Degree 1) - Lowest degree
Vertex 3 (Degree 3)
Vertex 6 (Degree 3)
Vertex 9 (Degree 4)
Vertex 5 (Degree 5)
Vertex 8 (Degree 5)
Vertex 4 (Degree 6)
Vertex 7 (Degree 6)
Vertex 1 (Degree 7) - Highest degree
Vertex 0 (Degree 8)

Now, we will count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 1) - Vertex 1 has degree 7 which is less than the degree of Vertex 0 (8). Checking shared connections, we find a triangle with Vertex 1, 0, and 4. This forms the triangle <0, 1, 4>.

2. Edge (0, 2) - Proceeding with this edge is not possible as Vertex 0 (degree 8) has a higher degree than Vertex 2 (degree 1).

3. Edge (0, 3) - Proceeding with this edge is not possible as Vertex 0 (degree 8) has a higher degree than Vertex 3 (degree 3).

4. Edge (0, 4) - Vertex 4 has degree 6 which is less than the degree of Vertex 0 (8). Checking shared connections, we find a triangle with Vertex 0, 4, and 6. This forms the triangle <0, 4, 6>.

5. Edge (0, 5) - Vertex 5 has degree 5 which is less than the degree of Vertex 0 (8). Checking shared connections, we find a triangle with Vertex 0, 5, and 9. This forms the triangle <0, 5, 9>.

6. Edge (0, 6) - Proceeding with this edge is not possible as Vertex 0 (degree 8) has a higher degree than Vertex 6 (degree 3).

7. Edge (0, 7) - Proceeding with this edge is not possible as Vertex 0 (degree 8) has a higher degree than Vertex 7 (degree 6).

8. Edge (0, 8) - Proceeding with this edge is not possible as Vertex 0 (degree 8) has a higher degree than Vertex 8 (degree 5).

This yields a total of 3 triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, and <0, 5, 9>. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
