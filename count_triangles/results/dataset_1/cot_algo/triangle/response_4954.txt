Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 3, 1, 9, 7.

Now, checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 1): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1.  
- Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3. 
- Edge (1, 6): Forms a triangle with shared connection 6. 
- Edge (1, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 7.
- Edge (1, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1.
- Edge (2, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 7. 
- Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 6): Forms a triangle with shared connection 6. 
- Edge (5, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 9.
- Edge (6, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 7. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 1>.
