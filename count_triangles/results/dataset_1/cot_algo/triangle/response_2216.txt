Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows: 
- Node 6 has 0 connections. 
- Nodes 2, 3, 7, and 10 have 1 connection each. 
- Nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8 have 2 connections each. 
- Node 9 has 3 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge between Node 1 and Node 2:
   - Shared connection: Node 4
2. Edge between Node 1 and Node 4:
   - Shared connection: Node 5
3. Edge between Node 1 and Node 5: 
   - Shared connection: None
4. Edge between Node 1 and Node 8:
   - Shared connection: None
5. Edge between Node 2 and Node 3:
   - Shared connection: None
6. Edge between Node 2 and Node 7:
   - Shared connection: None
7. Edge between Node 4 and Node 7:
   - Shared connection: None
8. Edge between Node 5 and Node 9:
   - Shared connection: Node 8
9. Edge between Node 8 and Node 9:
   - Shared connection: None
