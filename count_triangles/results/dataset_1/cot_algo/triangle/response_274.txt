Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree, which is the number of connections each vertex has.

The degrees of the vertices in this graph are as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 5
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 3
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 1

Based on the degree-based ordering, we relabel the vertices as follows:
- Vertex 3 (degree 1) becomes vertex 0
- Vertex 9 (degree 1) becomes vertex 1
- Vertex 2 (degree 2) becomes vertex 2
- Vertex 0 (degree 3) becomes vertex 3
- Vertex 5 (degree 3) becomes vertex 4
- Vertex 6 (degree 3) becomes vertex 5
- Vertex 7 (degree 3) becomes vertex 6
- Vertex 8 (degree 3) becomes vertex 7
- Vertex 1 (degree 5) becomes vertex 8
- Vertex 4 (degree 4) becomes vertex 9

Now, let's count the triangles by following the process described earlier.

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
