Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in the graph.

First, we list the nodes with their degrees:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 1
Node 9: degree 3

Now, we reorder the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 8 (degree 1)
Node 7 (degree 2)
Node 0 (degree 3)
Node 1 (degree 3)
Node 2 (degree 3)
Node 9 (degree 3)
Node 3 (degree 4)
Node 4 (degree 4)
Node 5 (degree 4)
Node 6 (degree 4)

Next, we analyze the edges:
Edge (0, 4): Both nodes 0 and 4 have degree 3, proceed.
Node 0 shares connections with nodes 5 and 9. This forms a triangle <0, 5, 9>.

Edge (0, 5): Node 0 has degree 3, while node 5 has degree 4, proceed.
Node 0 shares connections with nodes 4 and 9. This forms a triangle <0, 4, 9>.

Edge (0, 9): Both nodes 0 and 9 have degree 3, proceed.
Node 0 shares connections with nodes 4 and 5. This forms a triangle <0, 4, 5>.

Edges (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 9) do not form triangles.

Edge (2, 5): Node 2 has degree 3, while node 5 has degree 4, proceed.
Node 2 shares connections with nodes 0 and 9. This forms a triangle <0, 2, 9>.

Edges (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 2) do not form triangles.

In total, the count of triangles inside brackets [] is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 2, 9>, and <0, 4, 5>.
