Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following sequence: 7, 10, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we start with the edge involving vertex 7 (node 7):

- Vertex 7 connects with: 4, 6
  - No triangles found

Moving on to the edge involving vertex 10 (node 10):

- Vertex 10 connects with: 9
  - No triangles found

Next, we consider the edge involving vertex 3:

- Vertex 3 connects with: 1, 5
  - Found triangle <1, 3, 5>

Then, we move to the edge involving vertex 5:

- Vertex 5 connects with: 3, 4
  - Found triangle <3, 4, 5>

After that, we check the edge involving vertex 2:

- Vertex 2 connects with: 1, 9
  - Found triangle <1, 2, 9>

Moving on to the edge involving vertex 1:

- Vertex 1 connects with: 2, 3, 4, 6
  - Found triangles <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 6>

Checking the edge involving vertex 4:

- Vertex 4 connects with: 1, 5, 6, 8
  - Found triangles <1, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 8>

Lastly, we consider the edge involving vertex 6:

- Vertex 6 connects with: 1, 4, 8
  - Found triangle <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
