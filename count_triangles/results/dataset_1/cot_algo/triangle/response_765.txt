Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices with their corresponding degrees:
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections

Next, we sort the vertices by their degrees:
Vertices in order: 1, 3, 7, 0, 6, 8, 4, 9, 2, 5

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
(0, 7): No triangles
(0, 9): No triangles
(1, 8): No triangles
(2, 4): No triangles
(2, 6): No triangles
(3, 5): No triangles
(4, 2): Triangle: <2, 4, 5>
(4, 5): No triangles
(5, 3): No triangles
(5, 4): No triangles
(5, 9): Triangles: <2, 5, 9> and <4, 5, 9>
(6, 2): No triangles
(6, 7): No triangles
(7, 0): No triangles
(7, 6): No triangles
(8, 1): No triangles
(8, 9): No triangles
(9, 0): No triangles
(9, 5): Triangles: <2, 5, 9> and <4, 5, 9>
(9, 8): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] and the unique triangles found are <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, and <4, 5, 9>.
