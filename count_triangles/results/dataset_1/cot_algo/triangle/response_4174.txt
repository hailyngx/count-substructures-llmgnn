Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degree, the new labels for the nodes will be:  
Node 0 (degree 3)  
Node 1 (degree 2)  
Node 3 (degree 2)  
Node 4 (degree 4)  
Node 6 (degree 3)  
Node 7 (degree 3)  
Node 2 (degree 4)  
Node 5 (degree 5)  
Node 8 (degree 5)  
Node 9 (degree 5)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 have a shared connection with Node 5, forming a triangle <0, 4, 5>.
- Edge (0, 5): Node 0 and Node 5 have a shared connection with Node 3, forming a triangle <0, 5, 3>.
- Edge (0, 9): Node 0 and Node 9 have a shared connection with Node 6, forming a triangle <0, 9, 6>.
- Edge (1, 6): Node 1 and Node 6 have a shared connection with Node 8, forming a triangle <1, 6, 8>.
- Edge (1, 8): Node 1 and Node 8 have a shared connection with Node 2, forming a triangle <1, 8, 2>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
