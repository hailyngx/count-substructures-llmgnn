Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
Node 3 (deg 2) <br>
Node 7 (deg 1) <br>
Node 9 (deg 1) <br>
Node 2 (deg 2) <br>
Node 6 (deg 2) <br>
Node 4 (deg 3) <br>
Node 5 (deg 4) <br>
Node 1 (deg 4) <br>
Node 0 (deg 5) <br>
Node 8 (deg 5) <br>

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles formed in the graph. 

Total number of triangles: [15]
