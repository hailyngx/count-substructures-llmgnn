Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 

Vertex 5 (0 connections) 

Vertices 4, 5, 7 (1 connection each) 

Vertices 1, 3, 6 (2 connections each) 

Vertices 2, 9 (3 connections each) 

Vertex 8 (6 connections) 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles: 

Total number of triangles: [2] 

Unique triangles: <0, 8, 9>, <2, 7, 9>
