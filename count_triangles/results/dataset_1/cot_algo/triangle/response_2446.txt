Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Degrees: 2, 0, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 1, 3

Sorted vertices by degree: 1, 8, 0, 2, 6, 4, 9, 3, 5, 7

Now, we will relabel the vertices as follows:
1 -> 0
8 -> 1
0 -> 2
2 -> 3
6 -> 4
4 -> 5
9 -> 6
3 -> 7
5 -> 8
7 -> 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [2]
