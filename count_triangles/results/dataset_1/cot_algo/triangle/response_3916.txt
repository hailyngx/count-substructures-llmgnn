Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After reordering the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Vertex 0 has degree 4,
Vertex 1 has degree 2,
Vertex 2 has degree 1,
Vertex 3 has degree 3,
Vertex 4 has degree 2,
Vertex 5 has degree 2,
Vertex 6 has degree 2,
Vertex 7 has degree 3,
Vertex 8 has degree 2,
Vertex 9 has degree 4.

Using the degree-based ordering method to count triangles:

Considering edge (0, 2): No triangle.
Considering edge (0, 4): 1 triangle <0, 4, 9>.
Considering edge (0, 6): 1 triangle <0, 6, 5>.
Considering edge (0, 7): 1 triangle <0, 7, 9>.
Considering edge (1, 3): No triangle.
Considering edge (1, 9): 1 triangle <1, 9, 4>.
Considering edge (2, 0): No triangle.
Considering edge (3, 1): No triangle.
Considering edge (3, 5): No triangle.
Considering edge (3, 8): No triangle.
Considering edge (4, 0): 1 triangle <4, 0, 6>.
Considering edge (4, 9): 1 triangle <4, 9, 7>.
Considering edge (5, 3): No triangle.
Considering edge (5, 6): 1 triangle <5, 6, 0>.
Considering edge (6, 0): No triangle.
Considering edge (6, 5): 1 triangle <6, 5, 0>.
Considering edge (7, 0): 1 triangle <7, 0, 4>.
Considering edge (7, 8): No triangle.
Considering edge (7, 9): 1 triangle <7, 9, 4>.
Considering edge (8, 3): No triangle.
Considering edge (8, 7): No triangle.
Considering edge (9, 1): 1 triangle <9, 1, 3>.
Considering edge (9, 4): 1 triangle <9, 4, 0>.
Considering edge (9, 7): 1 triangle <9, 7, 0>.

Total number of triangles: [10]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 9, 4>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 9, 7>, <5, 6, 0>, <6, 5, 0>, <7, 0, 4>, <9, 1, 3>.
