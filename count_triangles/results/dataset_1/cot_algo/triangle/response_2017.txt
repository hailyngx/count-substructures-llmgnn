Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following new labels for the vertices:

0 ⟶ 1 connection
1 ⟶ 1 connection
2 ⟶ 2 connections
4 ⟶ 2 connections
7 ⟶ 1 connection
8 ⟶ 2 connections
5 ⟶ 3 connections
6 ⟶ 5 connections
9 ⟶ 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles: 

Triangles:
1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <4, 5, 9>
3. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
