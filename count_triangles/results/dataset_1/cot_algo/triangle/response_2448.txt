Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by the number of connections they have in ascending order:

Nodes: 8, 3, 5, 6, 9, 1, 0, 4, 7, 2

Now, we relabel the vertices accordingly:

Node 8 -> Node 0
Node 3 -> Node 1
Node 5 -> Node 2
Node 6 -> Node 3
Node 9 -> Node 4
Node 1 -> Node 5
Node 0 -> Node 6
Node 4 -> Node 7
Node 7 -> Node 8
Node 2 -> Node 9

Next, we go through each edge in the graph and count the number of triangles formed:

Triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
