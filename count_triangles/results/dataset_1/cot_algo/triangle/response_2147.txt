Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for this graph is as follows:
Node 8 has 0 connections
Nodes 1 and 5 have 1 connection each
Nodes 2 and 4 have 2 connections each
Nodes 3 and 9 have 4 connections each
Nodes 0 and 6 have 5 connections each
Node 7 has 6 connections

Following the method of checking edges between nodes with lower labels and fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 2) is valid, forms triangle with node 7: <0, 2, 7>
- Edge (0, 3) is valid, forms triangle with node 1 and node 7: <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (0, 6) is valid, forms triangle with node 1 and node 7: <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (0, 7) is valid, forms triangle with node 2 and node 3: <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 3>
- Edge (0, 9) is valid, forms triangle with node 3: <0, 9, 3>
- Edge (1, 2) is valid, forms triangle with node 4: <1, 2, 4>
- Edge (1, 3) is valid, forms triangle with node 7: <1, 3, 7>
- Edge (1, 4) is valid, no triangle formed
- Edge (2, 1) is ignored
- Edge (2, 3) is ignored
- Edge (3, 1) is valid, no triangle formed
- Edge (3, 6) is valid, no triangle formed
- Edge (3, 7) is valid, no triangle formed
- Edge (4, 1) is valid, forms triangle with node 6: <4, 1, 6>
- Edge (4, 6) is valid, forms triangle with node 7: <4, 6, 7>
- Edge (4, 7) is valid, no triangle formed
- Edge (4, 9) is valid, no triangle formed
- Edge (5, 7) is valid, no triangle formed
- Edge (5, 9) is ignored
- Edge (6, 3) is valid, no triangle formed
- Edge (6, 4) is valid, forms triangle with node 0: <6, 4, 0>
- Edge (6, 7) is valid, no triangle formed
- Edge (6, 9) is valid, forms triangle with node 0: <6, 9, 0>
- Edge (7, 3) is valid, no triangle formed
- Edge (7, 4) is valid, forms triangle with node 0: <7, 4, 0>
- Edge (7, 5) is ignored
- Edge (9, 4) is ignored
- Edge (9, 5) is ignored
- Edge (9, 6) is ignored

The total number of triangles in the graph is 9, and they are:
<0, 2, 7> <0, 3, 1> <0, 3, 7> <0, 6, 1> <0, 6, 7> <0, 7, 2> <0, 7, 3> <0, 9, 3> <1, 2, 4>
