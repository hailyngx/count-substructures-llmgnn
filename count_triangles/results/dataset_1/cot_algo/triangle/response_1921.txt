Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following labels based on the number of connections: 3, 7, 5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 0, 8, 9.

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 4, and 6. <0, 1, 4>
2. Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 1, and 9. <0, 1, 6>
3. Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle since node 7 has a higher label.
4. Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 1, and 6. <0, 1, 9>
5. Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle since node 4 has a higher label.
6. Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 0, and 9. <1, 6, 9>
7. Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 0, and 6. <1, 6, 9>
8. Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle since node 4 has a higher label.
9. Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle since node 8 has a higher label.
10. Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 3, 0, and 1. <0, 1, 3>
11. Edge (4, 3) does not form a triangle since node 3 has a higher label.
12. Edge (6, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 6, 1, and 9. <0, 1, 6>
13. Edge (6, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 6, 0, and 9. <0, 1, 6>
14. Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle since node 7 has a higher label.
15. Edge (6, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 6, 0, and 1. <0, 1, 6>
16. Edge (7, 0) does not form a triangle since node 0 has a higher label.
17. Edge (7, 6) does not form a triangle since node 6 has a higher label.
18. Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle since node 3 has a higher label.
19. Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 8, 3, and 9. <3, 8, 9>
20. Edge (9, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 9, 0, and 1. <0, 1, 9>
21. Edge (9, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 9, 0, and 6. <0, 1, 9>
22. Edge (9, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 9, 0, and 1.  <0, 1, 9>
23. Edge (9, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 9, 0, and 1. <0, 1, 9>
24. Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle since node 7 has a higher label.
25. Edge (9, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 9, 3, and 0. <0, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
