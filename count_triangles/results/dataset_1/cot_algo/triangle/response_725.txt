Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections, the labels will be as follows: 

Node 5: 0 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Based on the given edges and node labels, we can find the triangles and count them:

Triangles: 
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
