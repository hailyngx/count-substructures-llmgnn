Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph by sorting vertices based on their number of connections. 

The sorted list of vertices based on degree is as follows: 

Vertex 2 (Degree 3) 
Vertex 8 (Degree 1) 
Vertex 9 (Degree 2) 
Vertex 4 (Degree 4) 
Vertex 7 (Degree 4) 
Vertex 3 (Degree 4) 
Vertex 6 (Degree 4) 
Vertex 1 (Degree 4) 
Vertex 0 (Degree 5) 

Going through the edges while considering only cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, the triangles formed are as follows: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<6, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
