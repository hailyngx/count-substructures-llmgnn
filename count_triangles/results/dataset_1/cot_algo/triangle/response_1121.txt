Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method. 
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices in ascending order of connections:
0: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
8: 1 connection
9: 1 connection
1: 4 connections
7: 5 connections
6: 5 connections
3: 6 connections

Now, we will perform the triangle counting by considering each edge. Since the vertex with the lower label should have fewer connections, we will ignore the edge (6, 0) as it violates this rule.

Counting triangles:
1. Edge (1, 3): Check shared connections -> (1, 3, 2)
2. Edge (1, 6): Check shared connections -> (1, 3, 6)
3. Edge (1, 7): Check shared connections -> (1, 3, 7)
4. Edge (2, 3): No triangles with this edge.
5. Edge (3, 5): No triangles with this edge.
6. Edge (3, 6): Check shared connections -> (1, 3, 6)
7. Edge (3, 7): Check shared connections -> (1, 3, 7)
8. Edge (7, 8): No triangles with this edge.
9. Edge (7, 9): No triangles with this edge.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 6>, and <1, 3, 7>.
