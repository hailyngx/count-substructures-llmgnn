Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices:  
0 - degree 2  
1 - degree 4  
4 - degree 2  
8 - degree 1  
9 - degree 1  
7 - degree 4  
2 - degree 3  
5 - degree 3  
6 - degree 4  
3 - degree 6  

Now relabel the vertices accordingly:  
0 - 0  
8 - 1  
9 - 2  
4 - 3  
7 - 4  
2 - 5  
5 - 6  
6 - 7  
1 - 8  
3 - 9  

Now, we follow each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3):  
    - Shared connections: 6  
    - Triangle: <0, 3, 6>

2. Edge (0, 6):  
    - Shared connections: None

3. Edge (1, 2):  
    - Shared connections: None

4. Edge (1, 5):  
    - Shared connections: None

5. Edge (1, 6):  
    - Shared connections: None

6. Edge (1, 8):  
    - Shared connections: None

7. Edge (2, 3):  
    - Shared connections: 5  
    - Triangle: <2, 3, 5>

8. Edge (2, 7):  
    - Shared connections: None

9. Edge (3, 4):  
    - Shared connections: None

10. Edge (3, 5):  
    - Shared connections: 1  
    - Triangle: <3, 5, 7>

11. Edge (3, 6):  
    - Shared connections: 0  
    - Triangle: <0, 3, 6>

12. Edge (4, 7):  
    - Shared connections: None

13. Edge (5, 7):  
    - Shared connections: 3  
    - Triangle: <3, 5, 7>

14. Edge (6, 7):  
    - Shared connections: 4  
    - Triangle: <3, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [4]
