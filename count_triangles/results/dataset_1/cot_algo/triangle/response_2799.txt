Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Node 0 - degree 3
Node 1 - degree 4
Node 4 - degree 1
Node 5 - degree 1
Node 6 - degree 2
Node 7 - degree 3
Node 8 - degree 2
Node 9 - degree 4
Node 2 - degree 4
Node 3 - degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will iterate through the edges and count the number of triangles. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Count of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<4, 9, 5>
