Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The vertices are listed with their corresponding connections:

0: 2 connections
1: 5 connections
2: 5 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 5 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 5 connections
9: 2 connections

Sorted vertices by degree: [0, 9, 6, 3, 4, 7, 1, 2, 5, 8]

Now, we will process the edges following the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: 
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
