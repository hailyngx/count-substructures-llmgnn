Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Starting with the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 1
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 4

Now, relabel the nodes according to their degrees from least to most:
Node 3 (degree 1) -> becomes Node 0
Node 2 (degree 2) -> becomes Node 1
Node 5 (degree 2) -> becomes Node 2
Node 6 (degree 2) -> becomes Node 3
Node 7 (degree 2) -> becomes Node 4
Node 4 (degree 3) -> becomes Node 5
Node 0 (degree 4) -> becomes Node 6
Node 8 (degree 4) -> becomes Node 7
Node 9 (degree 4) -> becomes Node 8
Node 1 (degree 5) -> becomes Node 9

Now, we will check the edges following the rule to only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
