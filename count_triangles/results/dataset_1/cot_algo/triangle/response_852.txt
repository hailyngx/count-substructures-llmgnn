Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes will be:
Node 6 (degree 1)
Node 3 (degree 0)
Node 7 (degree 2)
Node 5 (degree 2)
Node 8 (degree 2)
Node 0 (degree 3)
Node 2 (degree 3)
Node 1 (degree 4)
Node 9 (degree 4)
Node 4 (degree 5)

Now, we will go through each edge, consider the edge only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, and count the number of triangles formed by shared connections:

- Edge (0, 4):
    - Shared connections: 5
- Edge (0, 5):
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (0, 7):
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 2):
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 4):
    - Shared connections: 0
- Edge (1, 8):
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 9):
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 1):
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 4):
    - Shared connections: 0
- Edge (2, 5):
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (4, 7):
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (4, 9):
    - Shared connections: 1
- Edge (5, 8):
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (7, 0):
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (7, 4):
    - Shared connections: 0
- Edge (8, 1):
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (8, 5):
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (9, 1):
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (9, 4):
    - Shared connections: 1
- Edge (9, 6):
    - Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <4, 9, 6>, <4, 1, 9>
