Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new vertex order is: 

Vertices: (0, 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9)

The triangles found in the graph are: 
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
