Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 1(2), 3(2), 4(2), 8(3), 1(3), 5(3), 6(4), 0(4), 3(4), 7(5)

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
1(0), 3(1), 4(2), 8(3), 1(4), 5(5), 6(6), 0(7), 3(8), 7(9)

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 5): Check for shared connections {2, 7}, form triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (0, 7): Check for shared connections {2, 5}, form triangle <0, 2, 7>
- Edge (0, 8): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (0, 9): Check for shared connections {3, 2}, form triangle <0, 3, 9>
- Edge (1, 3): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (1, 6): Check for shared connections {2}, no triangle formed
- Edge (2, 4): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (2, 5): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (2, 6): Check for shared connections {1}, no triangle formed
- Edge (2, 7): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (2, 8): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (2, 9): Check for shared connections {7}, no triangle formed
- Edge (3, 1): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (3, 9): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (4, 2): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (4, 6): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (5, 0): Check for shared connections {2, 7}, form triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (5, 2): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (5, 7): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (6, 1): Check for shared connections {2}, no triangle formed
- Edge (6, 2): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (6, 4): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (6, 7): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (7, 0): Check for shared connections {2, 5}, form triangle <0, 2, 7>
- Edge (7, 2): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (7, 5): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (7, 6): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (7, 9): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (8, 0): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (8, 2): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (8, 9): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (9, 0): Check for shared connections {3, 2}, form triangle <0, 3, 9>
- Edge (9, 2): Check for shared connections {7}, form triangle <0, 2, 9>
- Edge (9, 3): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (9, 7): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed
- Edge (9, 8): Check for shared connections {}, no triangle formed

Count of triangles: [2]
Triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>
