Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following numbering: 

Node 2: Degree 0
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting the triangles: 

1. Edge (0, 3): Nodes 0 and 3 have a shared connection with Node 6 forming a triangle <0, 3, 6>.
2. Edge (0, 6): No additional triangles formed.
3. Edge (1, 5): No additional triangles formed.
4. Edge (3, 4): Nodes 3 and 4 have a shared connection with Node 8 forming a triangle <3, 4, 8>.
5. Edge (4, 8): No additional triangles formed.
6. Edge (5, 7): Node 5 and 7 have a shared connection with Nodes 8 and 9 forming triangles <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>.
7. Edge (5, 9): Node 5 and 9 have a shared connection with Nodes 7 and 8 forming triangles <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>.
8. Edge (7, 8): Nodes 7 and 8 have a shared connection with Node 9 forming a triangle <7, 8, 9>.
9. Edge (7, 9): No additional triangles formed.
10. Edge (8, 9): No additional triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, and <7, 8, 9>.
