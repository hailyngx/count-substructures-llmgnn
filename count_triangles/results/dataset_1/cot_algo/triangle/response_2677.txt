Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 1

The vertices sorted by their degree are: 9, 1, 7, 3, 2, 5, 6, 0, 4, 8.

Analyzing the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 1): Shared connections with 0 are 3 and 4, forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- Edge (0, 3): Shared connection with 0 is 4, forming a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
- Edge (0, 4): No new triangles.
- Edge (0, 8): Shared connections with 0 are 2, 3, 5, and 6, forming triangles <0, 8, 2>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 5>, and <0, 8, 6>.
- Edge (1, 7): No new triangles.
- Edge (2, 5): No new triangles.
- Edge (2, 6): No new triangles.
- Edge (3, 4): No new triangles.
- Edge (3, 8): Shared connections with 3 are 0, 4, and 8, forming triangles <3, 8, 0> and <3, 8, 4>.
- Edge (4, 6): Shared connection with 4 is 0, forming a triangle <4, 6, 0>.
- Edge (4, 7): No new triangles.
- Edge (5, 8): No new triangles.
- Edge (6, 8): No new triangles.

Counting the total number of triangles inside brackets []: [8].
