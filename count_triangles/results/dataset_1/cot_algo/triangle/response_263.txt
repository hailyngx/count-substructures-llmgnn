Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Node 6 -> Degree 2
Node 7 -> Degree 2
Node 9 -> Degree 2
Node 3 -> Degree 3
Node 1 -> Degree 3
Node 2 -> Degree 3
Node 5 -> Degree 3
Node 4 -> Degree 4
Node 8 -> Degree 4
Node 0 -> Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 7, 9>
