Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 3 has 0 connections
Node 0 has 4 connections
Node 1 has 3 connections
Node 6 has 2 connections
Node 8 has 2 connections
Node 3 has 2 connections
Node 4 has 4 connections
Node 7 has 4 connections
Node 5 has 5 connections
Node 9 has 3 connections

Based on the ordering above, we can simplify the graph as follows:
(3) (0) (1) (6) (8) (3) (4) (7) (5) (9)
Edges: (6, 7) (8, 7) (3, 0) (3, 0) (1, 0) (6, 9) (6, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (6, 7) (8, 5) (8, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (6, 7) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (5, 9) (5, 7)

Calculating the triangles:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
