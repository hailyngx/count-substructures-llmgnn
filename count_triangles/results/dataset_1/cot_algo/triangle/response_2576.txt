Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we will calculate the degree of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0 has degree 5
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 is not present in the edges, so it has degree 0
- Node 9 has degree 2

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 8 (degree 0)
- Node 5 (degree 1)
- Nodes 2, 7, 9 (degree 2)
- Nodes 3, 4 (degree 3)
- Nodes 1, 6 (degree 4)
- Node 0 (degree 5)

Next, we will count the triangles by iterating through the edges and following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

There are 6 triangles in the graph:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
