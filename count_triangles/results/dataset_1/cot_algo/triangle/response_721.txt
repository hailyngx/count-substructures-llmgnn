Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:

Node 2: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 4: 7 connections

We will now proceed through the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections.

Checking (0, 1): Both nodes have 4 connections. No triangle.
Checking (0, 4): Node 0 has 5 connections, Node 4 has 7 connections. Proceed.
