Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
Degree: (2, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2)

Relabeling the vertices accordingly:
(3, 1, 7, 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 4, 9)

Now, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Edges to consider: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (9, 8)

Now, we check for shared connections between the vertices of each edge:

- For edge (0, 4): Vertices 0 and 4 have a shared connection with vertex 2, forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- For edge (0, 6): No triangle formed.
- For edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
- For edge (4, 2): Vertices 4 and 2 have a shared connection with vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- For edge (4, 8): Vertices 4 and 8 have a shared connection with vertex 5, forming triangle <4, 5, 8>.
- For edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.
- For edge (5, 9): No triangle formed.
- For edge (6, 7): No triangle formed.
- For edge (9, 8): Vertices 9 and 8 have a shared connection with vertex 5, forming triangle <5, 8, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 9>
