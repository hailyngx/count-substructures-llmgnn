Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes: 7, 0, 2, 4, 3, 5, 9, 8, 6, 1

Now we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (1, 3): Node 1 has connections with nodes 4, 6, and 9. Node 3 has connections with nodes 1 and 8. Node 1 is lower labeled and has fewer connections. They share node 1, forming a triangle <1, 3, 8>.

2. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 has connections with nodes 3, 6, and 9. Node 4 doesn't have any additional connections. Node 4 is lower labeled and has fewer connections. They share node 1, forming a triangle <1, 4, 6>.

3. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 has connections with nodes 3, 4, and 9. Node 6 has connections with nodes 2 and 5. Node 6 is lower labeled and has fewer connections. They share node 1, forming a triangle <1, 6, 2>.

4. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 has connections with nodes 3, 4, and 6. Node 9 has connections with nodes 8. Node 9 is lower labeled and has fewer connections. They share node 1, forming a triangle <1, 9, 8>.

5. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 doesn't have any additional connections. Node 6 has connections with nodes 1, 5, and 2. Node 2 is lower labeled and has fewer connections. They don't form a triangle.

6. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 has connections with nodes 1 and 8. Node 8 has connections with nodes 5 and 9. Node 3 is lower labeled and has fewer connections. They share node 3, forming a triangle <3, 8, 5>.

7. Edge (4, 1): This edge was counted earlier with edge (1, 4).

8. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 doesn't have any additional connections. Node 6 has connections with nodes 1, 2, and 5. Node 5 is lower labeled and has fewer connections. They don't form a triangle.

9. Edge (5, 8): Node 5 has connections with nodes 6. Node 8 has connections with nodes 3 and 9. Node 5 is lower labeled and has fewer connections. They don't form a triangle.

10. Edge (6, 1): This edge was counted earlier with edge (1, 6).

11. Edge (6, 2): This edge was counted earlier with edge (2, 6).

12. Edge (6, 5): This edge was counted earlier with edge (5, 6).

13. Edge (8, 3): This edge was counted earlier with edge (3, 8).

14. Edge (8, 5): This edge was counted earlier with edge (5, 8).

15. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 has connections with nodes 3, 5, and 9. Node 9 has connections with nodes 1 and 8. Node 8 is lower labeled and has fewer connections. They share node 8, forming a triangle <8, 9, 1>.

16. Edge (9, 1): This edge was counted earlier with edge (1, 9).

17. Edge (9, 8): This edge was counted earlier with edge (8, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 2>, and <1, 9, 8>.
