Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By reordering the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree:
0 (degree 2)
3 (degree 2)
5 (degree 2)
8 (degree 2)
1 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)
4 (degree 3)
7 (degree 4)
2 (degree 4)
9 (degree 5)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine each edge based on the vertices' order:

For edge (0, 2): Both vertices have degree 2, so we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 9, forming a triangle <0, 2, 9>.
For edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has degree 2, while vertex 9 has degree 5, so we skip this edge.
For edge (1, 6): Both vertices have degree 3, so we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 9, forming a triangle <1, 6, 9>.
For edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has degree 3, while vertex 7 has degree 4, so we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 9, forming a triangle <1, 7, 9>.
For edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has degree 4, while vertex 9 has degree 5, so we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 0, forming a triangle <2, 9, 0>.
For edge (6, 9): Both vertices have degree 3, so we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 1, forming a triangle <6, 9, 1>.
For edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has degree 4, while vertex 9 has degree 5, so we proceed. They share connections with vertices 1, 6, forming triangles <7, 9, 1> and <7, 9, 6>.
(Other edges do not meet the condition for examination based on the Degree-Based Ordering method)

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 1>
