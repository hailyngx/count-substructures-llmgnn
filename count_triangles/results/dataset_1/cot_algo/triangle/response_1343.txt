Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the order becomes: 3, 9, 1, 6, 2, 7, 8, 5, 4, 0. 
Hence, the sorted list of edges becomes: (3, 1), (9, 7), (1, 3), (6, 0), (2, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (0, 2), (7, 5), (8, 4), (5, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (0, 4), (5, 7), (0, 6), (5, 8), (0, 7), (0, 8), (8, 5), (4, 8), (5, 2), (5, 8), (4, 0), (1, 4), (4, 5), (1, 5), (7, 9) 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
