Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 0: Degree 2  
Node 2: Degree 2  
Node 7: Degree 2  
Node 3: Degree 3  
Node 6: Degree 3  
Node 8: Degree 3  
Node 5: Degree 4  
Node 1: Degree 7  
Node 4: Degree 7  

Now, we will go through each edge considering the condition that we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  

Edges involving Node 0:  
- Edge (0, 1): Node 1 already has a higher label and more connections, so no triangle is formed.

Edges involving Node 2:  
- Edge (2, 1): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 1, and they share Node 5 in common.  
- Triangle <1, 2, 5> is formed.

Edges involving Node 7:  
- Edge (7, 2): Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 2, but they do not share any common neighbor. No triangle is formed.  
- Edge (7, 6): Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 6, and they share Node 4 in common.  
- Triangle <4, 6, 7> is formed.

Edges involving Node 3:  
- Edge (3, 1): Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 1, and they share Node 4 in common.  
- Triangle <1, 3, 4> is formed.

Edges involving Node 6:  
- Edge (6, 4): Node 6 has fewer connections than Node 4, but they already form a triangle <4, 6, 7> with Node 7.

Edges involving Node 8:  
- Edge (8, 1): Node 8 has fewer connections than Node 1, and they share Node 4 in common.  
- Triangle <1, 4, 8> is formed.

Edges involving Node 5:  
- Edge (5, 4): Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 4, but they already form a triangle <1, 2, 5> with Node 2.

Combining all the triangles found, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
