Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
0(2) 2(1) 9(2) 5(3) 3(4) 6(4) 7(4) 1(5) 4(5) 8(6)

Edges considered based on lower labeled vertex with fewer connections:
(0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 9)

Triangles found from shared connections:
< 1, 4, 8 > < 3, 4, 7 > < 5, 6, 7 >

Total number of triangles: [3]
