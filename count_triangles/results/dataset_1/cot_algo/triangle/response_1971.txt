Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to create a list of nodes sorted by their degree. The degrees of each node are as follows:  
Node 0: degree 2  
Node 1: degree 2  
Node 2: degree 1  
Node 3: degree 2  
Node 4: degree 6  
Node 5: degree 3  
Node 6: degree 1  
Node 7: degree 2  
Node 8: degree 5  
Node 9: degree 4  

Now we will relabel the nodes accordingly:  
Node 2: 0  
Node 6: 1  
Node 0: 2  
Node 1: 3  
Node 3: 4  
Node 7: 5  
Node 5: 6  
Node 9: 7  
Node 8: 8  
Node 4: 9  

Now we analyze each edge based on the relabeled nodes (going from lower to higher labeled nodes) and count the triangles:  
- Edge (0, 2): shared connection with 4 forms triangle <0, 2, 4>.  
- Edge (0, 7): no triangles formed.  
- Edge (1, 4): shared connection with 0 forms triangle <0, 1, 4>.  
- Edge (3, 4): shared connection with 0 forms triangle <0, 3, 4>.  
- Edge (3, 8): shared connection with 4 forms triangle <3, 8, 4>.  
- Edge (4, 5): shared connection forms triangle <4, 5, 8>.  
- Edge (4, 6): shared connection forms triangle <4, 6, 9>.  
- Edge (7, 8): shared connection forms triangle <7, 8, 4>.  
- Edge (8, 9): shared connection forms triangle <8, 9, 4>.  

There are a total of 9 triangles in the graph, and they are:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 1, 4>  
<0, 3, 4>  
<3, 8, 4>  
<4, 5, 8>  
<4, 6, 9>  
<7, 8, 4>  
<8, 9, 4>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
