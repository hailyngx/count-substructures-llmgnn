Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections, we have the following order: <5, 3, 8, 6, 0, 4, 9, 1, 2, 7>.

Using this order, we will now count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 2) forms the triangle <0, 2, 1>.
- Edge (0, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 4) forms the triangle <0, 4, 1>.
- Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 2) forms the triangle <1, 2, 0>.
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 0) forms the triangle <2, 0, 1>.
- Edge (2, 1) forms the triangle <2, 1, 0>.
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 1>, <0, 4, 1>, <1, 2, 0>, <2, 0, 1>, <2, 1, 0>.
