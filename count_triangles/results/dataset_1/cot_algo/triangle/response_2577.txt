Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following relabeling:
Nodes: (Degree, New Label)
0: (2, 0)
3: (3, 1)
5: (3, 2)
6: (1, 3)
8: (3, 4)
9: (4, 5)
1: (5, 6)
7: (4, 7)
2: (4, 8)
4: (5, 9)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. Starting with edge (0, 4): Node 0 has degree 2 and Node 4 has degree 5, proceed.
   Shared connections between 0 and 4 = (9).
   
2. Moving to edge (0, 9): Node 0 and Node 9 both have degree 4. Since Node 0 is labeled with a smaller degree, proceed.
   Shared connections between 0 and 9 = (4).

3. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 has degree 5 and Node 4 has degree 5, proceed.
   Shared connections between 1 and 4 = (9, 0).

4. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 has degree 5 and Node 5 has degree 3, proceed.
   Shared connections between 1 and 5 = (3).

5. Edge (1, 7): Node 1 has degree 5 and Node 7 has degree 4, proceed.
   Shared connections between 1 and 7 = (8, 9).

6. Edge (1, 8): Node 1 has degree 5 and Node 8 has degree 3, proceed.
   Shared connections between 1 and 8 = (7).

7. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 has degree 5 and Node 9 has degree 4, proceed.
   Shared connections between 1 and 9 = (4, 7).

8. Edge (2, 3): Node 2 has degree 4 and Node 3 has degree 3, proceed.
  Shared connections between 2 and 3 = (4).

9. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 has degree 4 and Node 4 has degree 5, proceed.
  Shared connections between 2 and 4 = (9).

The total number of triangles is [10].

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 9>
