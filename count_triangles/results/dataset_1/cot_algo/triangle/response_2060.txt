Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, we need to find the connections each vertex has:

- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 9: 2 connections

By the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

- Node 1 (1 connection) -> Node 0
- Node 3 (1 connection) -> Node 1
- Node 4 (1 connection) -> Node 2
- Node 6 (1 connection) -> Node 3
- Node 8 (1 connection) -> Node 4
- Node 5 (2 connections) -> Node 5
- Node 9 (2 connections) -> Node 6
- Node 7 (3 connections) -> Node 7
- Node 0 (2 connections) -> Node 8
- Node 2 (5 connections) -> Node 9

We can now process the edges in order:

1. (0, 2): Check for shared connections - None.
2. (0, 9): Check for shared connections - None.
3. (1, 9): Check for shared connections - None.
4. (2, 0): Check for shared connections - None.
5. (2, 3): Check for shared connections - None.
6. (2, 6): Check for shared connections - None.
7. (2, 7): Check for shared connections - None.
8. (3, 2): Check for shared connections - None.
9. (4, 8): Check for shared connections - None.
10. (5, 7): Check for shared connections - None.
11. (6, 2): Check for shared connections - None.
12. (7, 2): Shared connection with node 5. Triangle <5, 7, 2>.
13. (7, 5): Check for shared connections - None.
14. (8, 4): Check for shared connections - None.
15. (9, 0): Check for shared connections - None.
16. (9, 1): Check for shared connections - None.

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles: <5, 7, 2>
