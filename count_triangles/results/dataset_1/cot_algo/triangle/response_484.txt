Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices with their connections are as follows:
- Vertex 0: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 6 connections
- Vertex 2: 5 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections

Sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have: 0, 4, 8, 3, 6, 7, 5, 9, 2, 1.

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For vertex 0: No triangles can be formed.
- For vertex 4: No triangles can be formed.
- For vertex 8: No triangles can be formed.
- For vertex 3: No triangles can be formed.
- For vertex 6: Triangles: <1, 6, 0>.
- For vertex 7: Triangles: <1, 7, 5>.
- For vertex 5: Triangles: <1, 5, 7>.
- For vertex 9: Triangles: <1, 9, 2>, <1, 9, 5>.
- For vertex 2: Triangles: <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [7]
