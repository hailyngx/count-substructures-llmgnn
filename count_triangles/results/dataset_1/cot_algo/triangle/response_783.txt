Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on the number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 1 (0): Connections - 2
Node 2 (5): Connections - 4
Node 3 (6): Connections - 4
Node 4 (7): Connections - 2
Node 5 (2): Connections - 3
Node 6 (4): Connections - 5
Node 7 (8): Connections - 3
Node 8 (9): Connections - 3
Node 9 (3): Connections - 3
Node 10 (4): Connections - 5

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the edges, we consider only those edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (0, 5) - Nodes 0 and 5 form a triangle with Node 4: <0, 5, 4>
2. (0, 6) - Nodes 0 and 6 do not form a triangle.
3. (2, 4) - Nodes 2 and 4 do not form a triangle.
4. (3, 6) - Nodes 3 and 6 do not form a triangle.
5. (4, 5) - Nodes 4 and 5 do not form a triangle.
6. (7, 5) - Nodes 7 and 5 do not form a triangle.
7. (8, 4) - Nodes 8 and 4 do not form a triangle.
8. (9, 3) - Nodes 9 and 3 do not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] (only <0, 5, 4>).
