Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, then relabeling the vertices accordingly.

After sorting the nodes by degree, the new labels are:
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 6 connections.

Now we can count the triangles based on the given edges by checking if the lower labeled vertex in each edge has fewer connections. 

The total number of triangles is [7].

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 9, 4>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
