Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 2
|    |
1 -- 7 -- 4
|  / |  /
8    6 - 9
```

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 3: degree 0
- Node 5: degree 0
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4

We will start by counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 2):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - Both have 2 connections.
   - Proceed to check for shared connections:
     - Both are connected to vertex 1, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.

2. Edge (1, 2):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - Vertex 1 has 3 connections which is more than 2's 4 connections, so we skip this edge.

3. Edge (1, 7):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - Both have 3 connections.
   - Proceed to check for shared connections:
     - Both are connected to vertices 2 and 4, forming triangles <1, 2, 4> and <1, 4, 7>.

4. Edge (1, 8):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - Both have 3 connections.
   - Proceed to check for shared connections:
     - Both are connected to vertex 2, forming a triangle <1, 2, 8>.

5. Edge (2, 0):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - 0 has 2 connections which is less than 2's 4 connections.
   - Proceed to check for shared connections:
     - Both are connected to vertex 1, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.

6. Edge (2, 1):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - 1 has 3 connections which is more than 2's 4 connections, so we skip this edge.

7. Edge (4, 7):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - Both have 2 connections.
   - Proceed to check for shared connections:
     - Both are connected to vertices 1 and 6, forming a triangle <4, 1, 7> and <4, 6, 7>.

8. Edge (6, 7):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - 6 has 3 connections which is less than 7's 4 connections.
   - Proceed to check for shared connections:
     - Both are connected to vertices 1 and 4, forming a triangle <6, 1, 7> and <6, 4, 7>.

9. Edge (6, 9):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - Both have 2 connections.
   - Proceed to check for shared connections:
     - No triangles are formed with this edge.

10. Edge (7, 1):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - 1 has 3 connections which is less than 7's 4 connections.
   - Proceed to check for shared connections:
     - Both are connected to vertices 2 and 4, forming a triangle <1, 2, 7> and <1, 4, 7>.

11. Edge (7, 4):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - 4 has 2 connections which is less than 7's 4 connections.
   - Proceed to check for shared connections:
     - Both are connected to vertices 1 and 6, forming a triangle <4, 1, 7> and <4, 6, 7>.

12. Edge (7, 6):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - Both have 3 connections.
   - Proceed to check for shared connections:
     - Both are connected to vertices 1 and 4, forming a triangle <6, 1, 7> and <6, 4, 7>.

13. Edge (8, 1):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - 8 has 2 connections which is less than 1's 3 connections.
   - Proceed to check for shared connections:
     - Both are connected to vertex 2, forming a triangle <1, 2, 8>.

14. Edge (9, 6):
   - Verify if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
     - Both have 2 connections.
   - Proceed to check for shared connections:
     - No triangles are formed with this edge.

So, the total number of triangles is [8], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 1, 7>, and <6, 4, 7>.
