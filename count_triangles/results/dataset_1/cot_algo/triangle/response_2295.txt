Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees. Here are the vertices sorted by their degrees:

0: degree 4
1: degree 4
3: degree 4
5: degree 3
6: degree 3
8: degree 3
9: degree 2
7: degree 2
4: degree 2
2: degree 0

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles.

Starting with the edge (0, 1):
Both vertices have degree 4, so we proceed.
0 and 1 share 1 common connection: vertex 9.
Thus, <0, 1, 9> forms a triangle.

Moving on to the edge (0, 3):
Both vertices have degree 4, so we proceed.
0 and 3 share 2 common connections: vertices 6 and 9.
Thus, <0, 3, 6> and <0, 3, 9> each form a triangle.

Continuing in this manner, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 7>

Counting the total number of triangles:
[10]

So, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
