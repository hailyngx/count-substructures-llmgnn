Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees from least to most, the new labeling is as follows: 

0 -> 4 connections  
1 -> 2 connections  
7 -> 4 connections  
8 -> 4 connections  
6 -> 4 connections  
5 -> 4 connections  
9 -> 4 connections  
3 -> 5 connections  
4 -> 7 connections  
2 -> 8 connections  

Now, we will go through each edge to count the number of triangles:  

(0, 2): No triangle  
(0, 4): No triangle  
(1, 7): No triangle  
(1, 8): No triangle  
(2, 0): No triangle  
(2, 4): No triangle  
(2, 9): No triangle  
(3, 4): Triangle formed with 0 and 2 -> <0, 2, 4>  
(3, 7): No triangle  
(3, 8): No triangle  
(3, 9): No triangle  
(4, 0): No triangle  
(4, 2): No triangle  
(4, 3): Triangle formed with 0 and 2 -> <0, 2, 4>  
(4, 5): No triangle  
(4, 6): No triangle  
(5, 4): No triangle  
(5, 7): No triangle  
(5, 8): No triangle  
(5, 9): No triangle  
(6, 4): No triangle  
(6, 7): No triangle  
(6, 8): No triangle  
(6, 9): No triangle  
(7, 1): No triangle  
(7, 3): No triangle  
(7, 5): No triangle  
(7, 6): No triangle  
(8, 1): No triangle  
(8, 3): No triangle  
(8, 5): No triangle  
(8, 6): No triangle  
(9, 2): No triangle  
(9, 3): No triangle  
(9, 5): No triangle  
(9, 6): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [2]  
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>
