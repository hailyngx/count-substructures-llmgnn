Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in increasing order, we have the following relabeling:
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 1
- Node 9: Degree 1
- Node 4: Degree 1
- Node 7: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 4

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle <1, 3, 6>.
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 1) forms a triangle <1, 3, 6>.
- Edge (3, 6) forms a triangle <1, 3, 6>.
- Edge (3, 7) forms a triangle <1, 3, 7>.
- Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 3) forms a triangle <1, 3, 7>.
- Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>.
