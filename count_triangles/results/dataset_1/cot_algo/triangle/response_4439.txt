Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the total number of triangles to be [6]. 

The unique triangles are:
- <1, 2, 8>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <7, 8, 3>
