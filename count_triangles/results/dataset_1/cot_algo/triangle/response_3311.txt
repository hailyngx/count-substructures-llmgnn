Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following order: 4, 7, 3, 1, 6, 5, 8, 2, 0, 9.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles present in the graph:

1. Checking vertex 4 (degree 2):
   - Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 7. (4, 7, 9) => <4, 7, 9>
   - Edge (4, 9): Forms a triangle with vertex 9. (4, 7, 9) => <4, 7, 9>
   
2. Checking vertex 7 (degree 2):
   - No new triangles formed.

3. Checking vertex 3 (degree 2):
   - Edge (3, 2): Forms a triangle with vertex 2. (2, 3, 5) => <2, 3, 5>
   - Edge (3, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 5. (2, 3, 5) => <2, 3, 5>
   
4. Checking vertex 1 (degree 3):
   - Edge (1, 2): Forms a triangle with vertex 2. (1, 2, 0) => <1, 2, 0>
   
5. Checking vertex 6 (degree 2):
   - No new triangles formed.

6. Checking vertex 5 (degree 4):
   - Edge (5, 2): Forms a triangle with vertex 2. (5, 2, 0) => <5, 2, 0>
   - Edge (5, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 3. (5, 2, 3) => <5, 2, 3>
   - Edge (5, 8): Forms a triangle with vertex 8. (8, 5, 0) => <8, 5, 0>
  
7. Checking vertex 8 (degree 4):
   - No new triangles formed.
  
8. Checking vertex 2 (degree 4):
   - No new triangles formed.
  
9. Checking vertex 0 (degree 6):
   - No new triangles formed.
  
10. Checking vertex 9 (degree 6):
   - No new triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <4, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 0>, <5, 2, 0>, and <8, 5, 0>.
