Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Now, analyzing the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 2): Nodes 0 and 2 have 5 connections each, forming a triangle with shared connection 5.
- Edge (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 have 5 and 3 connections, respectively, forming a triangle with shared connections 4, 6.
- Edge (0, 7): Nodes 0 and 7 have 5 and 2 connections, respectively, forming a triangle with shared connection 6.
- Edge (0, 8): Nodes 0 and 8 have 5 and 4 connections, respectively, forming a triangle with shared connection 1.
- Edge (1, 2): Nodes 1 and 2 have 4 connections each, forming a triangle with shared connections 9, 8.
- Edge (1, 8): Nodes 1 and 8 have 4 connections each, forming a triangle with shared connection 0.
- Edge (1, 9): Nodes 1 and 9 have 4 and 3 connections, respectively, forming a triangle with shared connections 2.
- Edge (2, 9): Nodes 2 and 9 have 5 and 3 connections, respectively, forming a triangle with shared connection 1.
- Edge (6, 7): Nodes 6 and 7 have 4 and 2 connections, respectively, forming a triangle with shared connection 0.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in total, and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
