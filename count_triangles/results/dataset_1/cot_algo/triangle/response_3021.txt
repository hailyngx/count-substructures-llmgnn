Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices can be relabeled based on their number of connections in ascending order:

Vertex 3 (Degree 3)
Vertex 6 (Degree 2)
Vertex 7 (Degree 3)
Vertex 5 (Degree 3)
Vertex 2 (Degree 3)
Vertex 1 (Degree 4)
Vertex 8 (Degree 4)
Vertex 0 (Degree 5)
Vertex 4 (Degree 6)

Now, we proceed to count the triangles formed by the edges:
1. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 1>
4. Triangle <0, 4, 3>
5. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
6. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
7. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
8. Triangle <2, 1, 8>
9. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
10. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
11. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
