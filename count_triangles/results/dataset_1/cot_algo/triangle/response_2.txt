Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling: 
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 6 has degree 6
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 2

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Checking edge (0, 6): Both nodes have different degrees (2 and 6), so we proceed. They share one connection: node 5. 
Checking edge (1, 3): Both nodes have different degrees (3 and 4), so we proceed. They share one connection: node 2.
Checking edge (1, 5): Both nodes have different degrees (3 and 5), so we proceed. They share one connection: node 3.
Checking edge (2, 3): Both nodes have different degrees (3 and 4), so we proceed. They share one connection: node 1.
Checking edge (2, 4): Both nodes have different degrees (3 and 4), so we proceed. They share one connection: node 8.
Checking edge (2, 6): Node 2 has a lower degree than node 6, so we proceed. They share one connection: node 5.
Checking edge (3, 1): Node 1 has a lower degree than node 3, so we proceed. They share one connection: node 2.
Checking edge (3, 2): Node 2 has a lower degree than node 3, so we proceed. They share one connection: node 1.
Checking edge (3, 5): Both nodes have different degrees (4 and 5), so we proceed. They share one connection: node 1.
Checking edge (4, 2): Node 2 has a lower degree than node 4, so we proceed. They share one connection: node 8.
Checking edge (4, 7): Both nodes have different degrees (4 and 4), so we proceed. They share one connection: node 8.
Checking edge (4, 8): Node 4 has a lower degree than node 8, so we proceed. They share one connection: node 2.
Checking edge (5, 1): Node 1 has a lower degree than node 5, so we proceed. They share one connection: node 3.
Checking edge (5, 3): Node 3 has a lower degree than node 5, so we proceed. They share one connection: node 1.
Checking edge (5, 6): Node 5 has a lower degree than node 6, so we proceed. They share two connections: nodes 2 and 3.
Checking edge (5, 7): Both nodes have different degrees (5 and 4), so we proceed. They share one connection: node 8.
Checking edge (5, 8): Node 5 has a lower degree than node 8, so we proceed. They share one connection: node 4.
Checking edge (6, 0): Node 0 has a lower degree than node 6, so we proceed. They share one connection: node 5.
