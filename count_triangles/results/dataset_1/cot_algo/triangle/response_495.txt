Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
As per the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is: 

0 - 2 connections  
5 - 1 connection  
6 - 1 connection  
7 - 1 connection  
9 - 2 connections  
8 - 4 connections  
1 - 4 connections  
3 - 4 connections  

Following the method of counting triangles:
- For edge (0, 1), vertex 0 has 2 connections and vertex 1 has 4 connections. Since vertex 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   - Vertex 0 shares connections with vertices 3 and 1, forming the triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- For edge (0, 3), we skip this edge since vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 3.
- For edge (1, 5), we skip this edge as the order of vertices by connections doesn't match.
- For edge (1, 7), we skip this edge as the order of vertices by connections doesn't match.
- For edge (1, 8), both vertices have the same number of connections. We proceed as vertex 1 has a lower label.
   - Vertex 1 shares connections with vertices 0 and 8, forming the triangle <0, 1, 8>.
- For edge (1, 8), we skip this edge as the triangle formed was already counted.
- For edge (1, 7), we skip this edge as the order of vertices by connections doesn't match.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3> and <0, 1, 8>.
