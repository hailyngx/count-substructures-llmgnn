Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 1: 0 (degree 5)
Node 2: 8 (degree 3)
Node 3: 9 (degree 3)
Node 4: 5 (degree 3)
Node 5: 3 (degree 3)
Node 6: 7 (degree 3)
Node 7: 4 (degree 2)
Node 8: 2 (degree 2)
Node 9: 6 (degree 1)
Node 10: 1 (degree 0)

Now, we go through the edges in the order given and count the triangles:

(0, 2): No triangle
(0, 3): Triangle <2, 3, 5> found
(0, 4): Triangle <0, 4, 3> found
(0, 6): No triangle
(0, 9): No triangle
(2, 0): No triangle
(2, 5): No triangle
(2, 7): No triangle
(3, 0): No triangle
(3, 4): Triangle <0, 4, 3> found
(3, 5): Triangle <2, 3, 5> found
(3, 9): No triangle
(4, 0): Triangle <0, 4, 3> found
(4, 3): No triangle
(4, 5): No triangle
(5, 2): No triangle
(5, 3): Triangle <2, 3, 5> found
(5, 4): No triangle
(5, 8): No triangle
(6, 0): No triangle
(7, 2): No triangle
(7, 8): No triangle
(7, 9): No triangle
(8, 5): No triangle
(8, 7): No triangle
(9, 0): No triangle
(9, 3): No triangle
(9, 7): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <2, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 3>.
