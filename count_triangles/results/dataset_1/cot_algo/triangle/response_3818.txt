Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices. 

The sorted nodes based on their degree are as follows:
Node 0: 0 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 6: 3 edges
Node 9: 3 edges
Node 8: 3 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 2: 7 edges

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

1. Processing edge (0, 2): Node 0 does not have fewer connections than Node 2.
2. Processing edge (1, 2): Node 1 does not have fewer connections than Node 2.
3. Processing edge (1, 5): Node 1 does not have fewer connections than Node 5.
4. Processing edge (1, 6): Node 1 does not have fewer connections than Node 6.
5. Processing edge (1, 8): Node 1 does not have fewer connections than Node 8.
6. Processing edge (2, 0): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 0. Triangle found: <0, 2, 1>.
7. Processing edge (2, 1): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 1. Triangle found: <0, 2, 1>.
8. Processing edge (2, 3): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 3. Triangle found: <1, 2, 3>.
9. Processing edge (2, 5): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 5. Triangle found: <1, 2, 5>.
10. Processing edge (2, 7): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 7. Triangle found: <1, 2, 7>.
11. Processing edge (2, 8): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 8. Triangle found: <1, 2, 8>.
12. Processing edge (3, 2): Node 3 does not have fewer connections than Node 2.
13. Processing edge (3, 7): Node 3 does not have fewer connections than Node 7.

17. Processing edge (4, 7): Node 4 does not have fewer connections than Node 7.
18. Processing edge (4, 9): Node 4 does not have fewer connections than Node 9.
19. Processing edge (5, 1): Node 5 does not have fewer connections than Node 1.
20. Processing edge (5, 2): Node 5 does not have fewer connections than Node 2.
21. Processing edge (5, 4): Node 5 does not have fewer connections than Node 4.
22. Processing edge (5, 6): Node 5 does not have fewer connections than Node 6.
23. Processing edge (6, 1): Node 6 does not have fewer connections than Node 1.
24. Processing edge (6, 5): Node 6 does not have fewer connections than Node 5.
