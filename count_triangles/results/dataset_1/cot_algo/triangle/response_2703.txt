Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Node 0 - 4 connections
Node 2 - 2 connections
Node 3 - 4 connections
Node 5 - 4 connections
Node 6 - 1 connection
Node 7 - 4 connections
Node 8 - 4 connections
Node 9 - 2 connections
Node 4 - 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider each edge. 

- Edge (0, 2): Both nodes 0 and 2 have fewer connections than node 4, so they form a triangle with node 4. 
- Edge (0, 4): As node 0 has fewer connections than node 4, they form a triangle with nodes 2 and 7. 
- Edge (0, 7): As node 0 has fewer connections than node 7, they form a triangle with nodes 4 and 5. 
- Edge (0, 9): As node 0 has fewer connections than node 9, they form a triangle with node 5. 
- Edge (2, 4): As node 2 has fewer connections than node 4, they form a triangle with nodes 0 and 7. 
- Edge (3, 4): Both nodes 3 and 4 have fewer connections than node 5, so they form a triangle with node 8. 
- Edge (3, 5): As node 3 has fewer connections than node 5, they form a triangle with nodes 4 and 8. 
- Edge (3, 7): As node 3 has fewer connections than node 7, they form a triangle with nodes 0 and 8. 
- Edge (3, 8): As node 3 has fewer connections than node 8, they form a triangle with nodes 4 and 7. 
- Edge (4, 6): Both nodes 4 and 6 have fewer connections than node 5, so they form a triangle with node 8. 
- Edge (4, 8): As node 4 has fewer connections than node 8, they form a triangle with nodes 3 and 7. 
- Edge (5, 7): Both nodes 5 and 7 have fewer connections than node 8, so they form a triangle with node 3. 
- Edge (5, 8): As node 5 has fewer connections than node 8, they form a triangle with nodes 4 and 7. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 8>.
