Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the new node order is: 8, 5, 7, 1, 3, 4, 0, 6, 2, 9.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 4> 
<0, 4, 6> 
<0, 6, 9> 
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 9> 
<1, 6, 9> 
<3, 5, 7> 
<3, 6, 9> 

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
