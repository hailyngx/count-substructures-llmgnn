Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 2

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order and relabel them:
- Node 6 (degree 1) -> Node 0
- Node 7 (degree 1) -> Node 1
- Node 8 (degree 1) -> Node 2
- Node 2 (degree 1) -> Node 3
- Node 3 (degree 2) -> Node 4
- Node 5 (degree 2) -> Node 5
- Node 7 (degree 2) -> Node 6
- Node 0 (degree 2) -> Node 7
- Node 1 (degree 2) -> Node 8
- Node 4 (degree 4) -> Node 9

Now, we iterate through the edges following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (0, 1): Node 0 (1) has fewer connections than Node 1 (1). No triangles formed.
2. (0, 4): Node 0 (1) has fewer connections than Node 4 (4). Shared connection with Node 1 forms a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
3. (1, 9): Node 1 (1) has fewer connections than Node 9 (2). No triangles formed.
4. (2, 8): Node 2 (1) has fewer connections than Node 8 (1). No triangles formed.
5. (3, 9): Node 3 (2) has fewer connections than Node 9 (2). No triangles formed.
6. (4, 0): Node 4 (4) has fewer connections than Node 0 (1). Shared connection with Node 1 forms a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
7. (4, 5): Node 4 (4) has fewer connections than Node 5 (2). Shared connection with Node 0 forms a triangle <0, 4, 5>.
8. (4, 6): Node 4 (4) has fewer connections than Node 6 (1). No triangles formed.
9. (5, 7): Node 5 (2) has fewer connections than Node 7 (1). No triangles formed.
10. (8, 2): Node 8 (1) has fewer connections than Node 2 (1). No triangles formed.
11. (9, 1): Node 9 (2) has fewer connections than Node 1 (1). No triangles formed.
12. (9, 3): Node 9 (2) has fewer connections than Node 3 (2). No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 5>
