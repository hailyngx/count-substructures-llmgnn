Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their degrees:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 1
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 2

Now, let's reorder the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes in order: 5, 0, 1, 9, 3, 7, 6, 2, 4, 8

Now, let's go through the edges and count the triangles:
Triangles: [9]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
