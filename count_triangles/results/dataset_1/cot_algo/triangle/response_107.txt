Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree of connections from least to most, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:  

Node 0 has degree 2  
Node 4 has degree 2  
Node 6 has degree 2  
Node 9 has degree 2  

Node 3 has degree 3  
Node 5 has degree 3  
Node 7 has degree 3  

Node 1 has degree 4  
Node 8 has degree 4  

Now we will check for triangles based on the degree-based ordering method:

For edge (0, 1):  
    Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8  
    Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8  
    The shared connection between nodes 0 and 1 is node 8, forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.

For edge (1, 3):  
    Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8  
    Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8  
    The shared connection between nodes 1 and 3 is node 8, forming a triangle <1, 3, 8>.

For edge (3, 7):  
    Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8  
    Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 4  
    The shared connection between nodes 3 and 7 is node 8, forming a triangle <3, 7, 8>.

The total number of triangles is [3] which are <0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, and <3, 7, 8>.
