Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labelings are as follows:
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 7 connections
Vertex 0: 8 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 3), (6, 7), (6, 2), (7, 9), (2, 4), (2, 8), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 9), (8, 0), (8, 2), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 7), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 9), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 9)

By examining the shared connections for each pair of vertices from the above edges, we find the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is: [10]
Unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<4, 2, 9>
<4, 9, 5>
<5, 8, 9>
<1, 9, 7>
