Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labels are: 

Node 8 - degree 2
Node 4 - degree 2
Node 1 - degree 3
Node 9 - degree 3
Node 0 - degree 4
Node 3 - degree 4
Node 5 - degree 4
Node 7 - degree 4
Node 2 - degree 6
Node 6 - degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles and list them:

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<1, 8, 9>
