Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by the number of connections:
- Vertex 0 has 5 connections
- Vertex 1 has 3 connections
- Vertex 2 has 3 connections
- Vertex 3 has 4 connections
- Vertex 4 has 3 connections
- Vertex 5 has 2 connections
- Vertex 6 has 2 connections
- Vertex 7 has 4 connections
- Vertex 8 has 2 connections
- Vertex 9 has 4 connections

2. Relabel the vertices based on their connections:
- Vertex 0 -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 1 -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 2 -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 3 -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 4 -> Vertex 9
- Vertex 5 -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 6 -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 7 -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 8 -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 9 -> Vertex 3

Now, following the edge connections where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

- Check the edge (0, 1): Vertex 5 and Vertex 8 share a connection with Vertex 4 forming a triangle <5, 8, 4>.
- Check the edge (0, 3): No triangle forms.
- Check the edge (0, 4): Vertex 5 and Vertex 9 share a connection with Vertex 8 forming a triangle <5, 9, 8>.
- Check the edge (0, 7): No triangle forms.
- Check the edge (0, 9): Vertex 5 and Vertex 3 share a connection with Vertex 8 forming a triangle <5, 3, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
