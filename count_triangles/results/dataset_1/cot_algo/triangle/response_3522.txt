Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. After relabeling the vertices accordingly, the sorted list of vertices is as follows:
(3, 1) (8, 0) (7, 5) (6, 1) (5, 2) (9, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (4, 6)

Following the method, we will now check each edge to count the number of triangles.

Triangles:
<1, 0, 4>
<3, 1, 4>
<5, 2, 4>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
