Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new ordering is as follows: 5, 0, 1, 8, 9, 3, 4, 6, 2, 7.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle <7, 6, 1>
- Triangle <7, 8, 1>
- Triangle <7, 6, 2>
- Triangle <7, 0, 2>
- Triangle <8, 1, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
