Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for this graph is as follows:

Node 0 has degree 2.
Node 5 has degree 1.
Node 8 has degree 2.
Node 4 has degree 3.
Node 7 has degree 3.
Node 9 has degree 2.
Node 1 has degree 6.
Node 6 has degree 4.
Node 2 has degree 4.
Node 3 has degree 7.

The sorted order based on degrees is: 5, 0, 8, 9, 4, 7, 2, 6, 1, 3.

Following the method outlined earlier, we find that there are 8 triangles in the graph: 
[<1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 3>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 7, 3>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
