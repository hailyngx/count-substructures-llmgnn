Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most as follows: 

Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 0: 1 connection  
Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 9: 4 connections  
Node 7: 5 connections  

Following the provided edges while obeying the condition that the lower labeled vertex should have fewer connections, we find the triangles and count them: 

1. Triangle <1, 3, 7>  
2. Triangle <0, 7, 9>  
3. Triangle <8, 9, 4>  
4. Triangle <2, 6, 7>  
5. Triangle <5, 6, 7>  
6. Triangle <3, 5, 7>  
7. Triangle <4, 5, 8>  
8. Triangle <5, 8, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
