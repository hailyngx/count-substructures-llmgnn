Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices:  
2 -> 1 connection  
4 -> 1 connection  
7 -> 2 connections  
6 -> 2 connections  
1 -> 2 connections  
0 -> 2 connections  
9 -> 3 connections  
5 -> 4 connections  
3 -> 4 connections  
8 -> 6 connections  

We will now use this ordering to count the triangles:

Triangles:  
\[5, 8, 9\]  
\[3, 6, 8\]  
\[0, 3, 5\]  
\[0, 5, 9\]

Total number of triangles: [4]
