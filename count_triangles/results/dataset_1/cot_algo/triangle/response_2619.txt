Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be: 

0 - 1 connection
2 - 1 connection
5 - 1 connection
7 - 1 connection
3 - 2 connections
9 - 2 connections
1 - 3 connections
4 - 4 connections
6 - 6 connections
8 - 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze each edge based on the label of its lower vertex:

(0, 8) - Both vertices have 1 connection.
(2, 6) - Both vertices have 1 connection.
(3, 4) - Vertex 3 has 2 connections (lower label), vertex 4 has 4 connections:
   - Shared connections: 6
(3, 6) - Vertex 3 has 2 connections (lower label), vertex 6 has 6 connections:
   - Shared connections: None
(4, 3) - Vertex 3 has 2 connections (lower label), vertex 4 has 4 connections:
   - Shared connections: 6
(4, 6) - Vertex 4 has 4 connections (lower label), vertex 6 has 6 connections:
   - Shared connections: 3
(4, 8) - Vertex 4 has 4 connections (lower label), vertex 8 has 6 connections:
   - Shared connections: None
(4, 9) - Vertex 4 has 4 connections (lower label), vertex 9 has 2 connections:
   - Shared connections: None
(5, 7) - Both vertices have 1 connection.
(6, 2) - Vertex 2 has 1 connection (lower label), vertex 6 has 6 connections:
   - Shared connections: None
(6, 3) - Vertex 3 has 2 connections (lower label), vertex 6 has 6 connections:
   - Shared connections: None
(6, 4) - Vertex 4 has 4 connections (lower label), vertex 6 has 6 connections:
   - Shared connections: 3
(6, 8) - Vertex 6 has 6 connections (lower label), vertex 8 has 6 connections:
   - Shared connections: None
(6, 9) - Vertex 6 has 6 connections (lower label), vertex 9 has 2 connections:
   - Shared connections: None
(7, 5) - Both vertices have 1 connection.
(7, 8) - Vertex 7 has 1 connection (lower label), vertex 8 has 6 connections:
   - Shared connections: None
(8, 0) - Vertex 0 has 1 connection (lower label), vertex 8 has 6 connections:
   - Shared connections: None
(8, 4) - Vertex 4 has 4 connections (lower label), vertex 8 has 6 connections:
   - Shared connections: None
(8, 6) - Vertex 6 has 6 connections (lower label), vertex 8 has 6 connections:
   - Shared connections: 4
(8, 7) - Vertex 7 has 1 connection (lower label), vertex 8 has 6 connections:
   - Shared connections: None
(9, 4) - Vertex 4 has 4 connections (lower label), vertex 9 has 2 connections:
   - Shared connections: None
(9, 6) - Vertex 6 has 6 connections (lower label), vertex 9 has 2 connections:
   - Shared connections: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <3, 4, 6>.
