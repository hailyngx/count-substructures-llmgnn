Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph.

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: <5, 1, 9, 7, 6, 3, 2, 4, 8, 0>.

By following the method, we find the total number of triangles inside brackets [] to be [5].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 8>.
