Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following relabeling:
Vertices: (6, 0, 2, 4, 1, 9, 3, 8, 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. Edge (0, 4): Both 0 and 4 are connected to 5, forming a triangle <0, 4, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 5): Both 0 and 5 are connected to 1 and 3, forming two triangles <0, 5, 1> and <0, 5, 3>.
3. Edge (0, 6): No triangles can be formed.
4. Edge (1, 2): No triangles can be formed.
5. Edge (1, 5): Both 1 and 5 are connected to 0, 3, and 8, forming three triangles <1, 5, 0>, <1, 5, 3>, and <1, 5, 8>.
6. Edge (1, 8): Both 1 and 8 are connected to 3 and 5, forming a triangle <1, 8, 5>.
7. Edge (2, 1): No triangles can be formed.
8. Edge (2, 3): No triangles can be formed.
9. Edge (3, 2): No triangles can be formed.
10. Edge (3, 5): Both 3 and 5 are connected to 0, 1, and 8, forming three triangles <3, 5, 0>, <3, 5, 1>, and <3, 5, 8>.
11. Edge (3, 8): Both 3 and 8 are connected to 1, 4, and 5, forming three triangles <3, 8, 1>, <3, 8, 4>, and <3, 8, 5>.
12. Edge (3, 9): No triangles can be formed.
13. Edge (4, 0): Both 4 and 0 are connected to 8 and 5, forming two triangles <4, 0, 8> and <4, 0, 5>.
14. Edge (4, 8): No triangles can be formed.
15. Edge (5, 0): Both 5 and 0 are connected to 1 and 3, forming two triangles <5, 0, 1> and <5, 0, 3>.
16. Edge (5, 1): No triangles can be formed.
17. Edge (5, 3): No triangles can be formed.
18. Edge (5, 8): Both 5 and 8 are connected to 0 and 1, forming two triangles <5, 8, 0> and <5, 8, 1>.
19. Edge (5, 9): No triangles can be formed.
20. Edge (6, 9): No triangles can be formed.
21. Edge (8, 1): No triangles can be formed.
22. Edge (8, 3): No triangles can be formed.
23. Edge (8, 4): No triangles can be formed.
24. Edge (8, 5): No triangles can be formed.
25. Edge (9, 3): No triangles can be formed.
26. Edge (9, 5): No triangles can be formed.
27. Edge (9, 6): No triangles can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 0>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 8, 5>, <3, 5, 0>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 8, 1>, and <3, 8, 5>.
