Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Let's relabel the vertices accordingly:

Node 3 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 1 connection.
Nodes 1 and 7 are tied with 2 connections each, so let's give Node 1 a lower label.
Nodes 0, 5, and 9 are tied with 2 connections each, so let's give Node 0 a lower label.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Nodes 2 and 6 are tied with 5 connections each, so let's give Node 2 a lower label.
Node 4 has 5 connections.

Now, let's go through the edges and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): Node 0 < Node 2, Node 0 and Node 2 have a shared connection with Node 1 forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (0, 7): Not processed.
- Edge (1, 2): Node 1 < Node 2, Node 1 and Node 2 have a shared connection with Node 0 forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (1, 4): Node 1 < Node 4, Node 1 and Node 4 have a shared connection with Node 2 forming a triangle <1, 2, 4>.
- Edge (2, 0): Not processed.
- Edge (2, 1): Not processed.
- Edge (2, 4): Node 2 < Node 4, Node 2 and Node 4 have a shared connection with Node 1 forming a triangle <1, 2, 4>.
- Edge (3, 8): Not processed.
- Edge (4, 1): Not processed.
- Edge (4, 2): Not processed.
- Edge (4, 6): Node 4 < Node 6, Node 4 and Node 6 have a shared connection with Node 5 forming a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
- Edge (4, 9): Node 4 < Node 9, Node 4 and Node 9 have a shared connection with Node 6 forming a triangle <4, 6, 9>.
- Edge (5, 6): Not processed.
- Edge (5, 8): Not processed.
- Edge (6, 4): Not processed.
- Edge (6, 5): Not processed.
- Edge (6, 9): Not processed.
- Edge (7, 0): Not processed.
- Edge (8, 3): Not processed.
- Edge (8, 5): Not processed.
- Edge (8, 9): Not processed.
- Edge (9, 4): Not processed.
- Edge (9, 6): Not processed.
- Edge (9, 8): Not processed.

The total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 4>, and <4, 5, 6>.
