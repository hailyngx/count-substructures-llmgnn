Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Nodes sorted by degree: 9, 2, 5, 7, 1, 2, 6, 8, 4, 0

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

For edge (0, 1): 0 and 1 have 6 common neighbors - (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) forming 1 triangle <0, 1, 3>.
For edge (0, 3): 0 and 3 have 1 common neighbor - (4) forming 1 triangle <0, 3, 4>.
For edge (0, 4): 0 and 4 have 1 common neighbor - (6) forming 1 triangle <0, 4, 6>.
For edge (0, 5): No triangle found.
For edge (0, 6): 0 and 6 have 1 common neighbor - (4) forming 1 triangle <0, 6, 4>.
For edge (0, 7): No triangle found.
For edge (1, 3): 1 and 3 have 1 common neighbor - (0) forming 1 triangle <1, 3, 0>.
For edge (1, 6): 1 and 6 have 1 common neighbor - (0) forming 1 triangle <1, 6, 0>.
For edge (2, 3): No triangle found.
For edge (3, 4): 3 and 4 have 1 common neighbor - (0) forming 1 triangle <3, 4, 0>.
For edge (4, 6): 4 and 6 have 1 common neighbor - (0) forming 1 triangle <4, 6, 0>.
For edge (4, 7): No triangle found.
For edge (4, 8): 4 and 8 have 1 common neighbor - (6) forming 1 triangle <4, 8, 6>.
For edge (5, 6): No triangle found.
For edge (6, 8): 6 and 8 have 1 common neighbor - (4) forming 1 triangle <6, 8, 4>.
For edge (8, 9): No triangle found.

Total number of triangles: [6]

The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 0>, <1, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 0>
