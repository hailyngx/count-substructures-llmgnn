Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Reordering the nodes based on their degree:
Edges sorted in increasing order of their incident nodes' degrees: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 8) (8, 9)

Triangles formed based on shared connections:
<3, 5, 7> <3, 5, 6> <3, 6, 7>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
