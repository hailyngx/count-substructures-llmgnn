Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. In this case, the sorted list of nodes based on their degree would be: 

Node 7 (Degree 1)  
Node 5 (Degree 1)  
Node 0 (Degree 4)  
Node 1 (Degree 4)  
Node 6 (Degree 4)  
Node 8 (Degree 3)  
Node 5 (Degree 2)  
Node 4 (Degree 5)  
Node 2 (Degree 5)  
Node 9 (Degree 6)  

Now, we will go through each edge in the order given and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
2. Edge (0, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 4> is formed.  
3. Edge (0, 5): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
4. Edge (0, 8): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
5. Edge (1, 0): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
6. Edge (1, 2): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
7. Edge (1, 4): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
8. Edge (1, 9): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
9. Edge (2, 0): Triangle <0, 2, 4> is already counted.  
10. Edge (2, 1): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
11. Edge (2, 3): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
12. Edge (2, 4): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
13. Edge (2, 9): Triangle <2, 4, 9> is formed.  
14. Edge (3, 2): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
15. Edge (3, 4): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
16. Edge (3, 6): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
17. Edge (3, 8): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
18. Edge (3, 9): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
19. Edge (4, 1): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
20. Edge (4, 2): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
21. Edge (4, 3): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
22. Edge (4, 8): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
23. Edge (4, 9): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
24. Edge (5, 0): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
25. Edge (6, 3): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
26. Edge (6, 7): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
27. Edge (6, 9): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
28. Edge (7, 6): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
29. Edge (8, 0): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
30. Edge (8, 3): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
31. Edge (8, 4): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
32. Edge (9, 1): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
33. Edge (9, 2): Triangle <2, 4, 9> is already counted.  
34. Edge (9, 3): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
35. Edge (9, 4): No triangles are formed with this edge.  
36. Edge (9, 6): No triangles are formed with this edge.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4> and <2, 4, 9>.
