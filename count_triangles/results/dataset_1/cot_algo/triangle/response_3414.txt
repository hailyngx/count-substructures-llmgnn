Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the nodes will be:
Nodes: 0 8 6 4 7 1 9 3 5 2

Now, we can analyze the edges starting from the ones with lower labeled vertices with fewer connections. 

Edge (0, 8):
Node 0 has no other edges. 

Edge (6, 2):
Node 6 has no other edges. 

Edge (4, 7):
Node 4 has edges with nodes 5 and 7.

Edge (7, 3):
Node 7 has an edge with node 8.

Edge (1, 2):
Node 1 has edges with nodes 3, 5, and 9.

Edge (9, 2):
Node 9 has no other edges.

Edge (3, 1):
Node 3 has an edge with node 7.

Edge (5, 4):
Node 5 has no other edges.

The triangles found in this graph are: 
<2, 1, 3>
<4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [2].
