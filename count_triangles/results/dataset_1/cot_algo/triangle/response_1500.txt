Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted order of vertices in this graph is:
0 - 1 connection
4 - 1 connection
9 - 2 connections
3 - 3 connections
2 - 4 connections
6 - 4 connections
5 - 6 connections
1 - 7 connections

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges in the order specified. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 2, 5>
3. <1, 3, 5>
4. <1, 4, 5>
5. <1, 5, 6>
6. <1, 5, 9>
7. <2, 3, 5>
8. <3, 5, 6>
9. <3, 6, 9>
10. <5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [10]
