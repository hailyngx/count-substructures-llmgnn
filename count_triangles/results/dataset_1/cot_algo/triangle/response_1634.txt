Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are: 
Node 0: degree 5 
Node 1: degree 5 
Node 2: degree 4 
Node 3: degree 4 
Node 5: degree 4 
Node 7: degree 3 
Node 6: degree 2 
Node 4: degree 1 
Node 9: degree 1 
Node 8: degree 1 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangles involving Node 6:
   - None

2. Triangles involving Node 8:
   - None

3. Triangles involving Node 9:
   - None

4. Triangles involving Node 4:
   - None

5. Triangles involving Node 2:
   - None

6. Triangles involving Node 7:
   - None

7. Triangles involving Node 0:
   - <0, 1, 3>

8. Triangles involving Node 5:
   - <0, 5, 9>

Adding up the triangles found, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3> and <0, 5, 9>.
