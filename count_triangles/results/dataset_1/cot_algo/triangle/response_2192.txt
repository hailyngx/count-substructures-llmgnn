Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Vertex 2 -> Label 0  
Vertex 1 -> Label 1  
Vertex 7 -> Label 2  
Vertex 9 -> Label 3  
Vertex 6 -> Label 4  
Vertex 3 -> Label 5  
Vertex 8 -> Label 6  
Vertex 5 -> Label 7  
Vertex 4 -> Label 8  
Vertex 0 -> Label 9  

Now, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 3) cannot form a triangle as both vertices have the same label.
- Edge (0, 4) can form a triangle with shared connection 5: <0, 4, 5>.
- Edge (0, 5) can form a triangle with shared connection 4: <0, 5, 4>.
- Edge (1, 5) cannot form a triangle as both vertices have the same label.
- Edge (2, 7) cannot form a triangle as both vertices have the same label.
- Edge (2, 8) can form a triangle with shared connection 4: <2, 8, 4>.
- Edge (3, 0) cannot form a triangle as both vertices have the same label.
- Edge (3, 9) cannot form a triangle as both vertices have the same label.
- Edge (4, 0) can form a triangle with shared connection 5: <4, 0, 5>.
- Edge (4, 5) can form a triangle with shared connection 0: <4, 5, 0>.
- Edge (4, 6) cannot form a triangle as vertex 6 has a higher label.
- Edge (4, 7) cannot form a triangle as vertex 7 has a higher label.
- Edge (4, 8) can form a triangle with shared connection 5: <4, 8, 5>.
- Edge (5, 0) can form a triangle with shared connection 4: <5, 0, 4>.
- Edge (5, 1) cannot form a triangle as vertex 1 has a higher label.
- Edge (5, 4) can form a triangle with shared connection 0: <5, 4, 0>.
- Edge (5, 6) cannot form a triangle as vertex 6 has a higher label.
- Edge (5, 8) can form a triangle with shared connection 4: <5, 8, 4>.
- Edge (6, 4) cannot form a triangle as both vertices have the same label.
- Edge (6, 5) cannot form a triangle as vertex 5 has a higher label.
- Edge (6, 8) can form a triangle with shared connection 4: <6, 8, 4>.
- Edge (7, 2) cannot form a triangle as both vertices have the same label.
- Edge (7, 4) cannot form a triangle as vertex 4 has a higher label.
- Edge (8, 2) can form a triangle with shared connection 4: <8, 2, 4>.
- Edge (8, 4) can form a triangle with shared connection 5: <8, 4, 5>.
- Edge (8, 5) can form a triangle with shared connection 4: <8, 5, 4>.
- Edge (8, 6) cannot form a triangle as vertex 6 has a higher label.
- Edge (9, 3) cannot form a triangle as both vertices have the same label.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 5>, <2, 8, 4>, <4, 0, 5>, <4, 5, 0>, <4, 8, 5>, <5, 0, 4>.
