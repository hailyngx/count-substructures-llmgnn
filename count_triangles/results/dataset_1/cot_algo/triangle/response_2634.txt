Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by the number of connections they have. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices, the new labels are: 
0: 3 connections
1: 7 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 6 connections
4: 5 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 5 connections
9: 4 connections

We will now go through the edges in the order specified and count the number of triangles. Remember to only check for triangles if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 8>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
