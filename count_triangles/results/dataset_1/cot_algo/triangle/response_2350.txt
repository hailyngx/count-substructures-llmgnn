Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 6 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 3 connections

Now, let's assign new labels to vertices based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 0 (2 connections) -> L1
- Vertex 1 (2 connections) -> L2
- Vertex 3 (2 connections) -> L3
- Vertex 4 (2 connections) -> L4
- Vertex 5 (2 connections) -> L5
- Vertex 8 (2 connections) -> L6
- Vertex 9 (3 connections) -> L7
- Vertex 6 (4 connections) -> L8
- Vertex 2 (4 connections) -> L9
- Vertex 7 (6 connections) -> L10

Next, we go through each edge in the sorted order of vertex labels to find triangles:
- Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 2) forms a triangle <2, 6, 7>.
- Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 2) forms a triangle <2, 6, 7>.
- Edge (7, 6) forms a triangle <2, 6, 7>.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <2, 6, 7>.
