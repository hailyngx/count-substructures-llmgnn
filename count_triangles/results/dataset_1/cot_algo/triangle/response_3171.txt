Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 4 has 0 connections
- Nodes 6 and 3 have 1 connection each
- Nodes 1, 8, and 0 have 3 connections each
- Nodes 9 and 7 have 4 connections each
- Node 2 has 5 connections
- Node 5 has 6 connections

Now, let's relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Node 4 -> Node 0
- Nodes 6 and 3 -> Node 1
- Nodes 1, 8, and 0 -> Node 2
- Nodes 9 and 7 -> Node 3
- Node 2 -> Node 4
- Node 5 -> Node 5

Next, let's examine the edges in the graph:
(0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7)
(1, 2) (1, 3)
(2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 3)
(3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5)
(5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7)
(6, 8)
(7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3)
(8, 5) (8, 6)
(9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
