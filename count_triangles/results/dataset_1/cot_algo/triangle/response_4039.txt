Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 4 has 0 connections.
Nodes 1 and 8 each have 1 connection.
Nodes 5 and 6 each have 2 connections.
Nodes 0, 2, 7, and 9 each have 3 connections.
Node 3 has 6 connections.

Now, we can count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. Starting from the edge with the lowest labeled vertex, which is (0, 2), we find that nodes 0 and 2 have a shared connection with node 3, forming a triangle <0, 2, 3>. 

Continuing with the edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
