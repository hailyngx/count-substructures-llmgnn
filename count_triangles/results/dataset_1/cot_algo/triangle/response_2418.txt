Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following relabeling:

Node 0 has 1 connection.
Node 4 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 6 connections.
Node 8 has 6 connections.

Following the degree-based ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 7. Triangle <0, 7, 2>.
2. Edge (1, 2): Forms a triangle with shared connection 2. Triangle <1, 2, 3>.
3. Edge (1, 8): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 9): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (2, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 7. Triangle <0, 7, 2>.
6. Edge (3, 2): Forms a triangle with shared connection 2. Triangle <1, 2, 3>.
7. Edge (3, 4): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (3, 5): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (4, 3): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (5, 3): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (6, 8): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (7, 0): Forms a triangle with shared connection 7. Triangle <0, 7, 2>.
14. Edge (7, 2): Forms a triangle with shared connection 2. Triangle <1, 2, 7>.
15. Edge (7, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection 8. Triangle <1, 8, 7>.
16. Edge (8, 1): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1. Triangle <1, 8, 7>.
17. Edge (8, 2): Forms a triangle with shared connection 2. Triangle <1, 2, 3>.
18. Edge (8, 3): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3. Triangle <1, 2, 3>.
19. Edge (8, 6): Forms a triangle with shared connection 6. Triangle <6, 8, 7>.
20. Edge (8, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 7. Triangle <0, 7, 2>.
21. Edge (9, 1): No triangle formed.
22. Edge (9, 2): No triangle formed.
23. Edge (9, 6): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
