Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows: 
Nodes: 1(1), 4(1), 6(1), 7(2), 8(3), 5(4), 3(5), 9(6), 2(8), 0(9)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles: 
1. Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
2. Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (6, 0): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (8, 7): Triangle formed with node 2: <2, 7, 8>
6. Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (3, 5): Triangle formed with node 0: <0, 3, 5>
8. Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.

[Total number of triangles: 2]
