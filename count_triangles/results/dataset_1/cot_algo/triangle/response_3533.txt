Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling: 

Nodes: 3, 7, 1, 2, 6, 9, 5, 0, 4, 8

Now, let's examine each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Considering (0, 4): 
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 5, 6, and 8. 
- Node 4 has connections with nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 
- Therefore, the shared connections <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, and <0, 4, 8> form triangles. 

Considering (0, 5): 
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 4, 6, and 8. 
- Node 5 has connections with nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9. 
- Therefore, the shared connections <0, 5, 4> and <0, 5, 8> form triangles. 

Considering (0, 6): 
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 4, 5, and 8. 
- Node 6 has connections with nodes 2, 4, and 5. 
- Therefore, the shared connections <0, 6, 4> and <0, 6, 5> form triangles. 

Considering (0, 8): 
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 4, 5, and 6. 
- Node 8 has connections with nodes 3, 4, and 5. 
- Therefore, the shared connections <0, 8, 4> and <0, 8, 5> form triangles. 

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [12]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 8, 5>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 8, 0>.
