Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Vertices: 7 < 2 < 0 < 3 < 8 < 1 < 2 < 6 < 4 < 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Edge: (7, 8)
2. Edge: (7, 9)
3. Edge: (2, 6)
4. Edge: (0, 9)
5. Edge: (3, 1)
6. Edge: (3, 4)
7. Edge: (3, 5)
8. Edge: (4, 1)
9. Edge: (4, 3)
10. Edge: (4, 5)
11. Edge: (4, 6)
12. Edge: (5, 0)
13. Edge: (5, 3)
14. Edge: (5, 4)
15. Edge: (5, 6)
16. Edge: (5, 8)
17. Edge: (6, 1)
18. Edge: (6, 2)
19. Edge: (6, 4)
20. Edge: (6, 5)
21. Edge: (6, 9)
22. Edge: (9, 0)
23. Edge: (9, 6)
24. Edge: (9, 7)
25. Edge: (9, 8)

There are [25] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 1, 4>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 9>
<9, 7, 8>
