Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 3 (degree 2)  
Node 2 (degree 2)  
Node 7 (degree 2)  
Node 5 (degree 3)  
Node 6 (degree 3)  
Node 4 (degree 4)  
Node 8 (degree 4)  
Node 9 (degree 4)  
Node 1 (degree 5)  
Node 0 (degree 6)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

Triangles:
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
