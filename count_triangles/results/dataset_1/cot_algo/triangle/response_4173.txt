Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices with their connections:
1. 7 connections: 1
2. 6 connections: 3, 8
3. 5 connections: 2, 9
4. 4 connections: 0
5. 3 connections: 5
6. 2 connections: 4, 6

Now we will count the triangles:
