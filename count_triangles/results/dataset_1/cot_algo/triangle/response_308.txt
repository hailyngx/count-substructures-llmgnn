Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method begins by sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 1 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 0
Vertex 7 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 1
Vertex 2 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 2
Vertex 8 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 3
Vertex 9 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 4
Vertex 0 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 5
Vertex 4 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 6
Vertex 5 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 7
Vertex 3 (degree 6) becomes Vertex 8
Vertex 6 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 9

Now, looking at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Calculating total triangles:
We find that there are 12 triangles in the graph.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 8>.
