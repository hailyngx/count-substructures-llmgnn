Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

- Vertex 5 has 0 connections
- Vertices 2 has 0 connections
- Vertices 4 has 1 connection
- Vertices 7 has 1 connection
- Vertices 3 has 1 connection
- Vertices 1 has 2 connections
- Vertices 9 has 2 connections
- Vertices 6 has 2 connections
- Vertices 8 has 2 connections
- Vertices 0 has 3 connections

Now we need to relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Vertex 5 -> 0
- Vertex 2 -> 1
- Vertex 4 -> 2
- Vertex 7 -> 3
- Vertex 3 -> 4
- Vertex 1 -> 5
- Vertex 9 -> 6
- Vertex 6 -> 7
- Vertex 8 -> 8
- Vertex 0 -> 9

Now, let's list the edges with the lower labeled vertex first:

(2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by checking the shared connections:

- Triangles <0, 2, 9>
- Triangles <1, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
