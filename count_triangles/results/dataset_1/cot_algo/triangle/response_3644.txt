Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we consider the edges based on the vertices with lower labels having fewer connections. 

By examining the shared connections between the vertices connected by the edges, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 1>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 1>
<4, 5, 2>
<6, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
