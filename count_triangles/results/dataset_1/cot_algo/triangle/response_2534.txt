Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, we get the following new labels for the vertices:

Node 1: 7 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 0: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

1. Node 2 connects with Node 7. No further triangles.

2. Node 6 connects with Node 0, Node 4, and Node 9. No triangles due to the ordering.

3. Node 0 connects with Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 8. One triangle <0, 4, 8>.

4. Node 7 connects with Node 2. No further triangles.

5. Node 1 connects with Node 3 and Node 8. No triangles due to the ordering.

6. Node 3 connects with Node 1, Node 8, and Node 9. One triangle <1, 3, 8>.

7. Node 8 connects with Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 9. Two triangles <0, 4, 8> and <1, 3, 8>.

8. Node 9 connects with Node 3, Node 4, and Node 6. One triangle <1, 3, 9>.

The total number of triangles is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, and <1, 3, 9>.
