Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertex 1: 0 connections - 1
Vertex 0: 1 connection - 9
Vertex 2: 1 connection - 4, 5
Vertex 3: 2 connections - 3, 6, 8
Vertex 4: 3 connections - 7
Vertex 5: 5 connections - 9

Now, let's analyze the edges following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

(0, 9) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

(3, 6) - Proceed
Shared connections: 9

(3, 8) - Proceed
Shared connections: 9

(4, 5) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

(5, 7) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

(5, 9) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

(6, 9) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

(7, 8) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

(8, 9) - Proceed
Shared connections: None
