Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to rearrange the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree (from lowest to highest):
0 (degree: 1)
5 (degree: 1)
6 (degree: 1)
8 (degree: 2)
6 (degree: 1)
3 (degree: 2)
7 (degree: 3)
1 (degree: 4)
4 (degree: 4)
9 (degree: 5)

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
0 → 0
5 → 1
6 → 2
8 → 3
6 → 4
3 → 5
7 → 6
1 → 7
4 → 8
9 → 9

Now, we will list the triangles:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
