Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 1 (0) has degree 4
Vertex 2 (2) has degree 2
Vertex 3 (3) has degree 4
Vertex 4 (4) has degree 1
Vertex 5 (5) has degree 4
Vertex 6 (7) has degree 3
Vertex 7 (8) has degree 1
Vertex 8 (9) has degree 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices in increasing order of their degrees:

Vertex 0 (4)
Vertex 1 (7)
Vertex 2 (2)
Vertex 3 (8)
Vertex 4 (1)
Vertex 5 (6)
Vertex 6 (0)
Vertex 7 (5)

Next, we will count the triangles by examining each edge:

- Edge (0, 2): Check vertex 4 (0) and vertex 2 (2), share a connection with vertex 1 (7) forming a triangle. (0, 2, 7)
- Edge (0, 3): Check vertex 4 (0) and vertex 3 (8), share a connection with vertex 1 (7) forming a triangle. (0, 3, 7)
- Edge (0, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 9): Check vertex 4 (0) and vertex 8 (9), share a connection with vertex 1 (7) forming a triangle. (0, 9, 7)
- Edge (2, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9): Check vertex 2 (2) and vertex 8 (9), share a connection with vertex 1 (7) forming a triangle. (2, 9, 7)
- Edge (3, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 5): Check vertex 3 (8) and vertex 5 (6), share a connection with vertex 1 (7) forming a triangle. (3, 5, 7)
- Edge (3, 7): Check vertex 3 (8) and vertex 6 (7), share a connection with vertex 5 (6) forming a triangle. (3, 7, 5)
- Edge (3, 9): Check vertex 3 (8) and vertex 8 (9), share a connection with vertex 1 (7) forming a triangle. (3, 9, 7)
- Edge (4, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 7): Check vertex 5 (6) and vertex 6 (7), share a connection with vertex 3 (8) forming a triangle. (5, 7, 3)
- Edge (5, 8): Check vertex 5 (6) and vertex 7 (5), share a connection with vertex 3 (8) forming a triangle. (5, 8, 3)
- Edge (5, 9): Check vertex 5 (6) and vertex 8 (9), share a connection with vertex 1 (7) forming a triangle. (5, 9, 7)
- Edge (7, 3): Check vertex 6 (7) and vertex 3 (8), share a connection with vertex 5 (6) forming a triangle. (7, 3, 5)
- Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 5) does not form a triangle.
