Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order:

Vertices:  
0 - 1 connection  
1 - 2 connections  
8 - 1 connection  
3 - 2 connections  
2 - 2 connections  
6 - 3 connections  
9 - 4 connections  
4 - 5 connections  
7 - 4 connections  
5 - 4 connections  

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:   
<1, 5, 7>  
<1, 7, 9>  
<2, 4, 6>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 7, 9>
