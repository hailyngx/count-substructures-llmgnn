Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
```
Node 2: degree 1
Node 5: degree 1
Node 9: degree 2
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6
```

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 1) and Edge (1, 0) forms the triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- Edge (0, 3) and Edge (3, 0) forms the triangle <0, 3, 1>.
- Edge (0, 4) and Edge (4, 0) forms the triangle <0, 4, 1>.
- Edge (0, 6) does not form a triangle as vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 6.
- Edge (0, 8) and Edge (8, 0) forms the triangle <0, 8, 4>.
- Edge (1, 3) and Edge (3, 1) forms the triangle <1, 3, 0>.
- Edge (1, 4) and Edge (4, 1) forms the triangle <1, 4, 0>.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle as vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 6.
- Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle as vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 7.
- Edge (3, 5) does not form a triangle as vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 5.
- Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle as vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 7.
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle as vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 8.
- Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 2.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 5.
- Edge (4, 8) and Edge (8, 4) forms the triangle <4, 8, 0>.
- Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 9.
- Edge (5, 3) does not form a triangle as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 3.
- Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle as vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 7.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle as vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 4, and the triangles found are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 4, 1>
- <0, 8, 4>
- <4, 8, 0>

The final output is: [4]
