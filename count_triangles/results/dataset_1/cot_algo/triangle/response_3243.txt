Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

0: 3 connections
1: 1 connection
2: 5 connections
3: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 4 connections

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method and proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(0, 2): forms a triangle with 5
(0, 5): forms a triangle with 2
(0, 9): forms a triangle with 4
(1, 3): no triangle formed
(2, 4): forms a triangle with 5
(2, 6): no triangle formed
(2, 7): forms a triangle with 5
(3, 4): no triangle formed
(3, 7): forms a triangle with 5
(4, 8): no triangle formed
(4, 9): forms a triangle with 0
(5, 6): no triangle formed
(5, 7): forms a triangle with 2

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
