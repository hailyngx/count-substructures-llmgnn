Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, we get the following relabeling:
Vertices: 0, 4, 9, 5, 7, 8, 6, 1, 2, 3

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find:
- Triangle <1, 2, 3>
- Triangle <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle <3, 5, 7>
- Triangle <3, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is equal to [11].
