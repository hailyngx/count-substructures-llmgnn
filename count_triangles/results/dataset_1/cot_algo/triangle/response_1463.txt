Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of vertices sorted by their number of connections (degrees):

0: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
3: 3 connections
5: 6 connections
8: 6 connections
9: 6 connections
2: 7 connections

Since all vertices have different degrees, we'll proceed with checking triangles based on the degree-based ordering.

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 2): Triangle formed with vertex 0
- Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 1): Triangle already counted with (1, 2).
- Edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 5): Triangle formed with vertex 0.
- Edge (4, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 8): Triangle formed with vertex 0.
- Edge (5, 9): Triangle formed with vertices 6 and 7.
- Edge (6, 9): Triangle formed with vertex 7.
- Edge (7, 2): Triangle already counted with (2, 1).
- Edge (7, 9): Triangle formed with vertex 8.
- Edge (8, 2): Triangle already counted with (1, 2).
- Edge (8, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 5): Triangle already counted with (5, 0).
- Edge (8, 9): Triangle already counted with (7, 9).
- Edge (9, 5): Triangle already counted with (5, 0).
- Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 7): Triangle already counted with (7, 9).
- Edge (9, 8): Triangle already counted with (7, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9] and the unique triangles are as follows: 
<1, 0, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
