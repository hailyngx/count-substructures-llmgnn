Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are as follows:
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 9: 3 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Calculating the number of triangles:
1. For edge (0, 2):
   Node 0 and Node 2 share Node 3. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.

2. For edge (0, 3):
   Node 0 and Node 3 share Node 4. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>.

3. For edge (0, 4):
   No triangles are formed.

4. For edge (0, 9):
   Node 0 and Node 9 share Node 7. Triangle formed: <0, 9, 7>.

5. For edge (1, 2):
   No triangles are formed.

6. For edge (1, 6):
   Node 1 and Node 6 share Node 3. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 3>.

7. For edge (1, 7):
   Node 1 and Node 7 share Node 5. Triangle formed: <1, 7, 5>.

8. For edge (2, 1):
   No triangles are formed.

9. For edge (2, 5):
   Node 2 and Node 5 share Node 6. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 6>.

10. For edge (3, 0):
    No triangles are formed.

11. For edge (3, 4):
    Node 3 and Node 4 share Node 0. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 0>.

12. For edge (3, 6):
    Node 3 and Node 6 share Node 1. Triangle formed: <3, 6, 1>.

13. For edge (3, 7):
    Node 3 and Node 7 share Node 1. Triangle formed: <3, 7, 1>.

14. For edge (4, 0):
    No triangles are formed.

15. For edge (4, 3):
    Node 4 and Node 3 share Node 0. Triangle formed: <4, 3, 0>.

16. For edge (5, 2):
    No triangles are formed.

17. For edge (5, 6):
    Node 5 and Node 6 share Node 1. Triangle formed: <5, 6, 1>.

18. For edge (5, 7):
    Node 5 and Node 7 share Node 3. Triangle formed: <5, 7, 3>.

19. For edge (6, 1):
    No triangles are formed.

20. For edge (6, 3):
    No triangles are formed.

21. For edge (6, 5):
    Node 6 and Node 5 share Node 1. Triangle formed: <6, 5, 1>.

22. For edge (6, 8):
    No triangles are formed.

23. For edge (7, 1):
    No triangles are formed.

24. For edge (7, 3):
    No triangles are formed.

25. For edge (7, 5):
    No triangles are formed.

26. For edge (7, 9):
    Node 7 and Node 9 share Node 0. Triangle formed: <7, 9, 0>.

27. For edge (8, 6):
    No triangles are formed.

28. For edge (9, 0):
    No triangles are formed.

29. For edge (9, 7):
    Node 9 and Node 7 share Node 0. Triangle formed: <9, 7, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
