Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new vertex order is: 

Vertex 2 (degree 1)
Vertex 4 (degree 1)
Vertex 6 (degree 1)
Vertex 9 (degree 2)
Vertex 5 (degree 4)
Vertex 1 (degree 4)
Vertex 3 (degree 4)
Vertex 0 (degree 6)
Vertex 7 (degree 6)
Vertex 8 (degree 6)

Now, we will analyze the edges in this new order:
(2, 3) - No triangles can be formed.
(4, 7) - No triangles can be formed.
(6, 0) - No triangles can be formed.
(9, 1) - No triangles can be formed.
(5, 7) - Triangle formed: <5, 0, 7>.
(1, 7) - Triangle formed: <1, 0, 7>.
(3, 8) - No triangles can be formed.
(0, 5) - Triangle formed: <0, 7, 5>.
(7, 5) - Triangle formed: <7, 0, 5>.
(8, 7) - Triangle formed: <8, 0, 7>.

Total number of triangles: [4]
