Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. 

Here are the vertices with their respective number of connections:
- Vertex 3: 0 connections
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 6 connections

Now, we will examine each edge according to the method stated earlier:

Edge (0, 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 1. 
Edge (0, 8): No additional triangles. 
Edge (1, 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 9.
Edge (1, 9): No additional triangles. 
Edge (2, 7): No additional triangles. 
Edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle with vertex 7. 
Edge (4, 7): No additional triangles. 
Edge (5, 6): No additional triangles. 
Edge (6, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 7. 
Edge (6, 5): No additional triangles. 
Edge (6, 9): Forms a triangle with vertex 1. 
Edge (7, 0): No additional triangles. 
Edge (7, 1): No additional triangles. 
Edge (7, 2): No additional triangles. 
Edge (7, 4): No additional triangles. 
Edge (8, 0): No additional triangles. 
Edge (9, 1): No additional triangles. 
Edge (9, 6): Forms a triangle with vertex 1. 

Thus, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, and <4, 6, 7>.
