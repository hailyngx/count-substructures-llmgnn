Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted list is as follows: 

Vertices: 3, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 0, 8, 6, 1

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the method described earlier.

Calculating the triangles: 
- For edge (3, 1): No triangles can be formed since both vertices have only one connection.
- For edge (4, 1): No triangles can be formed for the same reason.
- For edge (7, 6): No triangles can be formed as well.

Now, let's calculate the triangles for the rest of the edges:

- For edge (9, 5): No triangles can be formed since both vertices have only two connections.
- For edge (2, 6): No triangles can be formed for the same reason.
- For edge (5, 8): A triangle <5, 8, 9> is formed.
- For edge (5, 9): No triangles can be formed since both vertices have only three connections.
- For edge (2, 8): No triangles can be formed as well.
- For edge (5, 6): No triangles can be formed for the same reason.

Now, let's summarize the triangles found:
- Total number of triangles: [1]
- Unique triangles found: <5, 8, 9>
