Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly.

Sorted vertices by degree:
Node 3: (Degree 1)  
Node 1: (Degree 1)  
Node 2: (Degree 1)  
Node 7: (Degree 2)  
Node 4: (Degree 3)  
Node 5: (Degree 4)  
Node 8: (Degree 4)  
Node 9: (Degree 4)  
Node 6: (Degree 5)  
Node 0: (Degree 6)  

Next, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles. We will only consider an edge if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Based on the information provided, we have the following triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
