Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Nodes: 7, 6, 0, 5, 4, 2, 1, 8, 9, 3

Using this ordering, we can iterate through the edges and count the number of triangles formed:
1. Edge (0, 3):
   - Both nodes 0 and 3 have connections with node 9, forming triangle <0, 3, 9>.
2. Edge (0, 9):
   - No triangles are formed.
3. Edge (1, 2):
   - No triangles are formed.
4. Edge (1, 3):
   - No triangles are formed as node 3 has a connection with node 5, not with node 1.
5. Edge (1, 4):
   - No triangles are formed as node 4 has connections with nodes 8 and 9, not with node 1.
6. Edge (1, 6):
   - No triangles are formed.
7. Edge (1, 8):
   - No triangles are formed.
8. Edge (2, 1):
   - No triangles are formed.
9. Edge (2, 3):
   - No triangles are formed as node 3 has a connection with node 5, not with node 2.
10. Edge (2, 8):
    - No triangles are formed.
11. Edge (3, 0):
    - No triangles are formed.
12. Edge (3, 1):
    - No triangles are formed.
13. Edge (3, 2):
    - No triangles are formed as node 3 has a connection with node 5, not with node 2.
14. Edge (3, 5):
    - From nodes 3, 5, we already have the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
15. Edge (4, 1):
    - No triangles are formed as node 4 has connections with nodes 8 and 9, not with node 1.
16. Edge (4, 8):
    - No triangles are formed.
17. Edge (4, 9):
    - No triangles are formed.
18. Edge (5, 3):
    - From nodes 3, 5, we already have the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
19. Edge (5, 9):
    - No triangles are formed.
20. Edge (6, 1):
    - No triangles are formed.
21. Edge (6, 7):
    - No triangles are formed.
22. Edge (7, 6):
    - No triangles are formed.
23. Edge (8, 1):
    - No triangles are formed.
24. Edge (8, 2):
    - No triangles are formed.
25. Edge (8, 4):
    - No triangles are formed.
26. Edge (8, 9):
    - No triangles are formed.
27. Edge (9, 0):
    - No triangles are formed.
28. Edge (9, 4):
    - No triangles are formed.
29. Edge (9, 5):
    - No triangles are formed.
30. Edge (9, 8):
    - No triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] and the unique triangle is <0, 3, 9>.
