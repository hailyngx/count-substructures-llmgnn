Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following relabeling:
- Node 2 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5 have 2 connections.
- Nodes 8 and 9 have 3 connections.
- Nodes 6 and 7 have 4 connections.
- Node 3 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can analyze the edges to count the triangles. We proceed for each edge in the order provided:

1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 and Node 1 have 2 shared connections (Node 3 and Node 7), forming triangle <0, 1, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 3): Node 0 and Node 3 have 2 shared connections (Node 1 and Node 7), forming triangle <0, 3, 1>.
3. Edge (1, 3): Node 1 and Node 3 have 2 shared connections (Node 0 and Node 7), forming triangle <1, 3, 0>.
4. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 and Node 6 have 1 shared connection (Node 7), forming triangle <3, 6, 7>.
5. Edge (3, 7): Node 3 and Node 7 have 2 shared connections (Node 6 and Node 9), forming triangle <3, 7, 6>.
6. Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (5, 7): Node 5 and Node 7 have 1 shared connection (Node 4), forming triangle <5, 7, 4>.
8. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 and Node 7 have 2 shared connections (Node 3 and Node 9), forming triangle <6, 7, 3>.
9. Edge (6, 8): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (6, 9): Node 6 and Node 9 have 2 shared connections (Node 7 and Node 8), forming triangle <6, 9, 7>.
11. Edge (7, 9): Node 7 and Node 9 have 2 shared connections (Node 6 and Node 8), forming triangle <7, 9, 6>.
12. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 and Node 9 have 1 shared connection (Node 6), forming triangle <8, 9, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
Here are the unique triangles found: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 1>, <1, 3, 0>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 6>, <5, 7, 4>, <6, 9, 7>.
