Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 6 - degree: 1
Node 5 - degree: 2
Node 9 - degree: 2
Node 1 - degree: 2
Node 0 - degree: 2
Node 3 - degree: 3
Node 8 - degree: 3
Node 4 - degree: 4
Node 7 - degree: 5
Node 2 - degree: 5

Based on the degree-based ordering, the edges that meet the criteria are: (1,5), (1,4), (0,9), and (0,8).

Calculating the triangles:
- For edge (1,5): Node 1 and Node 5 have Node 4 in common. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 4>.
- For edge (1,4): Node 1 and Node 4 do not form a triangle with any other edge based on the ordering.
- For edge (0,9): Node 0 and Node 9 do not form a triangle with any other edge based on the ordering.
- For edge (0,8): Node 0 and Node 8 have Node 4 in common. Triangle formed: <0, 8, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].

The unique triangles found are: <1, 5, 4> and <0, 8, 4>.
