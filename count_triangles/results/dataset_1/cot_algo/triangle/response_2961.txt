Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we can list the degrees of each node:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 0 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we sort the nodes by their degrees:
Node 2 (0 connections)
Node 6 (1 connection)
Node 0, 5, 7, 9 (2 connections)
Node 1, 3 (3 connections)
Node 8 (4 connections)
Node 4 (5 connections)

Next, we will count the triangles. Since we have sorted the nodes by degrees, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Counting triangles:
- Triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle <3, 4, 5>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
