Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0: 2 edges
Node 1: 2 edges
Node 2: 2 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 7: 2 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 9: 2 edges

Next, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Node 0 (2 edges) becomes Node 0
Node 1 (2 edges) becomes Node 1
Node 2 (2 edges) becomes Node 2
Node 3 (3 edges) becomes Node 3
Node 4 (4 edges) becomes Node 4
Node 5 (3 edges) becomes Node 5
Node 6 (4 edges) becomes Node 6
Node 7 (2 edges) becomes Node 7
Node 8 (4 edges) becomes Node 8
Node 9 (2 edges) becomes Node 9

Now, we will consider each edge and count the number of triangles:

For edge (0, 3):
Node 0 shares connections with Node 7.
Node 3 shares connections with Node 4 and Node 5.
Therefore, we have a triangle <0, 3, 4>.

For edge (1, 6):
Node 1 shares connection with Node 8.
Node 6 shares connections with Node 2 and Node 5.
Therefore, we have a triangle <1, 6, 5>.

For edge (2, 4):
Node 2 shares connections with Node 6.
Node 4 shares connections with Node 3, Node 5, and Node 9.
Therefore, we have three triangles: <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 9>.

For edge (3, 4):
This edge does not form any additional triangles.

For edge (3, 5):
Node 3 shares connections with Node 4.
Node 5 shares connections with Node 6.
Therefore, we have a triangle <3, 5, 6>.

For edge (6, 1):
This edge does not form any additional triangles.

For edge (6, 2):
Node 6 shares connections with Node 5.
Node 2 shares connections with Node 4.
Therefore, we have a triangle <6, 2, 4>.

For edge (6, 5):
This edge does not form any additional triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
