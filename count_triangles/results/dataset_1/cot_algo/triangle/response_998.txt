Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first sort the vertices by their degrees:

0: degree 4
1: degree 2
2: degree 4
3: degree 5
5: degree 3
6: degree 2
7: degree 5
9: degree 1

Next, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

0: 7
1: 6
2: 5
3: 8
5: 4
6: 2
7: 9
9: 1

Now, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles:

Triangle <0, 2, 7>
Triangle <0, 2, 3>
Triangle <0, 5, 7>
Triangle <0, 5, 2>
Triangle <0, 5, 3>

Total number of triangles: [5]
