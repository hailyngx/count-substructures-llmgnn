Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 1
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4

Nodes sorted by degree:
1. Node 1
2. Node 3
3. Node 7
4. Node 0
5. Node 5
6. Node 6
7. Node 8
8. Node 9
9. Node 2

Checking each edge with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 5, 7>
- Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 5, 8>
- Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <2, 5, 8>
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <0, 5, 6>
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 6>
