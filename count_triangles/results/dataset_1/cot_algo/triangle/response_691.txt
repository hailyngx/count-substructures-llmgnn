Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 4 (degree 0)
Node 9 (degree 0)
Node 5 (degree 1)
Node 6 (degree 1)
Node 0 (degree 2)
Node 2 (degree 2)
Node 1 (degree 3)
Node 8 (degree 3)
Node 3 (degree 6)
Node 7 (degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

Triangles:
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 3, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
