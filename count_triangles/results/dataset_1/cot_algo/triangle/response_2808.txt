Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly:

Node 3 has 1 connection.
Node 0 and Node 7 have 0 connections.
Node 4 and Node 6 have 2 connections.
Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, and Node 9 have 3 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.

Given the edges provided, we look at each edge in order of the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections. We will count the number of triangles formed using the shared connections. 

Calculating the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find that there are:  
\[ [10] \]

Below are the unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 8>
