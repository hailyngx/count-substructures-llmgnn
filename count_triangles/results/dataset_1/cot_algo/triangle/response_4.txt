Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes and their corresponding degrees:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 2

Next, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5

Now, we will go through each edge starting from the edge with the lower labeled vertex to count the triangles:
1. Edge (1, 4) cannot form a triangle.
2. Edge (2, 3) cannot form a triangle.
3. Edge (0, 3) can form a triangle: <0, 3, 7>.
4. Edge (5, 6) cannot form a triangle.
5. Edge (0, 6) can form a triangle: <0, 6, 7>.
6. Edge (0, 7) can form a triangle: <0, 3, 7>.
7. Edge (5, 7) cannot form a triangle.
8. Edge (6, 7) can form a triangle: <0, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] inside brackets.
