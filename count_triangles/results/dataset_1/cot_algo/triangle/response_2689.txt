Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degrees of the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0: degree = 3
Vertex 1: degree = 3
Vertex 2: degree = 2
Vertex 3: degree = 3
Vertex 4: degree = 6
Vertex 5: degree = 6
Vertex 6: degree = 4
Vertex 7: degree = 2
Vertex 8: degree = 3
Vertex 9: degree = 6

Sorting the vertices by degree, we get the following order:
Vertex 2
Vertex 7
Vertex 0
Vertex 1
Vertex 3
Vertex 8
Vertex 6
Vertex 4
Vertex 9
Vertex 5

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

Examining the edges in the order specified:

1. Edge (1, 3): Both vertices have 3 connections. No triangle formed.
2. Edge (2, 5): Vertex 2 has fewer connections, but no shared connection with Vertex 5. No triangle formed.
3. Edge (4, 8): Vertex 4 has more connections. No triangle formed.
4. Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 has fewer connections and shares Vertex 9 with Edge (3, 9). Triangle <3, 4, 9> formed.
5. Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 has fewer connections and shares Vertices 4 and 9 with other edges. Triangles <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 3> formed.
6. Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 has fewer connections, but no shared connection with Vertex 6. No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 8): Vertex 2 has fewer connections, but no shared connection with Vertex 8. No triangle formed.
8. Edge (5, 6): Vertex 5 has more connections. No triangle formed.
9. Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has fewer connections, but no shared connection with Vertex 7. No triangle formed.
10. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has more connections. No triangle formed.
11. Edge (8, 8): Both vertices are the same, and it is not considered an edge. No triangle formed.
12. Edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 has fewer connections and shares Vertex 9 with Edge (6, 9). Triangle <6, 8, 9> formed.
13. Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 has more connections. No triangle formed.
14. Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 has fewer connections and shares Vertex 5 with Edge (5, 2). Triangle <1, 5, 2> formed.
15. Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 has fewer connections and shares Vertex 9 with Edge (3, 4). Triangle <3, 9, 4> formed.
16. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has fewer connections, but no shared connection with Vertex 9. No triangle formed.

Count of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 3>, <6, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 2>, <3, 9, 4>
