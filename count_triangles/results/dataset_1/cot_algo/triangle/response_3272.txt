Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then relabeling them accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices, the new labels are:
Vertex 0 => Degree 3,
Vertex 1 => Degree 1,
Vertex 2 => Degree 2,
Vertex 3 => Degree 2,
Vertex 4 => Degree 2,
Vertex 5 => Degree 1,
Vertex 6 => Degree 6,
Vertex 7 => Degree 2,
Vertex 8 => Degree 4,
Vertex 9 => Degree 2.

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 and Vertex 6 have 3 shared neighbors: (7, 9, 2).
2. Edge (0, 7): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (0, 9): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 and Vertex 6 have 1 shared neighbor: (0).
6. Edge (2, 9): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 and Vertex 6 have 1 shared neighbor: (8).
8. Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 and Vertex 6 have 1 shared neighbor: (8).
10. Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, and <4, 6, 8>.
