Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 6
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we can count the triangles formed:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <0, 7, 8>
5. <0, 9, 6>
6. <0, 9, 8>
7. <3, 5, 4>
8. <5, 2, 4>
9. <5, 8, 9>
10. <5, 8, 7>
11. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in total. 
So, the output is: [11]
