Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we obtain the following relabeling: 
Node 2 has 0 connections.  
Nodes 5, 7 have 1 connection.  
Nodes 1, 4 have 2 connections.  
Nodes 3, 9 have 3 connections.  
Nodes 0, 8 have 5 connections.  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. 

Triangles:
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 9, 4>
<3, 8, 1>
<3, 8, 0>
<3, 8, 9>
<3, 9, 4>
<8, 9, 4>

Total number of triangles: [7]
