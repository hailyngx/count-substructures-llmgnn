Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections).

Node 7 has no connections.
Nodes 3 and 7 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 1, 5, and 9 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 4, 6, and 8 have 5 connections each.
Node 2 has 6 connections.
Node 0 has 7 connections.

We will start analyzing the edges in the graph based on the degree-based ordering method.

1. Edge (2, 9):
    - Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6.
    - Node 9 has connections with nodes 0, 6.
    - Triangle found: <0, 2, 9>.

2. Edge (6, 9):
    - Node 6 has connections with nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.
    - Node 9 has connections with nodes 0, 2, and 6.
    - Triangles found: <2, 6, 9>.
    
3. Edge (2, 6):
    - Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6.
    - Node 6 has connections with nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.
    - Triangle found: <2, 4, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
