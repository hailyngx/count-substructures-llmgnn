Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices in order: 8, 3, 5, 6, 2, 1, 9, 7, 0, 4

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 6>
