Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3): Both nodes 0 and 3 have 2 connections each. No triangles formed.
2. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 has 2 connections and Node 9 has 5 connections. No triangle formed.
3. Edge (1, 7): Both nodes have 2 connections each. No triangles formed.
4. Edge (1, 8): Both nodes have 2 connections each. No triangles formed.
5. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 4 has 3 connections. Shared connection with Node 7. Triangle <2, 4, 7> formed.
6. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 6 has 2 connections. No triangles formed.
7. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 7 has 3 connections. Shared connection with Node 4. Triangle <2, 4, 7> formed (already counted).
8. Edge (3, 0): Both nodes have 2 connections each. No triangles formed.
9. Edge (3, 9): Both nodes have 4 connections each. No triangles formed.
10. Edge (4, 2): Node 4 has 3 connections and Node 2 has 4 connections. Shared connection with Node 7. Triangle <2, 4, 7> formed (already counted).
11. Edge (4, 7): Node 4 has 3 connections and Node 7 has 3 connections. Shared connection with Node 2. Triangle <2, 4, 7> formed (already counted).
12. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 has 3 connections and Node 8 has 4 connections. No triangles formed.
13. Edge (6, 2): Both nodes have 2 connections each. No triangles formed.
14. Edge (7, 1): Both nodes have 2 connections each. No triangles formed.
15. Edge (7, 2): Node 7 has 3 connections and Node 2 has 4 connections. Shared connection with Node 4. Triangle <2, 4, 7> formed (already counted).
16. Edge (7, 4): Node 7 has 3 connections and Node 4 has 3 connections. Shared connection with Node 2. Triangle <2, 4, 7> formed (already counted).
17. Edge (8, 1): Both nodes have 2 connections each. No triangles formed.
18. Edge (8, 4): Node 8 has 4 connections and Node 4 has 3 connections. Shared connection with Node 7. Triangle <2, 4, 7> formed (already counted).
19. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 has 4 connections and Node 9 has 5 connections. No triangles formed.
20. Edge (9, 0): Both nodes have 2 connections each. No triangles formed.
21. Edge (9, 3): Both nodes have 4 connections each. No triangles formed.
22. Edge (9, 8): Node 9 has 5 connections and Node 8 has 4 connections. No triangles formed.
