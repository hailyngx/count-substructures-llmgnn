Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we can determine the degree of each vertex: 
- Node 0: 1 connection 
- Node 1: 5 connections 
- Node 2: 1 connection 
- Node 3: 2 connections 
- Node 4: 2 connections 
- Node 5: 1 connection 
- Node 6: 3 connections 
- Node 7: 4 connections 
- Node 8: 3 connections 
- Node 9: 5 connections 

Now, we'll reorder the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connected:
- Node 0 -> Degree 1
- Node 2 -> Degree 1
- Node 5 -> Degree 1
- Node 3 -> Degree 2
- Node 4 -> Degree 2
- Node 6 -> Degree 3
- Node 8 -> Degree 3
- Node 7 -> Degree 4
- Node 1 -> Degree 5
- Node 9 -> Degree 5

Next, we'll analyze the edges in ascending order of the node labels:
1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 (Degree 1) < Node 1 (Degree 5)
2. Edge (1, 3): Node 1 (Degree 5) > Node 3 (Degree 2)
3. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 (Degree 5) > Node 6 (Degree 3)
4. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 (Degree 5) = Node 9 (Degree 5)
5. Edge (2, 8): Node 2 (Degree 1) < Node 8 (Degree 3)
6. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 (Degree 2) < Node 6 (Degree 3)
7. Edge (4, 7): Node 4 (Degree 2) < Node 7 (Degree 4)
8. Edge (5, 7): Node 5 (Degree 1) < Node 7 (Degree 4)
9. Edge (6, 8): Node 6 (Degree 3) < Node 8 (Degree 3)
10. Edge (7, 9): Node 7 (Degree 4) = Node 9 (Degree 5)

Now, we count the triangles by checking shared connections:
- Triangle 1: <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle 2: <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
