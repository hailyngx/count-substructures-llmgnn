Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on the number of connections they have:
- Vertex 2: 0 connections
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 2 connections
- Vertices 0, 4: 3 connections
- Vertices 1, 5, 8: 4 connections
- Vertices 3, 7: 5 connections
- Vertex 6: 6 connections

Now, let's count the triangles based on the connections between vertices:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 3: <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle 4: <3, 5, 6>
- Triangle 5: <5, 6, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles:
