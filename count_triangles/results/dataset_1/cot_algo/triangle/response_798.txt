Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's arrange the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 6 connections
- Node 9: 1 connection

Since we have 10 nodes, we can relabel them as follows:
- Node 0 (degree 2): A
- Node 1 (degree 2): B
- Node 2 (degree 1): C
- Node 3 (degree 3): D
- Node 4 (degree 4): E
- Node 5 (degree 2): F
- Node 6 (degree 1): G
- Node 7 (degree 2): H
- Node 8 (degree 6): I
- Node 9 (degree 1): J

Now, we will iterate through each edge and count the triangles:
- For the edge (0, 1), we check for shared neighbors: 0 and 1 share neighbor 8 => Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>
- For the edge (0, 8), we do not proceed since the lower labeled node 0 has fewer connections.
- For the edge (1, 8), we check for shared neighbors: 1 and 8 share neighbors 0 and 4 => Triangles formed: <1, 0, 8> and <1, 4, 8>
- For the edge (2, 4), we do not proceed since the lower labeled node 2 has fewer connections.
- For the edge (3, 5), we do not proceed since both nodes have the same degree.
- For the edge (3, 6), we do not proceed since the lower labeled node 3 has more connections.
- For the edge (3, 7), we do not proceed since the lower labeled node 3 has more connections.
- For the edge (4, 2), we check for shared neighbors: 2 and 4 share no neighbors.
- For the edge (4, 8), we check for shared neighbors: 4 and 8 share neighbors 0, 1, and 5 => Triangles formed: <4, 0, 8>, <4, 1, 8>, and <4, 5, 8>
- For the edge (4, 9), we do not proceed since the lower labeled node 4 has more connections.
- For the edge (5, 3), we do not proceed since both nodes have the same degree.
- For the edge (5, 8), we check for shared neighbors: 5 and 8 share neighbor 4 => Triangle formed: <5, 4, 8>
- For the edge (6, 3), we do not proceed since the lower labeled node 6 has fewer connections.
- For the edge (7, 3), we do not proceed since the lower labeled node 7 has fewer connections.
- For the edge (7, 8), we check for shared neighbors: 7 and 8 share no neighbors.
- For the edge (8, 0), we do not proceed since the lower labeled node 8 has more connections.
- For the edge (8, 1), we do not proceed since the lower labeled node 8 has more connections.
- For the edge (8, 4), we do not proceed since the lower labeled node 8 has more connections.
- For the edge (8, 5), we do not proceed since the lower labeled node 8 has more connections.
- For the edge (8, 7), we check for shared neighbors: 7 and 8 share no neighbors.
- For the edge (9, 4), we do not proceed since the lower labeled node 9 has fewer connections.

Finally, we count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <4, 0, 8>, <4, 1, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 4, 8>
