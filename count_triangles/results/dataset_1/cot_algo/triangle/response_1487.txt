Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method first involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices with their degrees is as follows:
0: 4
2: 3
6: 3
7: 4
9: 4
3: 4
5: 5
8: 6
1: 8
4: 6

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

For edge (0, 1):
Vertices 0 and 1 have 4 common neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 9
Therefore, triangle <0, 1, 4> is formed.

For edge (0, 4):
Vertices 0 and 4 have 2 common neighbors: 5, 8
Therefore, triangle <0, 4, 5> is formed.

For edge (0, 5):
Vertices 0 and 5 have 2 common neighbors: 1, 3
Therefore, triangle <0, 1, 5> is formed.

For edge (1, 3):
Vertices 1 and 3 have 2 common neighbors: 5, 8
Therefore, triangle <1, 3, 5> is formed.

For edge (1, 5):
Vertices 1 and 5 have 3 common neighbors: 0, 3, 8
Therefore, triangles <1, 0, 5> and <1, 3, 5> are formed.

For edge (1, 6):
Vertices 1 and 6 have 0 common neighbors.
No triangle is formed.

For edge (1, 8):
Vertices 1 and 8 have 3 common neighbors: 3, 4, 5
Therefore, triangle <1, 3, 8> is formed.

For edge (1, 9):
Vertices 1 and 9 have 2 common neighbors: 4, 7
Therefore, triangle <1, 4, 9> is formed.

For edge (2, 6):
Vertices 2 and 6 have 0 common neighbors.
No triangle is formed.

For edge (2, 7):
Vertices 2 and 7 have 0 common neighbors.
No triangle is formed.

For edge (2, 8):
Vertices 2 and 8 have 2 common neighbors: 1, 3
Therefore, triangle <2, 1, 8> is formed.

For edge (3, 7):
Vertices 3 and 7 have 2 common neighbors: 8, 4
Therefore, triangle <3, 4, 7> is formed.

For edge (3, 8):
Vertices 3 and 8 have 3 common neighbors: 1, 4, 5
Therefore, triangles <3, 1, 8> and <3, 4, 8> are formed.

For edge (4, 7):
Vertices 4 and 7 have 2 common neighbors: 3, 9
Therefore, triangle <4, 3, 7> is formed.

For edge (4, 9):
Vertices 4 and 9 have 2 common neighbors: 1, 7
Therefore, triangle <4, 1, 9> is formed.

For edge (5, 8):
Vertices 5 and 8 have 3 common neighbors: 3, 1, 4
Therefore, triangles <5, 3, 8>, <5, 1, 8>, and <5, 4, 8> are formed.

For edge (7, 9):
Vertices 7 and 9 have 1 common neighbor: 4
Therefore, triangle <7, 4, 9> is formed.

The total number of triangles inside brackets is [15].
