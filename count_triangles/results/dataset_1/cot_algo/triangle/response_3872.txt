Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 8: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5

Following the method, we observe that triangles can be formed as follows:
- From the edge (0, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 6>
- From the edge (0, 4): No triangles
- From the edge (0, 6): Triangle <0, 6, 3>
- From the edge (0, 7): Triangle <0, 7, 1>
- From the edge (1, 5): No triangles
- From the edge (1, 7): No triangles
- From the edge (2, 5): No triangles
- From the edge (2, 9): No triangles
- From the edge (3, 0): Already counted
- From the edge (3, 6): Already counted
- From the edge (3, 9): Triangle <3, 9, 6>
- From the edge (4, 0): Already counted
- From the edge (5, 1): Already counted
- From the edge (5, 2): No triangles
- From the edge (6, 0): Already counted
- From the edge (6, 3): Already counted
- From the edge (6, 7): Triangle <6, 7, 0>
- From the edge (6, 9): Triangle <6, 9, 3>
- From the edge (7, 0): Already counted
- From the edge (7, 1): Already counted
- From the edge (7, 6): Already counted
- From the edge (8, 9): No triangles
- From the edge (9, 2): No triangles
- From the edge (9, 3): Already counted
- From the edge (9, 6): Already counted
- From the edge (9, 8): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
