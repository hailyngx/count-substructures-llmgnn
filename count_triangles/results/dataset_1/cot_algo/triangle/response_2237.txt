Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in non-decreasing order and relabeling them accordingly, we get the following graph:

Nodes: 3, 1, 8, 6, 5, 4, 7, 0, 2, 9

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles by examining each edge:

- (0, 2) forms triangles with nodes {3, 5} and {2, 7}.
- (0, 3) forms a triangle with node 2.
- (0, 4) does not form a triangle since node 4 has higher connections.
- (0, 5) does not form a triangle since node 5 has higher connections.
- (0, 9) forms triangles with nodes {3, 7} and {5, 6}.
- (1, 3) does not form a triangle since both nodes have equal connections.
- (1, 8) does not form a triangle since node 8 has higher connections.
- (2, 3) forms a triangle with node 0.
- (2, 5) does not form a triangle since node 5 has higher connections.
- (2, 6) forms a triangle with node 9.
- (2, 7) does not form a triangle since node 7 has higher connections.
- (3, 0) does not form a triangle since node 0 has higher connections.
- (3, 1) does not form a triangle since node 1 has higher connections.
- (3, 7) does not form a triangle since node 7 has higher connections.
- (3, 9) does not form a triangle since node 9 has higher connections.
- (4, 0) does not form a triangle since node 4 has higher connections.
- (4, 7) does not form a triangle since node 7 has higher connections.
- (4, 8) does not form a triangle since both nodes have equal connections.
- (5, 0) does not form a triangle since node 5 has higher connections.
- (5, 2) does not form a triangle since node 5 has higher connections.
- (5, 9) does not form a triangle since node 9 has higher connections.
- (6, 2) does not form a triangle since node 6 has lower connections.
- (6, 9) does not form a triangle since node 6 has lower connections.
- (7, 2) does not form a triangle since node 7 has higher connections.
- (7, 3) does not form a triangle since node 7 has higher connections.
- (7, 4) does not form a triangle since node 7 has higher connections.
- (7, 9) does not form a triangle since node 7 has higher connections.
- (8, 1) does not form a triangle since node 8 has higher connections.
- (8, 4) does not form a triangle since node 8 has higher connections.
- (9, 0) does not form a triangle since both nodes have equal connections.
- (9, 3) forms a triangle with node 0.
- (9, 5) does not form a triangle since node 9 has higher connections.
- (9, 6) does not form a triangle since node 6 has lower connections.
- (9, 7) does not form a triangle since node 9 has higher connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 5, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 6>.
