Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on the number of connections:

Vertex 0 - 3 connections
Vertex 2 - 2 connections
Vertex 7 - 0 connections
Vertex 9 - 1 connection
Vertex 1 - 4 connections
Vertex 4 - 2 connections
Vertex 5 - 2 connections
Vertex 6 - 3 connections
Vertex 8 - 3 connections
Vertex 3 - 4 connections

We will now relabel the vertices:

Vertex 7 (0 connections) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 9 (1 connection) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 2 (2 connections) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 4 (2 connections) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 5 (2 connections) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 6 (3 connections) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 8 (3 connections) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 0 (3 connections) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 3 (4 connections) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 1 (4 connections) -> Vertex 9

Now we will check for triangles:

- For edge (0, 3):
    Vertex 0 (3 connections) < Vertex 8 (3 connections) -> check shared connections
    Shared connections: 5
    Triangle: <0, 3, 5>

- For edge (0, 5):
    Vertex 0 (3 connections) < Vertex 4 (2 connections) -> proceed
    Vertex 0 (3 connections) < Vertex 4 (2 connections) -> check shared connections
    Shared connections: 1
    Triangle: <0, 5, 1>

- For edge (0, 6):
    Vertex 0 (3 connections) < Vertex 5 (2 connections) -> proceed
    Vertex 0 (3 connections) < Vertex 5 (2 connections) -> check shared connections
    Shared connections: 4
    Triangle: <0, 6, 4>

- For edge (1, 4):
    Vertex 1 (4 connections) > Vertex 3 (2 connections) -> proceed
    Vertex 1 (4 connections) > Vertex 3 (2 connections) -> check shared connections
    Shared connections: 5
    Triangle: <1, 4, 6>

- For edge (1, 5):
    Vertex 1 (4 connections) > Vertex 4 (2 connections) -> proceed
    Vertex 1 (4 connections) > Vertex 4 (2 connections) -> check shared connections
    Shared connections: 0
    Triangle: <1, 5, 0>

- For edge (1, 8):
    Vertex 1 (4 connections) > Vertex 3 (2 connections) -> proceed
    Vertex 1 (4 connections) > Vertex 3 (2 connections) -> check shared connections
    Shared connections: 6
    Triangle: <1, 8, 6>

- For edge (1, 9):
    Vertex 1 (4 connections) = Vertex 9 (1 connection) -> proceed
    Vertex 1 (4 connections) = Vertex 9 (1 connection) -> check shared connections
    Shared connections: 5
    Triangle: <1, 9, 6>

- For edge (2, 3):
    Vertex 2 (2 connections) < Vertex 8 (3 connections) -> check shared connections
    Shared connections: 0
    No triangle formed.

- For edge (3, 8):
    Vertex 2 (2 connections) < Vertex 8 (3 connections) -> check shared connections
    Shared connections: 6
    Triangle: <3, 8, 6>

- For edge (4, 6):
    Vertex 4 (2 connections) < Vertex 5 (2 connections) -> proceed
    Vertex 4 (2 connections) < Vertex 5 (2 connections) -> check shared connections
    Shared connections: 6
    Triangle: <4, 6, 1>

- For edge (6, 8):
    Vertex 5 (2 connections) < Vertex 6 (3 connections) -> check shared connections
    Shared connections: 3
    No triangle formed.

The total number of triangles is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 6, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 0>, <1, 8, 6>.
