Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 2: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 6

Now, we can count the number of triangles by examining the edges with the lower labeled node having fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 7): Forms a triangle with node 5 as they share a connection.
2. Edge (0, 8): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (1, 3): Forms a triangle with node 4 as they share a connection.
4. Edge (1, 4): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (3, 4): No additional triangles formed.
8. Edge (4, 5): Forms a triangle with node 7 as they share a connection.
9. Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (5, 7): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (6, 7): No additional triangles formed.
12. Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, and <4, 5, 7>.
