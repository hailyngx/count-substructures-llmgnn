Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 6
Node 2: degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles formed:
For edge (0, 2): The lower labeled node is 0. Nodes 0 and 2 share nodes 8 and 9. So, triangle <0, 2, 8> and <0, 2, 9> are formed.
For edge (0, 8): The lower labeled node is 0. Nodes 0 and 8 do not share a common neighbor, so no triangles are formed.
For edge (0, 9): The lower labeled node is 0. Nodes 0 and 9 do not share a common neighbor, so no triangles are formed.
For the rest of the edges, the lower labeled node is always 1 and there are no shared neighbors to form triangles.

Finally, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8> and <0, 2, 9>.
