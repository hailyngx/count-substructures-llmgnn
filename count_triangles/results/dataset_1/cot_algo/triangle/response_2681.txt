Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 2 has 2 edges.
Node 3 has 2 edges.
Nodes 1, 5, 7 have 3 edges each.
Nodes 0, 6, 9 have 4 edges each.
Node 4 has 5 edges.
Node 8 has 6 edges.

The triangles identified using the Degree-Based Ordering method are:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
<4, 5, 9>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
