Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 4: degree 1
Vertex 2: degree 1
Vertex 3: degree 1
Vertex 8: degree 1
Vertex 9: degree 2
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 5
Vertex 5: degree 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 4 (degree 1) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 2 (degree 1) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 3 (degree 1) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 8 (degree 1) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 9 (degree 2) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 0 (degree 3) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 6 (degree 3) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 7 (degree 4) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 1 (degree 5) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 5 (degree 5) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Checking edges with the lower labeled vertex first:
  - Edge (0, 1): Forms a triangle with shared connection at vertex 5 -> Triangle <0, 1, 5>
  - Edge (0, 2): No triangles
  - Edge (0, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection at vertex 5 -> Triangle <0, 4, 9>
  - Edge (1, 3): No triangles
  - Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection at vertex 0 -> Triangle <1, 5, 0>
  - Edge (1, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection at vertex 6 -> Triangle <1, 7, 6>
  - Edge (2, 0): No triangles
  - Edge (3, 1): No triangles
  - Edge (6, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection at vertex 1 -> Triangle <6, 7, 1>
  - Edge (7, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection at vertex 5 -> Triangle <7, 8, 5>
  - Edge (9, 0): Forms a triangle with shared connection at vertex 5 -> Triangle <9, 0, 5>
  - Edge (9, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection at vertex 0 -> Triangle <9, 5, 1>

The total number of triangles is 6, and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 0>, <1, 7, 6>, <6, 7, 1>, <7, 8, 5>. So the output will be [6].
