Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labeling is: 
Node 5 is connected to 0 nodes. 
Nodes 1 and 7 are connected to 1 node each. 
Nodes 2 and 6 are connected to 2 nodes each. 
Nodes 4, 8, and 9 are connected to 3 nodes each. 
Nodes 0 and 3 are connected to 4 nodes each. 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles: 
- For the edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 0 and 2 are 3 and 4. Therefore, the triangle formed is <0, 2, 4>. 
- For the edge (0, 3): Shared connections with 0 and 3 are 2 and 4. Therefore, the triangle formed is <0, 3, 2>.
- For the edge (0, 6): Shared connections with 0 and 6 are 4. Therefore, the triangle formed is <0, 6, 4>.
- For the edge (0, 9): Shared connections with 0 and 9 are 1. Therefore, the triangle formed is <0, 9, 1>.
- For the edge (1, 7): Shared connections with 1 and 7 are 4. Therefore, the triangle formed is <1, 7, 4>.
- For the edge (1, 9): Shared connections with 1 and 9 are 0. Therefore, the triangle formed is <1, 9, 0>.
- For the edge (2, 3): Shared connections with 2 and 3 are 0. Therefore, the triangle formed is <2, 3, 0>.
- For the edge (3, 4): Shared connections with 3 and 4 are 0. Therefore, the triangle formed is <3, 4, 0>.
- For the edge (4, 8): Shared connections with 4 and 8 are 3. Therefore, the triangle formed is <4, 8, 3>.
- For the edge (8, 9): Shared connections with 8 and 9 are 0. Therefore, the triangle formed is <8, 9, 0>.

There are 6 unique triangles found in the graph: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 9, 1>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 9, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
