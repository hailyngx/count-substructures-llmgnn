Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
