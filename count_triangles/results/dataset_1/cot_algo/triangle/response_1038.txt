Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is: 

Vertex 2, 7, 0, 3, 8, 5, 4, 1, 9, 6.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we have:

- Edge (0, 9): Vertices {0, 9} have no shared connections.
- Edge (1, 5): Vertices {1, 5} have shared connection with vertex 4 forming triangle <1, 4, 5>.
- Edge (1, 6): Vertices {1, 6} have shared connection with vertex 5 forming triangle <1, 5, 6>.
- Edge (1, 9): Vertices {1, 9} have no shared connections.
- Edge (2, 8): Vertices {2, 8} have no shared connections.
- Edge (3, 6): Vertices {3, 6} have no shared connections.
- Edge (4, 5): Vertices {4, 5} have shared connections with vertices 1 and 8 forming triangles <1, 4, 5> and <4, 5, 8>.
- Edge (4, 6): Vertices {4, 6} have shared connection with vertices 1, 5, and 7 forming triangles <1, 4, 5> and <1, 5, 6> and <4, 6, 7>.
- Edge (4, 8): Vertices {4, 8} have shared connection with vertex 5 forming triangle <4, 5, 8>.
- Edge (5, 1): Skipped as it was processed earlier.
- Edge (5, 4): Skipped as it was processed earlier.
- Edge (5, 8): Vertices {5, 8} have shared connection with vertex 4 forming triangle <4, 5, 8>.
- Edge (6, 1): Skipped as it was processed earlier.
- Edge (6, 3): Vertices {3, 6} have no shared connections.
- Edge (6, 4): Skipped as it was processed earlier.
- Edge (6, 7): Vertices {6, 7} have shared connection with vertex 4 forming triangle <4, 6, 7>.
- Edge (6, 9): Subgraph {6, 1, 9} forms a triangle <1, 6, 9>.
- Edge (7, 6): Skipped as it was processed earlier.
- Edge (8, 2): Skipped as it was processed earlier.
- Edge (8, 4): Skipped as it was processed earlier.
- Edge (8, 5): Skipped as it was processed earlier.
- Edge (9, 0): Vertices {0, 9} have no shared connections.
- Edge (9, 1): Skipped as it was processed earlier.
- Edge (9, 6): Skipped as it was processed earlier.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7], and the unique triangles found are <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 8>.
