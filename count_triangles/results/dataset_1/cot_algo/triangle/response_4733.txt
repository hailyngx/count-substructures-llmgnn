Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices by degree:
0 -> 3 connections
3 -> 2 connections
4 -> 1 connection
6 -> 1 connection
7 -> 2 connections
9 -> 3 connections
1 -> 4 connections
5 -> 3 connections
8 -> 3 connections
2 -> 3 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:
4 -> 0
6 -> 1
7 -> 2
3 -> 3
8 -> 4
5 -> 5
0 -> 6
2 -> 7
9 -> 8
1 -> 9

Now we will check for triangles by examining each edge based on the relabeled vertices:
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 3>
<5, 3, 9>
<5, 3, 8>
<6, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
