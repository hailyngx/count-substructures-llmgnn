Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 0
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Starting from the edge with the lower labeled endpoint:
  - (0, 4): No triangles <0, 4, x>.
  - (0, 6): No triangles <0, 6, x>.
  - (2, 5): Triangle found <2, 5, 3>.
  - (2, 7): No triangles <2, 7, x>.
  - (2, 8): Triangle found <2, 8, 6>.
  - (3, 5): No triangles <3, 5, x>.
  - (3, 6): No triangles <3, 6, x>.
  - (3, 8): Triangle found <3, 8, 6>.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
