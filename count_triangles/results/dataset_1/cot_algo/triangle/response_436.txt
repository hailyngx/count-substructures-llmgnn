Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: <3, 5, 1, 9, 6, 5, 1, 3, 2, 4>

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles as follows:
- Edge (0, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle <0, 4, 7>.
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle <0, 2, 7>.
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle <4, 0, 7>.
- Edge (4, 8) forms a triangle <4, 6, 8>.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 8) forms a triangle <6, 4, 8>.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 4) forms a triangle <7, 0, 4>.
- Edge (7, 8) forms a triangle <7, 4, 8>.
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 7) forms a triangle <8, 4, 7>.
- Edge (9, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <7, 4, 8>
