Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees: 

Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
Node 8: 0
Node 5: 1
Node 9: 2
Node 1: 3
Node 3: 4
Node 0: 5
Node 2: 6
Node 4: 7
Node 7: 8
Node 6: 9

Now, we will check for triangles by examining the edges:

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <0, 3, 8>
5. <0, 7, 8>
6. <1, 2, 6>
7. <1, 3, 5>
8. <1, 3, 8>
9. <2, 4, 6>
10. <2, 6, 9>
11. <3, 5, 9>
12. <4, 6, 7>
13. <5, 9, 4>
14. <6, 7, 4>
15. <6, 8, 4>
16. <6, 8, 7>

Total number of triangles: [16]
