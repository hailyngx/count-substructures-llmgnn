Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are:  

- Node 0: 3 connections  
- Node 5: 4 connections  
- Node 3: 4 connections  
- Node 4: 4 connections  
- Node 7: 4 connections  
- Node 8: 4 connections  
- Node 2: 5 connections  
- Node 6: 5 connections  
- Node 1: 6 connections  
- Node 9: 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can identify the triangles and count them. The total number of triangles in this graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 5, 6>
