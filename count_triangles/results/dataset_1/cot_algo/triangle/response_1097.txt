Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, the vertices will be relabeled based on the number of connections they have:
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 1
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 1
- Node 5: Degree 1
- Node 6: Degree 2
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 2
- Node 9: Degree 3

Next, we will examine each edge based on the vertex with the lower label and count the triangles formed:
1. Edge (0, 3): Check for shared connections of Node 0 and Node 3. Triangle found: <0, 3, 9>
2. Edge (0, 9): Skip because Node 0 has fewer connections.
3. Edge (1, 4): Skip because Node 1 has fewer connections.
4. Edge (2, 5): Skip because Node 2 has more connections.
5. Edge (2, 7): Check for shared connections of Node 2 and Node 7. No triangles found.
6. Edge (2, 8): Skip because Node 2 has more connections.
7. Edge (3, 7): Skip because Node 3 has more connections.
8. Edge (3, 9): Check for shared connections of Node 3 and Node 9. Triangle found: <0, 3, 9>
9. Edge (4, 1): Skip because Node 4 has fewer connections.
10. Edge (5, 2): Skip because Node 5 has fewer connections.
11. Edge (6, 8): Check for shared connections of Node 6 and Node 8. No triangles found.
12. Edge (6, 9): Check for shared connections of Node 6 and Node 9. No triangles found.
13. Edge (7, 2): Check for shared connections of Node 7 and Node 2. No triangles found.
14. Edge (7, 3): Skip because Node 7 has more connections.
15. Edge (8, 2): Skip because Node 8 has more connections.
16. Edge (8, 6): Check for shared connections of Node 8 and Node 6. No triangles found.
17. Edge (9, 0): Check for shared connections of Node 9 and Node 0. Triangle found: <0, 3, 9>
18. Edge (9, 3): Check for shared connections of Node 9 and Node 3. Triangle found: <0, 3, 9>
19. Edge (9, 6): Check for shared connections of Node 9 and Node 6. No triangles found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 9>.
