Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

Node Degrees:
0: 5
1: 4
2: 2
3: 2
4: 6
5: 2
6: 2
7: 4
8: 3
9: 6

Sorting by Degrees:
2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 1, 7, 9, 0, 4

Edges to analyze:
(2, 4) - Proceed
(3, 1) - Proceed
(3, 8) - Proceed
(5, 0) - Proceed
(6, 4) - Proceed
(6, 7) - Proceed
(8, 3) - Proceed
(8, 4) - Proceed
(5, 9) - Proceed
(9, 7) - Proceed
(9, 8) - Proceed

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<8, 9, 4>
