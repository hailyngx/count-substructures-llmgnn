Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we get the following labels for the vertices: 

Node 0 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 7

Now we will consider the edges in the order specified, where we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <0, 3, 8>
2. Edge (0, 8) does not lead to a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 2) does not lead to a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 3) does not lead to a triangle.
5. Edge (1, 4) does not lead to a triangle.
6. Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <1, 3, 5>
7. Edge (2, 1) does not lead to a triangle.
8. Edge (2, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <2, 3, 6>
9. Edge (3, 0) does not lead to a triangle.
10. Edge (3, 1) does not lead to a triangle.
11. Edge (3, 2) does not lead to a triangle.
12. Edge (3, 5) does not lead to a triangle.
13. Edge (3, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <3, 6, 7>
14. Edge (3, 7) does not lead to a triangle.
15. Edge (4, 1) does not lead to a triangle.
16. Edge (4, 5) does not lead to a triangle.
17. Edge (5, 1) does not lead to a triangle.
18. Edge (5, 3) does not lead to a triangle.
19. Edge (5, 4) does not lead to a triangle.
20. Edge (5, 9) does not lead to a triangle.
21. Edge (6, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <2, 3, 6>
22. Edge (6, 3) does not lead to a triangle.
23. Edge (7, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <3, 6, 7>
24. Edge (7, 8) does not lead to a triangle.
25. Edge (7, 9) does not lead to a triangle.
26. Edge (8, 0) does not lead to a triangle.
27. Edge (8, 7) does not lead to a triangle.
28. Edge (9, 5) does not lead to a triangle.
29. Edge (9, 7) does not lead to a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, and <3, 6, 7>.
