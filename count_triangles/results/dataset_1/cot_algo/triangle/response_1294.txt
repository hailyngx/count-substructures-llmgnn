Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 1 (1 connection): 1
- Node 7 (1 connection): 2
- Node 0 (2 connections): 3
- Node 5 (2 connections): 4
- Node 7 (2 connections): 5
- Node 4 (3 connections): 6
- Node 3 (4 connections): 7
- Node 2 (5 connections): 8
- Node 5 (5 connections): 9
- Node 9 (5 connections): 10

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now determine the total number of triangles and the unique triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 4]
Unique triangles:
<2, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 4>
