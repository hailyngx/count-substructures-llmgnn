Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 3
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 5
- Vertex 3: degree 6
- Vertex 8: not present

Following the degree-based ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the smaller label has fewer connections, we find the triangles:
1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <3, 5, 7>
3. <3, 5, 2>
4. <3, 5, 0>
5. <4, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
