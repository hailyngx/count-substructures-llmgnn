Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degrees of each vertex:
- Vertex 0 has degree 4
- Vertex 1 has degree 5
- Vertex 2 has degree 4
- Vertex 3 has degree 2
- Vertex 4 has degree 1
- Vertex 5 has degree 2
- Vertex 6 has degree 2
- Vertex 7 has degree 3
- Vertex 8 has degree 2
- Vertex 9 has degree 3

Sorting the vertices by degree in ascending order: 4, 6, 8, 5, 7, 9, 3, 0, 2, 1

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Vertex 0 will be relabeled as 7
- Vertex 1 will be relabeled as 9
- Vertex 2 will be relabeled as 1
- Vertex 3 will be relabeled as 5
- Vertex 4 will be relabeled as 2
- Vertex 5 will be relabeled as 8
- Vertex 6 will be relabeled as 4
- Vertex 7 will be relabeled as 6
- Vertex 8 will be relabeled as 3
- Vertex 9 will be relabeled as 10

Now, we will list the edges with the relabeled vertices:
(7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (9, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (5, 9) (5, 10) (4, 1) (8, 3) (8, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (6, 7) (6, 1) (10, 9) (10, 1)

Now, we will count the triangles:
- <1, 7, 9>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 6, 10>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <1, 7, 10>
- <4, 6, 9>

Count of triangles: [8]
