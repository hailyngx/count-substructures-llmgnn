Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph sorted by the number of connections for each vertex is as follows:
Nodes: 1, 4, 7, 0, 8, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 has connections with node 1. Node 1 has 0 common connections.
2. Edge (0, 3): Node 0 has connections with nodes 1 and 3. Node 3 has a connection with node 1. Nodes 1 and 3 have a common connection with node 0, forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.
3. Edge (1, 0) is the same as edge (0, 1) already considered.
4. Edge (3, 0) is the same as edge (0, 3) already considered.
5. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has connections with nodes 0 and 4. Node 4 has a connection with node 3. Nodes 0 and 4 have a common connection with node 3, forming a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
6. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 has connections with nodes 0, 4, and 8. Node 8 has connections with nodes 3 and 9. Nodes 3 and 8 have a common connection forming a triangle <3, 8, 9>.
7. Edge (3, 9): Node 3 has connections with nodes 0, 4, and 8. Node 9 has connections with nodes 6 and 8. Nodes 3 and 9 have a common connection with node 8, forming a triangle <3, 8, 9>.
8. Edge (4, 3) is the same as edge (3, 4) already considered.
9. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 has a connection with node 7. Node 7 has 0 common connections.
10. Edge (6, 9): Node 6 has a connection with nodes 7 and 9. Node 9 has connections with nodes 6 and 8. Nodes 6 and 9 have a common connection with node 8, forming a triangle <6, 8, 9>.
11. Edge (7, 6) is the same as edge (6, 7) already considered.
12. Edge (8, 3) is the same as edge (3, 8) already considered.
13. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 has connections with nodes 3 and 9. Node 9 has connections with nodes 6 and 8. Nodes 8 and 9 have a common connection with node 6, forming a triangle <6, 8, 9>.
14. Edge (9, 6) is the same as edge (6, 9) already considered.
15. Edge (9, 8) is the same as edge (8, 9) already considered.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <3, 8, 9>, and <6, 8, 9>.
