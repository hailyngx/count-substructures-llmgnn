Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). Then we relabel the vertices and identify the triangles formed by shared connections between vertices of each edge. 

Vertices with their connections (degrees) are as follows:
- 0 (3)
- 1 (1)
- 2 (0)
- 3 (0)
- 4 (2)
- 5 (2)
- 6 (3)
- 7 (3)
- 8 (1)
- 9 (3)

After relabeling based on degree:
- 2 (0)
- 3 (0)
- 1 (1)
- 8 (1)
- 4 (2)
- 5 (2)
- 0 (3)
- 6 (3)
- 7 (3)
- 9 (3)

Now, we can analyze the edges while ensuring we only count triangles once:
- Edge (0, 1): No triangles.
- Edge (0, 8): No triangles.
- Edge (0, 9): Triangle formed with vertex 6: <0, 6, 9>.
- Edge (1, 0): No triangles.
- Edge (4, 7): No triangles.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangles.
- Edge (5, 7): No triangles.
- Edge (6, 5): No triangles.
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles.
- Edge (7, 4): No triangles.
- Edge (7, 5): No triangles.
- Edge (8, 0): No triangles.
- Edge (9, 0): No triangles.
- Edge (9, 6): No triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 6, 9>.
