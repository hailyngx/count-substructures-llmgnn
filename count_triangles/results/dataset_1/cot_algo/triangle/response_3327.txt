Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows: 

Node 5: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with node 3: <0, 1, 3>
- Edge (0, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 3, 4>
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) forms a triangle with node 7: <0, 7, 9>
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 8) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>
