Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the vertices are relabeled as: 

Node 6 -> 0 connections
Node 5 -> 1 connection
Node 9 -> 1 connection
Node 8 -> 2 connections
Node 2 -> 2 connections
Node 3 -> 3 connections
Node 1 -> 3 connections
Node 4 -> 5 connections
Node 7 -> 9 connections
Node 0 -> 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles:

1. Checking edge (0, 4):
   - Shared connection with nodes 2 and 7. Triangle <0, 2, 7>.

2. Checking edge (0, 7):
   - Shared connection with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Triangles <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 2, 4>, and <0, 3, 7>.

3. Checking edge (0, 8):
   - No triangles since node 0 has 4 connections which is more than nodes 5 and 9.

4. Checking edge (1, 3):
   - No triangles since node 1 has 3 connections which is more than node 2.

5. Checking edge (1, 7):
   - Shared connection with nodes 0, 2, and 4. Triangles <1, 0, 2> and <1, 2, 4>.

6. Checking edge (3, 1):
   - No triangles since the edge was already processed.

7. Checking edge (3, 7):
   - Shared connections with nodes 0, 2, and 4. Triangles <3, 0, 2> and <3, 2, 4>.

8. Checking edge (5, 7):
   - No triangles since node 5 has 1 connection which is more than nodes 0, 2, and 4.

9. Checking edge (8, 7):
   - No triangles since node 8 has 2 connections which is more than nodes 5 and 9.

10. Checking edge (9, 7):
   - No triangles since node 9 has 1 connection which is more than nodes 5 and 1.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 0, 2>, and <1, 2, 4>.
