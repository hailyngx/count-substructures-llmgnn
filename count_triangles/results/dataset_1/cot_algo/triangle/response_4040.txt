Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling will be: 

Nodes: 3, 4, 0, 7, 9, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Looking at the edges (0, 1) and (1, 0):
    - Node 0 (degree 2) and Node 1 (degree 4) proceed because node 0 has fewer connections.
    - Shared connection: Node 8
    - Formed triangle: <0, 1, 8>

2. Looking at the edges (0, 8) and (8, 0):
    - Node 0 (degree 2) and Node 8 (degree 4) proceed because node 0 has fewer connections.
    - Shared connection: Node 1
    - Formed triangle: <0, 8, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
