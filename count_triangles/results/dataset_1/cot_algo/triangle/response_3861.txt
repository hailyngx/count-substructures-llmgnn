Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the new list of edges becomes:
(0, 1) (2, 4) (6, 2) (7, 5) (9, 0) (5, 7) (8, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (5, 4) (1, 3) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (6, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (1, 9) (4, 8) (5, 8) (9, 3) (2, 6) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (9, 3) (8, 7)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections, we can find the total number of triangles to be [8]. The unique triangles found are <3, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 2>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 9>.
