Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 6: degree 1
Node 1: degree 1
Node 2: degree 1
Node 5: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 6
Node 4: degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- For edge (0, 4): Node 0 has degree 3, Node 4 has degree 4, and they share 3 neighbors (7, 5, 9). This forms a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
- For edge (0, 5): Node 0 has degree 3, Node 5 has degree 2, and they share 2 neighbors (9, 7). This forms a triangle <0, 5, 9>.
- For edge (0, 7): Node 0 has degree 3, Node 7 has degree 3, and they share 2 neighbors (4, 9). This forms a triangle <0, 7, 4>.
- For edge (4, 7): Node 4 has degree 4, Node 7 has degree 3, and they share 3 neighbors (0, 9, 8). This forms a triangle <4, 7, 9>.
- For edge (7, 8): Node 7 has degree 3, Node 8 has degree 3, and they share 2 neighbors (4, 9). This forms a triangle <7, 8, 4>.
- For edge (8, 9): Node 8 has degree 3, Node 9 has degree 6, and they share 3 neighbors (4, 5, 7). This forms a triangle <8, 9, 4>.
- For edge (9, 5): Node 9 has degree 6, Node 5 has degree 2, and they share 2 neighbors (0, 4). This forms a triangle <9, 5, 0>.
- For edge (9, 4): Node 9 has degree 6, Node 4 has degree 4, and they share 4 neighbors (0, 7, 5, 8). This forms two triangles: <9, 4, 0> and <9, 4, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7] and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 4>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 4>
<8, 9, 4>
<9, 5, 0>
