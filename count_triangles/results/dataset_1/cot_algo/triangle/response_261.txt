Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices in increasing order of connections:
(3 connections) : 4, 5, 8
(4 connections) : 0, 7
(5 connections) : 2
(6 connections) : 3
(7 connections) : 1, 9
(8 connections) : 6

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 → 0
1 → 4
2 → 5
3 → 8
4 → 1
5 → 7
6 → 3
7 → 6
8 → 2
9 → 9

With this relabeling, the edges become:
(0, 6) (0, 9)
(4, 5)
(1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9)
(5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9)
(3, 8) (3, 6)
(6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1)
(7, 1) (7, 9)
(2, 5) (2, 9)
(9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Now, we will count the triangles formed using these relabeled edges:

[Total number of triangles: 6]

<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
