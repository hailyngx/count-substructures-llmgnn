Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently.

By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following order: (4, 5, 8, 0, 7, 6, 1, 3, 9, 2).

Now, let's explore the edges and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): They share a connection at 6 forming a triangle <0, 2, 6>.
2. Edge (0, 4): No triangles.
3. Edge (0, 6): No triangles.
4. Edge (2, 5): No triangles.
5. Edge (2, 6): No triangles.
6. Edge (2, 7): No triangles.
7. Edge (2, 8): They share a connection at 4 forming a triangle <2, 4, 8>.
8. Edge (4, 8): No triangles.
9. Edge (5, 2): No triangles.
10. Edge (6, 7): They share a connection at 2 forming a triangle <6, 2, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 6> and <2, 4, 8>.
