Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are:
0 -> 3 connections
1 -> 4 connections
4 -> 2 connections
6 -> 1 connection
8 -> 1 connection
2 -> 2 connections
5 -> 5 connections
3 -> 3 connections
9 -> 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we consider the edges starting from vertices with fewer connections.

Checking the edges:
(4, 5) forms a triangle with (1, 5)
(6, 5) forms a triangle with (5, 1)
(8, 5) forms a triangle with (5, 1)
(3, 9) forms a triangle with (9, 1)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are <4, 5, 1> and <3, 9, 1>.
