Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 3 -> 0 connections
Node 1 -> 1 connection
Node 5 -> 2 connections
Node 4 -> 2 connections
Node 7 -> 2 connections
Node 6 -> 3 connections
Node 8 -> 3 connections
Node 9 -> 3 connections
Node 0 -> 4 connections
Node 2 -> 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- For edge (0, 2): Both nodes have 4 connections each, so proceed.
- For edge (0, 3): Node 3 has 0 connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (0, 7): Node 7 has 2 connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (0, 8): Node 8 has 3 connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (1, 5): Both nodes have 1 connection each, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (2, 4): Both nodes have 4 connections each, so proceed.
- For edge (2, 6): Node 2 has 4 connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (2, 9): Node 9 has 3 connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (3, 0): Node 3 has 0 connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (4, 6): Both nodes have 2 connections each, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (5, 1): Both nodes have 1 connection each, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (5, 8): Node 8 has 3 connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (6, 4): Both nodes have 2 connections each, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (7, 0): Node 7 has 2 connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (7, 9): Node 7 and Node 9 share Node 2 as a connection, thus forming a triangle {7, 2, 9}.
- For edge (8, 0): Node 8 has 3 connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (8, 5): Node 5 has 2 connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (9, 2): Node 9 has 3 connections, so no triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1], and the unique triangle found is <7, 2, 9>.
