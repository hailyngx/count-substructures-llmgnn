Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
(0: 1 connection), (1: 2 connections), (6: 2 connections), (4: 2 connections), (9: 3 connections), (7: 4 connections), (5: 4 connections), (3: 5 connections), (8: 5 connections), (2: 6 connections).

Now, we will consider only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (0, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 2, 4>
- (1, 4) does not form a triangle (vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 4).
- (1, 7) does not form a triangle (vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 7).
- (2, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 2, 4>
- (2, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <0, 2, 3>
- (2, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <0, 2, 4>
- (3, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 2, 3>
- (3, 5) does not form a triangle (vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 5).
- (3, 8) does not form a triangle (vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 8).
- (3, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <2, 3, 9>
- (4, 1) does not form a triangle (vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 1).
- (4, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 2, 4>
- (5, 3) does not form a triangle (vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 3).
- (5, 7) does not form a triangle (vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 7).
- (5, 8) does not form a triangle (vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 8).
- (5, 9) does not form a triangle (vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 9).
- (6, 7) does not form a triangle (vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 7).
- (7, 1) does not form a triangle (vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 1).
- (7, 5) does not form a triangle (vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 5).
- (7, 6) does not form a triangle (vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 6).
- (7, 8) does not form a triangle (vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 8).
- (8, 3) does not form a triangle (vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 3).
- (8, 5) does not form a triangle (vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 5).
- (8, 7) does not form a triangle (vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 7).
- (8, 9) does not form a triangle (vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 9).
- (9, 2) does not form a triangle (vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 2).
- (9, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <2, 3, 9>
- (9, 5) does not form a triangle (vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 5).
- (9, 8) does not form a triangle (vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 8).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 3>, and <2, 3, 9>.
