Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 3: degree 1
Node 1: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 9: degree 5
Node 2: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:
1. (0, 2) and (0, 5) share a connection at node 0, forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
2. (0, 2) and (0, 9) share a connection at node 0, forming a triangle <0, 2, 9>.
3. (0, 5) and (0, 9) share a connection at node 0, forming a triangle <0, 5, 9>.
4. (3, 9) does not form a triangle as node 3 has degree 1.
5. (7, 9) does not form a triangle as node 7 has degree 2.
6. (2, 1) does not form a triangle since node 1 has degree 2.
7. (4, 6) does not form a triangle since both nodes have degree 3.
8. (4, 9) and (4, 2) share a connection at node 4, forming a triangle <4, 2, 9>.
9. (6, 7) does not form a triangle since both nodes have degree 3.
10. (7, 8) does not form a triangle since both nodes have degree 2.
11. (5, 8) and (5, 1) share a connection at node 5, forming a triangle <5, 1, 8>.
12. (6, 5) does not form a triangle since node 6 has degree 3.
13. (6, 4) does not form a triangle since both nodes have degree 3.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 9>.
