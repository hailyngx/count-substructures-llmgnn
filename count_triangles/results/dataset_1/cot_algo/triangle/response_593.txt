Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

0: 4 connections
1: 1 connection
3: 1 connection
4: 1 connection
6: 1 connection
9: 1 connection
7: 2 connections
8: 3 connections
5: 6 connections

Now, starting with the edge between vertices 0 and 5, we will check for triangles:

- Edge (0, 5): Both vertices have 4 connections in common with vertices 1, 3, 4, and 8. So, we have 4 triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, and <0, 8, 5>.

- Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has 3 connections (5, 7, 9) while vertex 8 has 2 connections (7, 5). They share one connection (7) forming a triangle. We have one more triangle: <0, 7, 8>.

- Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has a connection with vertex 9, but they do not form a triangle with any other vertices.

- Edge (1, 5): Vertices 1 and 5 do not form a triangle with any other vertices.

- Edge (3, 5): Vertices 3 and 5 do not form a triangle with any other vertices.

- Edge (4, 5): Vertices 4 and 5 do not form a triangle with any other vertices.

- Edge (5, 0): We already counted triangles from this edge.

- Edge (5, 1): We already counted triangles from this edge.

- Edge (5, 3): We already counted triangles from this edge.

- Edge (5, 4): We already counted triangles from this edge.

- Edge (6, 7): Vertices 6 and 7 do not form a triangle with any other vertices.

- Edge (7, 6): We already counted triangles from this edge.

- Edge (7, 8): Vertex 7 has 2 connections (6, 8) while vertex 8 has 3 connections (0, 7, 5). They share a connection (7) forming a triangle. We have one more triangle: <7, 0, 8>.

- Edge (8, 0): We already counted triangles from this edge.

- Edge (8, 7): We already counted triangles from this edge.

- Edge (9, 0): We already checked this edge.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 7, 8>, <7, 0, 8>, and <0, 8, 5>.
