Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
0 (degree 1)
7 (degree 1)
6 (degree 1)
2 (degree 1)
5 (degree 0)
8 (degree 2)
1 (degree 2)
9 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
4 (degree 4)

Now, we re-label the vertices based on their sorted order:
0→0, 7→1, 6→2, 2→3, 5→4, 8→5, 1→6, 9→7, 3→8, 4→9

The edges to consider based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
(0, 8), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 9), (6, 9)

Now, we count the triangles by checking shared connections between the two vertices of each edge:

Triangles:
<4, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1], and the unique triangle found is <4, 9, 3>.
