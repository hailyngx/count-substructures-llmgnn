Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

| Node | Connections | Sorted Order |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 0    | 2           | 4            |
| 1    | 2           | 5            |
| 2    | 2           | 0            |
| 3    | 2           | 6            |
| 4    | 4           | 9            |
| 5    | 3           | 1            |
| 6    | 1           | 3            |
| 7    | 3           | 8            |
| 8    | 4           | 2            |
| 9    | 4           | 7            |

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles and the unique triangles in the graph:
[The total number of triangles is 3]
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
