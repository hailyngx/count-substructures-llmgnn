Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Vertex 0 is connected to 2 vertices.
Vertex 7 is connected to 2 vertices.
Vertex 6 is connected to 3 vertices.
Vertex 2 is connected to 4 vertices.
Vertex 5 is connected to 4 vertices.
Vertex 1 is connected to 5 vertices.
Vertex 9 is connected to 5 vertices.
Vertex 8 is connected to 5 vertices.
Vertex 3 is connected to 6 vertices.
Vertex 4 is connected to 7 vertices.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can find the triangles in the graph:

Triangles: 
1. <1, 4, 8>
2. <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
