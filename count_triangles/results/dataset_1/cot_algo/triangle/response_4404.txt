Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by the number of connections are: 0, 5, 6, 8, 3, 0, 4, 6, 0, 1

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:
- For the edge (0, 4): vertices 0 and 4 do not have fewer connections, so we skip this edge.
- For the edge (1, 2): vertices 1 and 2 have fewer connections, and they have a shared connection with vertex 7, forming a triangle <1, 2, 7>.
- For the edge (1, 3): vertices 1 and 3 do not have fewer connections, so we skip this edge.
- For the edge (1, 7): vertices 1 and 7 have fewer connections, and they have a shared connection with vertex 2, forming a triangle <1, 2, 7>.
- For the edge (1, 8): vertices 1 and 8 do not have fewer connections, so we skip this edge.
- For the edge (2, 1): this edge has already been considered.
- For the edge (2, 4): this edge has already been considered.
- For the edge (2, 6): vertices 2 and 6 do not have fewer connections, so we skip this edge.
- For the edge (2, 7): this edge has already been considered.
- For the edge (3, 1): this edge has already been considered.
- For the edge (4, 0): this edge has already been considered.
- For the edge (4, 2): this edge has already been considered.
- For the edge (5, 7): vertices 5 and 7 have fewer connections, and they have a shared connection with vertex 2, forming a triangle <2, 5, 7>.
- For the edge (6, 2): this edge has already been considered.
- For the edge (7, 1): this edge has already been considered.
- For the edge (7, 2): this edge has already been considered.
- For the edge (7, 5): this edge has already been considered.
- For the edge (8, 1): this edge has already been considered.

The total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 7> and <2, 5, 7>.
