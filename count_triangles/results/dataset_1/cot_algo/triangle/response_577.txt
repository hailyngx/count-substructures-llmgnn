Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

0 (degree 1), 1 (degree 1), 3 (degree 1), 8 (degree 1), 5 (degree 2), 7 (degree 2), 9 (degree 2), 6 (degree 4), 4 (degree 6), 2 (degree 7).

Now, let's check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Triangles found:
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
