Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows:
Vertices: 1, 6, 9, 4, 8, 5, 7, 0, 3, 2

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will count the triangles formed by the edges considering the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections.

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 3>
