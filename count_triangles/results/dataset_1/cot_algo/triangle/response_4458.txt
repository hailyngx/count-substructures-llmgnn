Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on the number of connections they have:

Node 6: 0 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

Next, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 6 (0 connections) -> Node 0
Node 2 (1 connection) -> Node 1
Node 5 (1 connection) -> Node 2
Node 8 (2 connections) -> Node 3
Node 1 (3 connections) -> Node 4
Node 9 (3 connections) -> Node 5
Node 5 (3 connections) -> Node 6
Node 3 (4 connections) -> Node 7
Node 4 (5 connections) -> Node 8
Node 7 (6 connections) -> Node 9

Now, we will consider each edge in the graph and count the triangles:

1. (0, 3): Node 0 and Node 7 have a shared connection with Node 4. Therefore, <0, 3, 4> forms a triangle.
2. (0, 7): No triangle is formed.
3. (0, 9): No triangle is formed.
4. (1, 4): Node 4 and Node 1 have shared connections with Node 3. Therefore, <1, 4, 3> forms a triangle.
5. (1, 5): No triangle is formed.
6. (1, 8): No triangle is formed.
7. (2, 7): No triangle is formed.
8. (3, 0): No triangle is formed.
9. (3, 4): No triangle is formed.
10. (3, 7): Node 3 and Node 7 have shared connections with Node 4. Therefore, <3, 7, 4> forms a triangle.
11. (4, 1): No triangle is formed.
12. (4, 3): No triangle is formed.
13. (4, 5): No triangle is formed.
14. (4, 7): No triangle is formed.
15. (4, 8): No triangle is formed.
16. (5, 1): No triangle is formed.
17. (5, 4): No triangle is formed.
18. (7, 0): No triangle is formed.
19. (7, 2): No triangle is formed.
20. (7, 3): No triangle is formed.
21. (7, 4): No triangle is formed.
22. (7, 9): No triangle is formed.
23. (8, 1): No triangle is formed.
24. (8, 4): No triangle is formed.
25. (8, 9): No triangle is formed.
26. (9, 0): No triangle is formed.
27. (9, 7): No triangle is formed.
28. (9, 8): No triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4> and <3, 7, 4>.
