Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
- Vertex 4: 0 connections
- Vertex 5: 0 connections
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 0: 5 connections

Now we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Vertex 4 (0 connections) -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 5 (0 connections) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 4 (1 connection) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 8 (2 connections) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 1 (2 connections) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 2 (2 connections) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 6 (3 connections) -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 9 (3 connections) -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 7 (4 connections) -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 0 (5 connections) -> Vertex 9

We will now analyze the edges based on the relabeled vertices:
- (0, 1): Not valid as both vertices have the same label.
- (0, 3): Potential triangle: shared connection with Vertex 9.
- (0, 5): Not valid as Vertex 1 has a higher label.
- (0, 7): Not valid as Vertex 1 has a higher label.
- (0, 9): Potential triangle: shared connection with Vertex 3.
- (1, 3): Not valid as both vertices have the same label.
- (1, 7): Not valid as Vertex 3 has a higher label.
- (2, 3): Not valid as both vertices have the same label.
- (2, 8): Not valid as both vertices have the same label.
- (3, 6): Potential triangle: shared connection with Vertex 7.
- (3, 8): Not valid as Vertex 3 has a higher label.
- (5, 0): Not valid as Vertex 1 has a higher label.
- (6, 7): Potential triangle: shared connection with Vertex 9.
- (6, 9): Potential triangle: shared connection with Vertex 7.
- (7, 0): Not valid as Vertex 1 has a higher label.
- (8, 2): Not valid as both vertices have the same label.
- (8, 3): Not valid as Vertex 3 has a higher label.
- (8, 9): Not valid as both vertices have the same label.
- (9, 0): Not valid as Vertex 3 has a higher label.

Based on the analysis, there are 4 triangles:
- <0, 3, 9>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <0, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
