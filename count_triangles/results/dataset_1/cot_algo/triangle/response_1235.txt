Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:
- Sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections): <4, 5, 8, 3, 9, 1, 6, 0, 7, 2>
- Relabel the vertices based on their sorting: <0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9>

Now, we will traverse the edges and count the triangles formed:
- Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 has 4 connections, and Vertex 1 has 3 connections. Check for shared connections: 1
- Edge (0, 2): Vertex 0 has 4 connections, and Vertex 2 has 4 connections. Check for shared connections: 2
- Edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 has 4 connections, and Vertex 7 has 3 connections. Check for shared connections: None
- Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has 4 connections, and Vertex 9 has 4 connections. Check for shared connections: 2

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2> <0, 2, 9> <1, 2, 6>
