Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering is as follows:
Node 7 -> 0 connection
Node 8 -> 1 connection
Node 4 -> 2 connections
Node 9 -> 2 connections
Node 3 -> 2 connections
Node 5 -> 3 connections
Node 2 -> 3 connections
Node 1 -> 4 connections
Node 6 -> 5 connections
Node 0 -> 5 connections

By following the degree-based ordering method and the given edges, we can count the triangles as follows:
1. (2, 5, 6)
2. (0, 1, 6)
3. (0, 6, 9)
4. (1, 2, 5)
5. (1, 3, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles are <2, 5, 6>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 9>.
