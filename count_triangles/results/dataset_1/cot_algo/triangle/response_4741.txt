Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 4)
3 (degree 1)
7 (degree 3)
2 (degree 3)
8 (degree 3)
5 (degree 6)
4 (degree 5)
6 (degree 5)
9 (degree 4)

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 (degree 2) -> 0
3 (degree 1) -> 1
7 (degree 3) -> 2
2 (degree 3) -> 3
8 (degree 3) -> 4
1 (degree 4) -> 5
9 (degree 4) -> 6
5 (degree 6) -> 7
4 (degree 5) -> 8
6 (degree 5) -> 9

Based on the degrees and labels, we will now find the triangles:
Triangles: <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
