Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for each node are:
Node 0 - Degree 3
Node 1 - Degree 1
Node 4 - Degree 2
Node 5 - Degree 2
Node 6 - Degree 3
Node 9 - Degree 3
Node 8 - Degree 4
Node 7 - Degree 4
Node 3 - Degree 4
Node 2 - Degree 9

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we count the triangles:
1. For edge (0, 2): Shared connections with node 3 form a triangle <0, 2, 3>.
2. For edge (0, 6): No triangles.
3. For edge (1, 2): No triangles.
4. For edge (4, 6): No triangles.
5. For edge (5, 7): No triangles.
6. For edge (4, 9): No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [1]
