Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree x
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 1
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
Examining each edge in the given list, we have:
- Edge between vertices 0 and 6 forms a triangle with vertex 1: <0, 1, 6>
- Edge between vertices 0 and 9 forms a triangle with vertex 1: <0, 1, 9>
- Edge between vertices 1 and 6 forms a triangle with vertex 0: <1, 0, 6>
- Edge between vertices 1 and 9 forms a triangle with vertex 0: <1, 0, 9>
- Edge between vertices 2 and 4 does not form a triangle due to degree ordering.
- Edge between vertices 2 and 7 does not form a triangle due to degree ordering.
- Edge between vertices 2 and 8 forms a triangle with vertex 5: <2, 5, 8>
- Edge between vertices 4 and 2 does not form a triangle due to degree ordering.
- Edge between vertices 5 and 8 does not form a triangle due to degree ordering.
- Edge between vertices 6 and 0 forms a triangle with vertex 1: <6, 0, 1>
- Edge between vertices 6 and 1 forms a triangle with vertex 0: <6, 0, 1>
- Edge between vertices 6 and 7 does not form a triangle due to degree ordering.
- Edge between vertices 6 and 9 forms a triangle with vertex 1: <6, 1, 9>
- Edge between vertices 7 and 2 does not form a triangle due to degree ordering.
- Edge between vertices 7 and 6 does not form a triangle due to degree ordering.
- Edge between vertices 8 and 2 forms a triangle with vertex 5: <8, 2, 5>
- Edge between vertices 8 and 5 does not form a triangle due to degree ordering.
- Edge between vertices 8 and 9 forms a triangle with vertex 5: <8, 5, 9>
- Edge between vertices 9 and 0 forms a triangle with vertex 1: <9, 0, 1>
- Edge between vertices 9 and 1 forms a triangle with vertex 0: <9, 0, 1>
- Edge between vertices 9 and 6 forms a triangle with vertex 1: <9, 1, 6>
- Edge between vertices 9 and 8 forms a triangle with vertex 5: <9, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph, as counted using Degree-Based Ordering, is [10].
