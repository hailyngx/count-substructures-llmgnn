Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 3 with 2 connections.
Vertices 0, 2, 9 with 3 connections.
Vertices 1, 7 with 5 connections.
Vertices 4, 5, 6, 8 with 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can now count the number of triangles.

Calculating the triangles:
1. Triangle <1, 3, 4> (shared connection with vertex 1).
2. Triangle <1, 3, 5> (shared connection with vertex 1).
3. Triangle <1, 4, 8> (shared connection with vertex 1).
4. Triangle <1, 5, 9> (shared connection with vertex 1).
5. Triangle <3, 4, 5> (shared connection with vertex 4).
6. Triangle <4, 5, 8> (shared connection with vertex 8).
7. Triangle <1, 4, 5> (shared connection with vertex 5).

Total number of triangles: [7]
