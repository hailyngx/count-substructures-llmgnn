Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 1 has 1 connection.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 5 connections.
Node 8 has 5 connections.
Node 4 has 6 connections.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes, so it is not included in the list.

Next, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Since Node 1 and Node 6 have the least number of connections, we start with their edges.
- Moving on to Node 0, Node 9, and so on, we count the triangles formed by shared connections between the vertices linked by edges.
- By applying this method, we find that there are a total of [14] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 5>, <3, 1, 4>, <3, 1, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 5>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 1, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 8>.
