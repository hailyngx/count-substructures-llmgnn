Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 1: 1 connection
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Now, let's relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 6 (0 connections) -> Node 0
Node 1 (1 connection) -> Node 1
Node 8 (1 connection) -> Node 6
Node 7 (2 connections) -> Node 2
Node 5 (3 connections) -> Node 3
Node 9 (2 connections) -> Node 4
Node 3 (3 connections) -> Node 5
Node 4 (4 connections) -> Node 7
Node 2 (5 connections) -> Node 8
Node 0 (4 connections) -> Node 9

Now, let's look at the edges and count the triangles:

(0, 2): Node 0 and Node 8 share Node 2 -> Triangle <0, 2, 8>
(0, 3): Node 0 and Node 9 share Node 3 -> Triangle <0, 3, 9>
(0, 4): Node 0 and Node 9 share Node 4 -> Triangle <0, 4, 9>
(0, 7): Node 0 and Node 9 share Node 7 -> Triangle <0, 7, 9>
(1, 9): No triangles formed as Node 1 is connected to Node 9 but no shared connection with a third node.
(2, 3): Node 2 and Node 8 share Node 3 -> Triangle <2, 3, 8>
(2, 4): Node 2 and Node 8 share Node 4 -> Triangle <2, 4, 8>
(2, 5): Node 2 and Node 8 share Node 5 -> Triangle <2, 5, 8>
(2, 9): Node 2 and Node 8 share Node 9 -> Triangle <2, 9, 8>
(3, 5): Node 3 and Node 5 share Node 2 -> Triangle <3, 5, 2>
(4, 7): Node 4 and Node 9 share Node 7 -> Triangle <4, 7, 9>
(4, 8): Node 4 and Node 9 share Node 8 -> Triangle <4, 8, 9>
(5, 7): No triangles formed as Node 5 and Node 2 or 8 have no shared connection.
(5, 8): No triangles formed as Node 5 and Node 2 or 8 have no shared connection.
(7, 8): No triangles formed as Node 7 and Node 2 or 8 have no shared connection.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8] with triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 9>.
