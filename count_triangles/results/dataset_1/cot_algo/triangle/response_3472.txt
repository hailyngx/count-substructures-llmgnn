Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections from least to most, the new vertex labels are as follows: 

Node 7: 0 edges
Node 1: 1 edge
Node 5: 1 edge
Node 9: 1 edge
Node 2: 2 edges
Node 6: 2 edges
Node 4: 3 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 0: 5 edges

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will check for triangles based on the sorted vertices. 

There are 4 triangles in this graph, which are: 

<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
