Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in non-decreasing order, we have:

Vertices: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 1, 3, 5, 0, 9

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (2, 5): No triangles found.
2. Edge (4, 7): No triangles found.
3. Edge (6, 9): No triangles found.
4. Edge (7, 1): No triangles found.
5. Edge (8, 3): No triangles found.
6. Edge (1, 0): No triangles found.
7. Edge (3, 0): Triangle found: <0, 3, 5>.
8. Edge (5, 0): No triangles found.
9. Edge (9, 0): No triangles found.

Total number of triangles: [1]

Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 5>
