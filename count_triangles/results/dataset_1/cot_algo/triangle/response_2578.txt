Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degree of connectivity, we get the following order: 
Node 7 < Node 9 < Node 2 < Node 1 < Node 8 < Node 4 < Node 3 < Node 6 < Node 5 < Node 0.

Following this ordering and considering the edges, we find the following triangles: 
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 5, 4>
4. <0, 5, 8>
5. <4, 2, 6>
6. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
