Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

In this case, the vertices and their degrees are:
- Vertex 9: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 5 connections
- Vertex 3: 5 connections

The new labels for the vertices based on their degrees will be:
- Vertex 9 (label 0)
- Vertex 2 (label 1)
- Vertex 5 (label 2)
- Vertex 6 (label 3)
- Vertex 8 (label 4)
- Vertex 7 (label 5)
- Vertex 0 (label 6)
- Vertex 1 (label 7)
- Vertex 4 (label 8)
- Vertex 3 (label 9)

Now, we go through the edges following the rule that we proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Analyzing the edges based on the new labels:
- Edge (2, 3) - Forms a triangle <2, 3, 8>
- Edge (2, 8) - Does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 3) - Forms a triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Edge (6, 0) - Does not form a triangle
- Edge (1, 3) - Does not form a triangle
- Edge (1, 4) - Forms a triangle <2, 4, 8>
- Edge (0, 6) - Does not form a triangle
- Edge (0, 7) - Does not form a triangle
- Edge (0, 8) - Forms a triangle <2, 8, 6>
- Edge (3, 1) - Does not form a triangle
- Edge (3, 2) - Forms a triangle <2, 3, 8>
- Edge (3, 5) - Forms a triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Edge (3, 7) - Forms a triangle <2, 3, 8>
- Edge (4, 1) - Does not form a triangle
- Edge (4, 5) - Forms a triangle <2, 4, 5>
- Edge (4, 6) - Forms a triangle <2, 4, 6>
- Edge (4, 8) - Forms a triangle <2, 4, 8>
- Edge (4, 9) - Does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 4) - Forms a triangle <2, 4, 5>

Counting the total number of triangles and listing the unique triangles found:
- Total number of triangles: [6]
- Unique triangles found: <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 8, 6>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>
