Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by the number of connections, we have the following new labels: 
Node 1 (degree 5), Node 3 (degree 3), Node 8 (degree 2), Node 4 (degree 3), Node 2 (degree 4), Node 9 (degree 4), Node 5 (degree 4), Node 6 (degree 6), Node 7 (degree 4), Node 0 (degree 7).

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge: 
- Edge (1, 0) forms a triangle with shared connections 0, 2, 4. 
- Edge (2, 0) forms a triangle with shared connections 0, 5, 6. 
- Edge (4, 0) forms a triangle with shared connections 0, 5, 9. 
- Edge (9, 4) forms a triangle with shared connections 4, 1, 6. 
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with shared connections 0, 2, 6. 
- Edge (5, 6) forms a triangle with shared connections 6, 1, 9. 
- Edge (6, 1) forms a triangle with shared connections 1, 3, 9. 
- Edge (6, 2) forms a triangle with shared connections 6, 0, 7. 
- Edge (6, 7) forms a triangle with shared connections 7, 0, 2. 
- Edge (6, 8) forms a triangle with shared connections 8, 0, 6. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <4, 1, 6>, <6, 1, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <6, 0, 7>, <7, 0, 2>, <8, 0, 6>.
