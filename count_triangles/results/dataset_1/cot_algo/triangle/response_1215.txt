Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertex 1 (degree 2): 1 connection
Vertex 3 (degree 2): 2 connections
Vertex 0 (degree 3): 3 connections
Vertex 2 (degree 3): 3 connections
Vertex 7 (degree 3): 3 connections
Vertex 8 (degree 3): 3 connections
Vertex 4 (degree 4): 4 connections
Vertex 5 (degree 4): 4 connections
Vertex 6 (degree 3): 3 connections
Vertex 9 (degree 4): 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertex 1 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 0
Vertex 3 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 1
Vertex 0 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 2
Vertex 2 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 3
Vertex 7 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 4
Vertex 8 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 5
Vertex 4 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 6
Vertex 5 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 7
Vertex 6 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 8
Vertex 9 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
