Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 6: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 5 connections
- Vertex 5: 6 connections

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles formed:
1. Edge (0, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 9. Triangle: <0, 5, 9>
2. Edge (0, 9): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (2, 8): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (3, 7): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (4, 5): Forms a triangle with vertices 7 and 9. Triangle: <4, 5, 7>
8. Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with vertices 6 and 9. Triangle: <4, 7, 6>
9. Edge (4, 9): Forms a triangle with vertices 5 and 0. Triangle: <4, 9, 5>
10. Edge (5, 0): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (5, 4): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (5, 8): Forms a triangle with vertices 4 and 7. Triangle: <5, 8, 4>
14. Edge (6, 5): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (6, 7): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (7, 3): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (7, 4): No triangle formed.
20. Edge (7, 6): No triangle formed.
21. Edge (7, 8): Forms a triangle with vertices 5 and 4. Triangle: <7, 8, 5>
22. Edge (8, 2): No triangle formed.
23. Edge (8, 3): No triangle formed.
24. Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed.
25. Edge (8, 7): No triangle formed.
26. Edge (8, 9): Forms a triangle with vertices 4 and 5. Triangle: <8, 9, 4>
27. Edge (9, 0): No triangle formed.
28. Edge (9, 4): No triangle formed.
29. Edge (9, 6): No triangle formed.
30. Edge (9, 8): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 6>, <5, 8, 4>.
