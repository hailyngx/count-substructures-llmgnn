Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, 8 have degree 3
- Nodes 6, 9 have degree 4
- Nodes 0, 3 have degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge. Starting from the edge with the lowest labeled vertex, we count the triangles that can be formed:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
