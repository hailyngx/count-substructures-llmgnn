Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). The sorted order of vertices in this graph is: 3, 6, 9, 1, 8, 4, 2, 7, 5, 0.

Using this sorted order, we can find the number of triangles in the graph by following the given instructions.

Number of triangles inside brackets []:
[10]

Unique triangles found inside <>:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
