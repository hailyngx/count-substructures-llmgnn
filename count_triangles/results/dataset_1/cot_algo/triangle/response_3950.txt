Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node Degrees:
0: 2
1: 2
2: 4
3: 2
4: 4
5: 4
6: 1
7: 3
8: 3
9: 2

Sorting by degrees:
6, 0, 1, 3, 9, 7, 8, 5, 4, 2

Edges to consider based on the sorting:
(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 7)

Now, let's count the triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
