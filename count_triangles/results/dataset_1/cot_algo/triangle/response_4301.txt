Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a sorted list of nodes based on their degree.

Node 3 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 1
Nodes 0, 2, and 8 have degree 2
Nodes 1, 5, and 7 have degree 4
Nodes 4 and 6 have degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 9 (degree 1) becomes node 0
Node 0 (degree 2) becomes node 1
Node 2 (degree 2) becomes node 2
Node 8 (degree 2) becomes node 3
Node 1 (degree 4) becomes node 4
Node 5 (degree 4) becomes node 5
Node 7 (degree 4) becomes node 6
Node 4 (degree 5) becomes node 7
Node 6 (degree 5) becomes node 8
Node 3 (degree 3) becomes node 9

Now, let's list the edges based on the new labels:
(1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 9) (9, 7)

Now, we count the triangles based on the shared connections:

Triangles: 8
[8] 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 0>
<3, 1, 7>
<5, 4, 7>
