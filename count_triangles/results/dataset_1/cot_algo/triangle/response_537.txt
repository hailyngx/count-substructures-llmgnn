Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

- Node 4: degree 0
- Nodes 1 and 3: degree 1
- Nodes 2 and 9: degree 2
- Nodes 5 and 8: degree 3
- Nodes 0, 6, and 7: degree 4

We will relabel the nodes as follows:
- Node 4 -> A
- Nodes 1 and 3 -> B
- Nodes 2 and 9 -> C
- Nodes 5 and 8 -> D
- Nodes 0, 6, and 7 -> E

Now, we will list the edges according to the new labels:
- (E, E), (E, E), (E, E)
- (B, D)
- (C, D), (C, D)
- (D, B), (D, B), (D, C), (D, E)
- (E, E), (E, E), (E, E), (E, B)
- (D, E), (D, C), (D, E)
- (E, E), (E, C), (E, E)

Now, we will count the triangles. There are 16 triangles in total:

[16]

The unique triangles are:
- <0, 6, 8>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 7, 2>
- <5, 7, 6>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <5, 7, 0>
- <5, 7, 6>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <5, 7, 0>
- <5, 7, 6>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <5, 7, 0>
