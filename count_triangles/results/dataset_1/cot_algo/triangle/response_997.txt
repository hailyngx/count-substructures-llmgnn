Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be as follows:
- Node 3 has 2 connections.
- Nodes 1, 7, and 2 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 4, 0, 5, and 8 have 4 connections each.
- Nodes 6 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph:

- For the edge (0, 1):
  - Node 0 has connections with nodes 2, 4, and 6.
  - Node 1 has connections with nodes 2 and 7.
  - The shared connection is with node 2, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.

- For the edge (0, 2):
  - Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 4, and 6.
  - Node 2 has connections with nodes 1 and 6.
  - The shared connection is with node 1, forming a triangle <0, 2, 1>.

- For the edge (0, 4):
  - Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 2, and 6.
  - Node 4 has connections with nodes 3 and 5.
  - There are no shared connections for a triangle.

- For the edge (0, 6):
  - Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 2, and 4.
  - Node 6 has connections with nodes 2, 7, and 8.
  - The shared connection is with node 2, forming a triangle <0, 6, 2>.

- For the edge (1, 2):
  - Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 7, and 2.
  - Node 2 has connections with nodes 0 and 6.
  - The shared connection is with node 0, forming a triangle <1, 2, 0>.

- For the edge (1, 7):
  - Node 1 has connections with nodes 0 and 2.
  - Node 7 has connections with nodes 6 and 8.
  - There are no shared connections for a triangle.

- For the edge (2, 6):
  - Node 2 has connections with nodes 0 and 1.
  - Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 7, and 8.
  - The shared connection is with node 0, forming a triangle <2, 6, 0>.

- The rest of the edges do not form triangles as the lower labeled vertex has more connections. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 6, 2>, <1, 2, 0>, and <2, 6, 0>.
