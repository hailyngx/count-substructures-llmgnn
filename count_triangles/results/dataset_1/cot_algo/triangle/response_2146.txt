Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the order is: 
Node 0: 1 connection  
Node 6: 1 connection  
Node 8: 1 connection  
Node 9: 2 connections  
Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 7: 5 connections  
Node 3: 5 connections  
Node 4: 5 connections  

Following the degree-based ordering, we consider the edges in the following sequence:
(0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 7), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 7), (5, 3), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 9), (9, 2), (9, 8).

By checking the shared connections between vertices connected by each edge, we find the triangles:
<1, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
