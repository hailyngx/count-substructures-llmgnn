Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices from least connected to most connected:

Vertices: 7, 0, 4, 2, 6, 5, 4, 1, 3, 9, 8
Degrees: 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5

Now, we will count the triangles based on the ordering:

1. Starting with edge (0, 3): Both 0 and 3 are connected to 5.
2. Moving to edge (0, 5): Both 0 and 5 are connected to 3.
3. Next, edge (1, 3): 1 is connected to 4 which is connected to 5 and to 9 which is connected to 3, forming a triangle <1, 4, 9>.
4. Moving on to edge (1, 4): No triangles formed here.
5. Edge (1, 8): No triangles.
6. Edge (1, 9): No triangles.
7. Edge (2, 5): Both 2 and 5 are connected to 0.
8. Edge (2, 8): No triangles.
9. Edge (3, 0): Already counted.
10. Edge (3, 1): Already counted.
11. Edge (3, 5): Already counted.
12. Edge (3, 9): Already counted.
13. Edge (4, 1): Already checked.
14. Edge (4, 5): Already counted.
15. Edge (5, 0): Already counted.
16. Edge (5, 2): Already counted.
17. Edge (5, 3): Already counted.
18. Edge (5, 4): Already counted.
19. Edge (7, 8): No triangles.
20. Edge (7, 9): No triangles.
21. Edge (8, 1): Already checked.
22. Edge (8, 2): Already checked.
23. Edge (8, 7): No triangles.
24. Edge (8, 9): Already counted.
25. Edge (9, 1): Already checked.
26. Edge (9, 3): Already counted.
27. Edge (9, 7): No triangles.
