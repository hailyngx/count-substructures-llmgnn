Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new vertex labels are as follows:
1 ⟶ 2 connections
2 ⟶ 2 connections
4 ⟶ 1 connection
9 ⟶ 2 connections
5 ⟶ 2 connections
8 ⟶ 3 connections
7 ⟶ 4 connections
3 ⟶ 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider edges only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- (1, 3) forms the triangle <1, 3, 7>.
- (1, 7) forms the triangle <1, 3, 7>.
- (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
- (3, 8) forms the triangle <3, 5, 8>.
- (4, 7) forms the triangle <4, 7, 8>.
- (5, 8) forms the triangle <3, 5, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
