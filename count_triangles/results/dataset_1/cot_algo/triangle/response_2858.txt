Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Node 0 has 1 connection  
Node 3 has 0 connections  
Node 7 has 1 connection  
Node 4 has 1 connection  
Node 6 has 1 connection  
Node 5 has 1 connection  
Node 1 has 2 connections  
Node 2 has 3 connections  
Node 8 has 5 connections  
Node 9 has 5 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  

Considering the given edges, we find the following triangles:  
<1, 0, 2>  
<1, 8, 2>  
<1, 8, 4>  
<1, 8, 7>  
<1, 8, 9>  
<1, 2, 9>  
<1, 8, 9>  
<2, 9, 8>  
<4, 8, 7>  
<8, 9, 4>  
<8, 9, 5>  
<8, 9, 6>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
