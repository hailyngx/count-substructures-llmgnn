Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by number of connections are: 

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 1: 8 connections
Node 5: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will proceed with the edges in the following order:

(3, 5), (7, 4), (9, 5), (2, 8), (6, 1), (8, 1), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 8), (4, 7), (4, 1), (5, 9), (5, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (0, 5), (8, 2), (6, 2), (1, 5), (2, 6), (1, 4), (1, 0), (0, 1)

By examining the shared connections for each edge, we find the following triangles:
<1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 5, 0>, <1, 5, 9>, <5, 3, 9>, <5, 3, 0>, <0, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
