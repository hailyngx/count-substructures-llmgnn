Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Relabeling the nodes accordingly:
Node 5 (0 connections) -> Node 0
Node 0 (1 connection) -> Node 1
Node 4 (1 connection) -> Node 2
Node 9 (1 connection) -> Node 3
Node 1 (2 connections) -> Node 4
Node 2 (3 connections) -> Node 5
Node 6 (4 connections) -> Node 6
Node 8 (4 connections) -> Node 7
Node 7 (4 connections) -> Node 8
Node 3 (5 connections) -> Node 9

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 7) - Proceed: Node 0 is lower, check for shared connections.
   Shared connections: None

2. Edge (1, 2) - Skip: Both nodes have the same number of connections.

3. Edge (1, 6) - Proceed: Node 1 is lower, check for shared connections.
   Shared connections: None

4. Edge (2, 1) - Skip: Both nodes have the same number of connections.

5. Edge (2, 6) - Proceed: Node 2 is lower, check for shared connections.
   Shared connections: None

6. Edge (3, 7) - Proceed: Node 3 is lower, check for shared connections.
   Shared connections: None

7. Edge (3, 8) - Proceed: Node 3 is lower, check for shared connections.
   Shared connections: Node 6

8. Edge (3, 9) - Skip: Node 3 has more connections than Node 9.

9. Edge (4, 8) - Proceed: Node 4 is lower, check for shared connections.
   Shared connections: None

10. Edge (6, 1) - Skip: Node 6 has more connections than Node 1.

11. Edge (6, 2) - Skip: Node 6 has more connections than Node 2.

12. Edge (6, 8) - Proceed: Node 6 is lower, check for shared connections.
   Shared connections: None

13. Edge (7, 0) - Proceed: Node 0 is lower, check for shared connections.
   Shared connections: None

14. Edge (7, 3) - Skip: Node 7 has more connections than Node 3.

15. Edge (8, 3) - Skip: Node 8 has more connections than Node 3.

16. Edge (8, 4) - Skip: Node 8 has more connections than Node 4.

17. Edge (8, 6) - Proceed: Node 6 is lower, check for shared connections.
   Shared connections: None

18. Edge (9, 3) - Skip: Node 9 has more connections than Node 3.
