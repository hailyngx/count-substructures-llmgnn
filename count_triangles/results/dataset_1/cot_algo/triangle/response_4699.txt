Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following order: 

- Node 3: Degree 1
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 9: Degree 2
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 6
- Node 2: Degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we have the following triangles: 

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <1, 4, 5>
6. <1, 4, 6>
7. <2, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
