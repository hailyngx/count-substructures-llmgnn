Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Now, we'll relabel the vertices:

0 -> 0 (degree 1)
6 -> 1 (degree 1)
7 -> 2 (degree 2)
9 -> 3 (degree 2)
5 -> 4 (degree 3)
1 -> 5 (degree 4)
8 -> 6 (degree 3)
4 -> 7 (degree 4)
2 -> 8 (degree 5)

Next, we'll iterate through the edges in increasing order of the lower-labelled vertex to count triangles:

Triangles: [<1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 8>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
