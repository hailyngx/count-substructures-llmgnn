Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Node 0 -> degree 2
Node 1 -> degree 1
Node 2 -> degree 4
Node 3 -> degree 2
Node 4 -> degree 4
Node 5 -> degree 4
Node 6 -> degree 1
Node 7 -> degree 5
Node 8 -> degree 3
Node 9 -> degree 2

Next, we will relabel the nodes in increasing order of degree:

Node 1 -> degree 1
Node 6 -> degree 1
Node 0 -> degree 2
Node 3 -> degree 2
Node 9 -> degree 2
Node 8 -> degree 3
Node 2 -> degree 4
Node 4 -> degree 4
Node 5 -> degree 4
Node 7 -> degree 5

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph and count the triangles:

- (0, 3) forms a triangle with node 5: <0, 3, 5>
- (0, 5) forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 7: <0, 5, 2>; <0, 5, 7>
- (1, 4) does not form a triangle
- (2, 4) forms a triangle with node 7: <2, 4, 7>
- (2, 5) forms a triangle with node 0 and 7: <2, 5, 0>; <2, 5, 7>
- (2, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 4, and 5: <2, 7, 0>; <2, 7, 4>; <2, 7, 5>
- (3, 0) forms a triangle with node 5: <3, 0, 5>
- (3, 8) does not form a triangle
- (4, 1) does not form a triangle
- (4, 2) forms a triangle with node 7: <4, 2, 7>
- (4, 5) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7: <4, 5, 0>; <4, 5, 7>
- (4, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 2, and 5: <4, 7, 0>; <4, 7, 2>; <4, 7, 5>
- (5, 0) forms a triangle with node 2: <5, 0, 2>
- (5, 2) forms a triangle with node 7: <5, 2, 7>
- (5, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7: <5, 4, 0>; <5, 4, 7>
- (5, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 2, and 4: <5, 7, 0>; <5, 7, 2>; <5, 7, 4>
- (6, 9) does not form a triangle
- (7, 2) forms a triangle with node 5: <7, 2, 5>
- (7, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5: <7, 4, 0>; <7, 4, 5>
- (7, 5) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 2, and 4: <7, 5, 0>; <7, 5, 2>; <7, 5, 4>
- (7, 8) does not form a triangle
- (8, 3) does not form a triangle
- (8, 7) does not form a triangle
- (8, 9) does not form a triangle
- (9, 6) does not form a triangle
- (9, 8) does not form a triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 22, and the unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 0>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 5>
<3, 0, 5>
<4, 2, 7>
<4, 5, 0>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 0>
<4, 7, 2>
<4, 7, 5>
<5, 0, 2>
<5, 2, 7>
<5, 4, 0>
<5, 4, 7>
<5, 7, 0>
<5, 7, 2>
<5, 7, 4>
