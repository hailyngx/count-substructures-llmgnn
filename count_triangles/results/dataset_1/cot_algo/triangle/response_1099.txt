Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of vertices is as follows:
- Node 5: 0 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check the edges in the order specified:
1. Edge (0, 4): Forms triangles with node 6 and node 8. <0, 4, 6> is a triangle.
2. Edge (0, 6): No triangles formed since both nodes 0 and 6 have 3 connections.
3. Edge (0, 8): Forms a triangle with node 4. <0, 4, 8> is a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 4): No triangles formed since both nodes 1 and 4 have 1 connection.
5. Edge (2, 7): No triangles formed since both nodes 2 and 7 have 2 connections.
6. Edge (2, 9): No triangles formed since both nodes 2 and 9 have 2 connections.
7. Edge (3, 8): No triangles formed since both nodes 3 and 8 have 2 connections.
8. Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed since both nodes 3 and 9 have 2 connections.
9. Edge (4, 0): Already considered.
10. Edge (4, 1): Already considered.
11. Edge (4, 6): Already considered.
12. Edge (4, 8): Already considered.
13. Edge (6, 0): Already considered.
14. Edge (6, 4): Already considered.
15. Edge (6, 7): Forms a triangle with node 2. <2, 6, 7> is a triangle.
16. Edge (7, 2): Already considered.
17. Edge (7, 6): Already considered.
18. Edge (8, 0): Already considered.
19. Edge (8, 3): No triangles formed since both nodes 3 and 8 have 2 connections.
20. Edge (8, 4): Already considered.
21. Edge (9, 2): No triangles formed since both nodes 2 and 9 have 2 connections.
22. Edge (9, 3): No triangles formed since both nodes 3 and 9 have 2 connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
