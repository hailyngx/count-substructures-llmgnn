Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degree.

The degrees of each vertex are as follows:
0: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 1 connection
6: 1 connection
8: 3 connections
9: 3 connections

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degree:
5, 6, 0, 2
9, 8, 4

Next, we check the edges one by one:
- Edge (0, 8) is valid since 0 < 8 and both are adjacent to vertex 4. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>.
- Edge (2, 5) is valid since 2 < 5 and they are not connected through any common vertices.
- Edge (4, 8) is valid since 4 < 8 and they are connected to vertex 0. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>.
- Edge (4, 9) is valid since 4 < 9 and they are adjacent to vertex 6. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 9>.
- Edge (5, 2) is valid since 2 < 5 and they are not connected through any common vertices.
- Edge (6, 9) is valid since 6 < 9 and they are not connected through any common vertices.
- Edge (8, 0) is NOT valid since 8 > 0.
- Edge (8, 4) is valid since 4 < 8 and they are connected to vertex 0. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>.
- Edge (9, 4) is valid since 4 < 9 and they are adjacent to vertex 6. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 9>.
- Edge (9, 6) is valid since 6 < 9 and they are not connected through any common vertices.
