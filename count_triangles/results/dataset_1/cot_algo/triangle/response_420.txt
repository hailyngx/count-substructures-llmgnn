Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices will be relabeled as follows:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 8: 7 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections

Now, we will examine each edge while considering the lower labeled vertex:
- Edge (0, 5): Forms a triangle with node 8 <0, 5, 8>
- Edge (0, 8): No additional triangles
- Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 4): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 6): Forms a triangle with node 8 <3, 6, 8>
- Edge (3, 8): Forms a triangle with node 6 <3, 6, 8>
- Edge (4, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle with node 8 <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (5, 7): No additional triangles
- Edge (6, 3): Forms a triangle with node 8 <3, 6, 8>
- Edge (6, 4): Forms a triangle with node 8 <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (6, 8): No additional triangles
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 5): No additional triangles
- Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 0): No additional triangles
- Edge (8, 1): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 3): No additional triangles
- Edge (8, 6): No additional triangles
- Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, and <4, 6, 8>.
