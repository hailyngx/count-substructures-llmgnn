Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
1. 0 (degree 4)
2. 2 (degree 4)
3. 4 (degree 3)
4. 3 (degree 3)
5. 5 (degree 2)
6. 1 (degree 2)
7. 6 (degree 2)
8. 8 (degree 1)
9. 9 (degree 1)

Now, we will go through each edge starting from the one with the lowest label to find triangles:

- Edge (0, 2):
    - 0 is connected to 3, 4, and 5
    - 2 is connected to 1, 8, and 9
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (0, 3):
    - 0 is connected to 2, 4, and 5
    - 3 is connected to 4 and 6
    - Shared connection: 4
    - Triangle: <0, 3, 4>
- Edge (0, 4):
    - 0 is connected to 2, 3, and 5
    - 4 is connected to 3 and 5
    - Shared connection: 5
    - Triangle: <0, 4, 5>
- Edge (0, 5):
    - 0 is connected to 2, 3, and 4
    - 5 is connected to 4
    - Shared connection: 4
    - Triangle: <0, 4, 5>
- Edge (1, 2):
    - 1 is connected to 6
    - 2 is connected to 0, 1, 8, and 9
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 6):
    - 1 is connected to 2
    - 6 is connected to 3
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 8):
    - 2 is connected to 0, 1, and 9
    - 8 is connected to None
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 9):
    - 2 is connected to 0, 1, and 8
    - 9 is connected to None
    - Shared connections: None
Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>
