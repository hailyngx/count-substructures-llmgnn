Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
By arranging the vertices based on their degrees in non-decreasing order, we have the following labeling: 
Node 1 (degree 2): 1 
Node 7 (degree 2): 2 
Node 5 (degree 3): 3 
Node 2 (degree 3): 4 
Node 8 (degree 3): 5 
Node 3 (degree 3): 6 
Node 4 (degree 4): 7 
Node 9 (degree 4): 8 
Node 6 (degree 5): 9 
Node 0 (degree 6): 10

Now, we will list the triangles based on shared connections between edges:
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
