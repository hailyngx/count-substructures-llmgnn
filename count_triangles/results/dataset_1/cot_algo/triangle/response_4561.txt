Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted vertices in this graph are:  

Node 7: 0 connections  
Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 6: 4 connections  
Node 8: 7 connections  
Node 4: 8 connections  
Node 0: 8 connections  
Node 9: 9 connections  

Using this order, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph by considering each edge:

- Edge (0, 4): forms triangle with nodes 6 and 8; <0, 4, 6>
- Edge (0, 6): does not form a triangle
- Edge (0, 9): forms triangle with nodes 3 and 5; <0, 9, 3>
- Edge (1, 8): does not form a triangle
- Edge (1, 9): does not form a triangle
- Edge (2, 6): does not form a triangle
- Edge (2, 8): forms triangle with nodes 9 and 5; <2, 8, 9>
- Edge (3, 5): does not form a triangle
- Edge (3, 8): does not form a triangle
- Edge (3, 9): does not form a triangle
- Edge (4, 0): forms triangle with nodes 6 and 8; <0, 4, 6>
- Edge (4, 6): forms triangle with nodes 0 and 8; <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (4, 7): does not form a triangle
- Edge (4, 8): forms triangle with nodes 0 and 6; <4, 8, 0>
- Edge (5, 3): does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 8): does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 9): does not form a triangle
- Edge (6, 0): does not form a triangle
- Edge (6, 2): does not form a triangle
- Edge (6, 4): forms triangle with nodes 0 and 8; <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (6, 8): forms triangle with nodes 0 and 4; <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (7, 4): does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 1): does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 2): forms triangle with nodes 9 and 5; <2, 8, 9>
- Edge (8, 3): does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 4): forms triangle with nodes 0 and 6; <4, 8, 0>
- Edge (8, 5): does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 6): forms triangle with nodes 0 and 4; <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (8, 9): does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 0): forms triangle with nodes 3 and 5; <0, 9, 3>
- Edge (9, 1): does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 3): does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 5): does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 8): does not form a triangle

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <0, 9, 3>, <2, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 0>, <0, 9, 3>.
