Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we have the following order: 
Vertex 2 has 2 connections. 
Vertex 5 has 2 connections. 
Vertex 6 has 2 connections. 
Vertex 3 has 3 connections. 
Vertex 1 has 3 connections. 
Vertex 0 has 4 connections. 
Vertex 7 has 4 connections. 
Vertex 8 has 4 connections. 
Vertex 4 has 5 connections. 
Vertex 9 has 7 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges:

1. Edge (0, 1): Both vertices are connected to vertex 9. Hence, a triangle <0, 1, 9> is formed.
2. Edge (0, 4): Vertices 0 and 4 share vertex 9. So, a triangle <0, 4, 9> is formed.
3. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 and 9 share connections with 1 and 4. Thus, a triangle <0, 1, 9> is formed.
4. Edge (1, 9): Both vertices have a direct connection as well as connections with 0 and 4, forming the same triangle <0, 1, 9>.
5. Edge (2, 3): No triangle is formed as both vertices have different neighbors.
6. Edge (2, 7): No triangle is formed as both vertices have different neighbors.
7. Edge (3, 8): No triangle is formed as both vertices have different neighbors.
8. Edge (4, 7): Both vertices are connected to vertex 9, forming a triangle <4, 7, 9>.
9. Edge (4, 9): Already counted in previous steps.
10. Edge (5, 7): No triangle is formed as both vertices have different neighbors.
11. Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 and 9 share connections with 4, forming a triangle <4, 5, 9>.
12. Edge (6, 8): No triangle is formed as both vertices have different neighbors.
13. Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 and 9 share connections with 8, forming a triangle <6, 8, 9>.
14. Edge (7, 2): No triangle is formed as both vertices have different neighbors.
15. Edge (7, 4): Already counted in previous steps.
16. Edge (7, 5): Already counted in previous steps.
17. Edge (8, 3): No triangle is formed as both vertices have different neighbors.
18. Edge (8, 6): Already counted in previous steps.
19. Edge (8, 9): Already counted in previous steps.
20. Edge (9, 0): Already counted in previous steps.
21. Edge (9, 1): Already counted in previous steps.
22. Edge (9, 4): Already counted in previous steps.
23. Edge (9, 5): Already counted in previous steps.
24. Edge (9, 6): Already counted in previous steps.
25. Edge (9, 8): Already counted in previous steps.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] including the unique triangles <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>.
