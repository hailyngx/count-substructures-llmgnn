Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new order is: <6, 4, 1, 3, 8, 5, 0, 7, 2, 9>. 

Using this ordering, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <2, 8, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <5, 8, 9>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
