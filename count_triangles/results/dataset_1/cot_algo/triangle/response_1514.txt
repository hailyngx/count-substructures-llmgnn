Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  

Vertex 6: Connected to 1 neighbor  
Vertex 8: Connected to 1 neighbor  
Vertex 7: Connected to 3 neighbors  
Vertex 0: Connected to 4 neighbors  
Vertex 9: Connected to 4 neighbors  
Vertex 1: Connected to 5 neighbors  
Vertex 3: Connected to 5 neighbors  
Vertex 4: Connected to 6 neighbors  
Vertex 2: Connected to 6 neighbors  
Vertex 5: Connected to 8 neighbors  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the triangles:

1. (1, 2): Shared connections: (4, 7)  
2. (1, 4): Shared connections: (3, 7)  
3. (1, 7): Shared connections: (3, 4)  

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:  
<1, 2, 4>
