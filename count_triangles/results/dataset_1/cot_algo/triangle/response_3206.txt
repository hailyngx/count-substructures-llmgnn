Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
- Node 0 has 1 connection
- Node 1 has 4 connections
- Node 2 has 3 connections
- Node 3 has 3 connections
- Node 4 has 3 connections
- Node 5 has 4 connections
- Node 6 has 3 connections
- Node 7 has 3 connections
- Node 8 has 2 connections
- Node 9 has 2 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <0, 5, 2>
- Edge (1, 2) does not form a triangle as the conditions are not met.
- Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <1, 6, 3>
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <1, 7, 3>
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle as the conditions are not met.
- Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle as the conditions are not met.
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <3, 4, 9>
- Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle as the conditions are not met.
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle as the conditions are not met.
- Edge (6, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <6, 1, 7>
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle as the conditions are not met.
- Edge (7, 1) does not form a triangle as the conditions are not met.
- Edge (7, 3) does not form a triangle as the conditions are not met.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 2>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 7, 3>, and <3, 4, 9>.
