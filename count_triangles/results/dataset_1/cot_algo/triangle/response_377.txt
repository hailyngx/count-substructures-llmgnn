Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices will be: 

Node 2: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 0: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now examine the edges in the graph to count the number of triangles:

1. (0, 1):
   - Node 0 (7 connections) has more connections than Node 1 (2 connections), continue.
   
2. (0, 3):
   - Node 0 (7 connections) has more connections than Node 3 (5 connections), continue.
   
3. (0, 5):
   - Node 0 (7 connections) has more connections than Node 5 (4 connections), continue.
   
4. (0, 6):
   - Node 0 (7 connections) has more connections than Node 6 (2 connections), continue.
   
5. (0, 7):
   - Node 0 (7 connections) is in the same situation as Node 7 (4 connections), so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 1, 3
   - Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
   
6. (0, 9):
   - Node 0 (7 connections) is in the same situation as Node 9 (3 connections), so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: 1
   - Triangle: <0, 1, 9>
   
7. (1, 7):
   - Node 1 (2 connections) has fewer connections than Node 7 (4 connections), continue.
   
8. (1, 9):
   - Node 1 (2 connections) is the lower label, continue.
   
9. (3, 2):
   - Node 3 (5 connections) has more connections than Node 2 (1 connection), continue.
   
10. (3, 4):
    - Node 3 (5 connections) is in the same situation as Node 4 (1 connection), so we proceed.
    - Shared connections: None
   
11. (3, 7):
    - Node 3 (5 connections) has more connections than Node 7 (4 connections), continue.
   
12. (5, 6):
    - Node 5 (4 connections) has more connections than Node 6 (2 connections), continue.
    
13. (5, 8):
    - Node 5 (4 connections) has more connections than Node 8 (1 connection), continue.
    
14. (5, 9):
    - Node 5 (4 connections) is the lower label, continue.
   
15. (7, 1):
    - Node 7 (4 connections) has more connections than Node 1 (2 connections), continue.
    
16. (7, 3):
    - Node 7 (4 connections) has more connections than Node 3 (5 connections), continue.
    
17. (9, 1):
    - Node 9 (3 connections) is in the same situation as Node 1 (2 connections), so we proceed.
    - Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>
