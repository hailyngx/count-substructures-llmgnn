Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 0 connections
Vertex 8: 0 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 7 connections
Vertex 6: 7 connections
Vertex 9: 7 connections

Now, we go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

Edge (0, 2):
Both vertices have fewer connections than their counterpart, so we proceed. Looking at shared connections, we find a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 2, 5>.

Edge (0, 5):
Both vertices have fewer connections than their counterpart, so we proceed. Looking at shared connections, we find a triangle with vertex 1: <0, 5, 1>.

Edge (1, 2):
Vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 2, so we skip this edge.

Edge (1, 3):
Both vertices have fewer connections than their counterpart, so we proceed. Looking at shared connections, we find a triangle with vertex 6: <1, 3, 6>.

Edge (1, 5):
Both vertices have fewer connections than their counterpart, so we proceed. Looking at shared connections, we find a triangle with vertex 9: <1, 5, 9>.

Edge (1, 6):
Vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 6, so we skip this edge.

Edge (1, 7):
Vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 7, so we skip this edge.

Edge (1, 9):
Vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 9, so we skip this edge.

Edge (3, 6):
Vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 6, so we skip this edge.

Edge (3, 9):
Vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 9, so we skip this edge.

Edge (5, 9):
Vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 9, so we skip this edge.

Count of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 1>, <1, 5, 9>.
