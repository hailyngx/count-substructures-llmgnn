Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 1, 9, 8, 6, 5, 2, 4, 7, 0, 3

Now, we will go through each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. Edge: (1, 2)
   Since vertex 1 has fewer connections, we will check for shared connections:
   Shared connections: None 

2. Edge: (1, 9)
   Shared connections: None

3. Edge: (2, 1)
   Shared connections: None

4. Edge: (2, 7)
   Shared connections: None

5. Edge: (3, 0)
   Shared connections: 7

6. Edge: (3, 4)
   Shared connections: 7, 5, 6

7. Edge: (3, 5)
   Shared connections: 4, 6

8. Edge: (3, 6)
   We have a triangle formed with vertices 4, 5, and 6.
   Shared connections: None

9. Edge: (3, 8)
   Shared connections: None

10. Edge: (3, 9)
    Shared connections: None

11. Edge: (4, 3)
    Shared connections: 5, 6

12. Edge: (4, 5)
    Shared connections: 3, 6

13. Edge: (4, 6)
    Shared connections: 3, 5

14. Edge: (5, 3)
    Shared connections: 4, 6

15. Edge: (5, 4)
    Shared connections: 3, 6

16. Edge: (5, 9)
    Shared connections: None

17. Edge: (6, 3)
    Shared connections: None

18. Edge: (6, 4)
    Shared connections: None

19. Edge: (6, 7)
    Shared connections: None

20. Edge: (7, 0)
    Shared connections: 3

21. Edge: (7, 2)
    Shared connection: None

22. Edge: (7, 4)
    Shared connections: 3

23. Edge: (7, 6)
    Shared connections: None

24. Edge: (8, 0)
    Shared connections: None

25. Edge: (8, 3)
    Shared connections: None

26. Edge: (9, 1)
    Shared connections: None

27. Edge: (9, 3)
    Shared connections: None

28. Edge: (9, 5)
    Shared connections: None

The total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <4, 3, 6>.
