Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 1
- Node 5: Degree 1
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 5
- Node 2: Degree 5

Now, we'll relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0: Degree 2 -> Label 0
- Node 1: Degree 3 -> Label 1
- Node 3: Degree 1 -> Label 2
- Node 5: Degree 1 -> Label 3
- Node 8: Degree 3 -> Label 4
- Node 4: Degree 4 -> Label 5
- Node 6: Degree 4 -> Label 6
- Node 9: Degree 3 -> Label 7
- Node 7: Degree 5 -> Label 8
- Node 2: Degree 5 -> Label 9

Now, let's list the edges with the lower labeled node first:
- (0, 2)
- (0, 7)
- (1, 2)
- (1, 6)
- (1, 9)
- (2, 6)
- (2, 9)
- (3, 4)
- (4, 7)
- (4, 8)
- (5, 7)
- (6, 7)
- (6, 8)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 7>
- Triangle 3: <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle 4: <1, 2, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle 6: <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle 7: <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle 8: <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle 9: <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
