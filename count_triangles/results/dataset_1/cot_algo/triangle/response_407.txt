Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices sorted by degree:
```
1. 9 (degree: 2)
2. 5 (degree: 2)
3. 2 (degree: 2)
4. 4 (degree: 2)
5. 6 (degree: 3)
6. 1 (degree: 3)
7. 5 (degree: 3)
8. 0 (degree: 4)
9. 7 (degree: 6)
10. 3 (degree: 4)
```

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 4) - Vertex 0 and Vertex 4 are connected. Their shared connections are Vertex 7. Therefore, triangle <0, 4, 7> is formed.
2. Edge (0, 6) - Vertex 0 and Vertex 6 are connected. Their shared connections are Vertex 7. Therefore, triangle <0, 6, 7> is formed.
3. Edge (0, 7) - Vertex 0 and Vertex 7 are connected. Their shared connections are Vertex 1, 3, 4, 6. Therefore, triangles <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 4>, and <0, 7, 6> are formed.
4. Edge (1, 3) - Vertex 1 and Vertex 3 are connected. Their shared connections are Vertex 7. Therefore, triangle <1, 3, 7> is formed.
5. Edge (1, 7) - Vertex 1 and Vertex 7 are connected. Their shared connections are Vertex 0 and 3. Therefore, triangles <1, 7, 0> and <1, 7, 3> are formed.
6. Edge (2, 7) - Vertex 2 and Vertex 7 are connected. Their shared connections are Vertex 0 and 3. Therefore, triangles <2, 7, 0> and <2, 7, 3> are formed.
7. Edge (3, 5) - Vertex 3 and Vertex 5 are connected. Their shared connections are Vertex 1. Therefore, triangle <3, 5, 1> is formed.
8. Edge (3, 7) - Vertex 3 and Vertex 7 are connected. Their shared connections are Vertex 0, 1, 2. Therefore, triangles <3, 7, 0>, <3, 7, 1>, and <3, 7, 2> are formed.
9. Edge (6, 9) - Vertex 6 and Vertex 9 are connected. Their shared connections are Vertex 0. Therefore, triangle <6, 9, 0> is formed.

Total number of triangles: [16]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 7, 3>, <2, 7, 0>, <2, 7, 3>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 7, 0>, <3, 7, 1>, <3, 7, 2>, <6, 9, 0>
