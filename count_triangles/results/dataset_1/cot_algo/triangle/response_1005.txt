Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 1 connection
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 3 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

- Vertex 1 (Degree 1) -> New Label: 0
- Vertex 5 (Degree 1) -> New Label: 1
- Vertex 7 (Degree 1) -> New Label: 2
- Vertex 8 (Degree 1) -> New Label: 3
- Vertex 0 (Degree 2) -> New Label: 4
- Vertex 2 (Degree 2) -> New Label: 5
- Vertex 4 (Degree 3) -> New Label: 6
- Vertex 6 (Degree 3) -> New Label: 7
- Vertex 9 (Degree 3) -> New Label: 8
- Vertex 3 (Degree 4) -> New Label: 9

Next, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Vertex 0 (4) and Vertex 4 (6) share connections 3 and 6 -> Triangle: <0, 4, 6>
- Vertex 0 (4) and Vertex 6 (7) share connection 6 -> Triangle: <0, 4, 6>
- Vertex 4 (6) and Vertex 9 (8) share connection 4 -> Triangle: <0, 4, 9>
- Vertex 6 (7) and Vertex 9 (8) share connection 6 -> Triangle: <0, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
