Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 0 -> degree 2
Node 1 -> degree 3
Node 2 -> degree 3
Node 3 -> degree 4
Node 4 -> degree 5
Node 5 -> degree 2
Node 6 -> degree 3
Node 7 -> degree 4
Node 8 -> degree 8
Node 9 -> degree 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles: 
[15 triangles]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
