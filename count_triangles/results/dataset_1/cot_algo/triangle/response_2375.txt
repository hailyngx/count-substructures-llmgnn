Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling will be: 
Nodes with the number of connections - (0), 1 (6), 2 (5), 3 (5), 4 (3), 5 (2), 6 (1), 7 (5), 8 (4), 9 (4).

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
