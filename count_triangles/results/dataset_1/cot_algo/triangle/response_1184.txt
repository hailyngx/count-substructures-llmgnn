Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0: degree 1
- Vertex 1: degree 1
- Vertex 6: degree 1
- Vertex 9: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 0
- Vertex 3: degree 0
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 5
- Vertex 4: degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and the given edges, we can find the triangles in the graph:

1. For edge (0, 5): <0, 5, 2>
2. For edge (1, 4): No triangles formed.
3. For edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.
4. For edge (2, 8): <2, 8, 4>
5. For edge (2, 9): No triangles formed.
6. For edge (4, 1): No triangles formed.
7. For edge (4, 5): <4, 5, 2>
8. For edge (4, 6): <4, 6, 9>
9. For edge (4, 8): <4, 8, 2>
10. For edge (5, 0): <5, 0, 2>
11. For edge (5, 2): <5, 2, 8>
12. For edge (5, 4): <5, 4, 8>
13. For edge (6, 4): <6, 4, 8>
14. For edge (6, 9): <6, 9, 2>
15. For edge (8, 2): <8, 2, 5>
16. For edge (8, 4): <8, 4, 6>
17. For edge (9, 2): <9, 2, 5>
18. For edge (9, 6): <9, 6, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
