Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly. The sorted vertices are: 

Vertices: 7, 9, 1, 5, 3, 4, 0, 8, 2

After relabeling, the edges that meet the condition "proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections" are: 

(0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8)

For each edge, we will check for shared connections to find triangles: 

- Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with vertex 2 shared, yielding triangle <0, 2, x>.
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with vertex 4 shared, yielding triangle <0, 4, x>.
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 7 shared, yielding triangle <0, 7, x>.
- Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with vertex 2 shared, yielding triangle <1, 2, x>.
- Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 5 shared, yielding triangle <1, 5, x>.
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 7 shared, yielding triangle <1, 7, x>.
- Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 8 shared, yielding triangle <2, 8, x>.
- Edge (2, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 9 shared, yielding triangle <2, 9, x>.
- Edge (3, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 7 shared, yielding triangle <3, 7, x>.
- Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 8 shared, yielding triangle <3, 8, x>.
- Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 9 shared, yielding triangle <3, 9, x>.
- Edge (4, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 5 shared, yielding triangle <4, 5, x>.
- Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 7 shared, yielding triangle <4, 7, x>.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle as vertex 8 has more connections.
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle as vertex 8 has more connections.
