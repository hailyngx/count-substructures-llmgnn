Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 6: 0 connections
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 0: 8 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

1. (6, 9) does not form any triangle.
2. (6, 5) does not form any triangle.
3. (6, 8) does not form any triangle.
4. (6, 7) does not form any triangle.
5. (9, 0) does not form any triangle.
6. (9, 1) does not form any triangle.
7. (5, 2) does not form any triangle.
8. (5, 4) forms a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
9. (5, 6) does not form any triangle.
10. (8, 3) does not form any triangle.
11. (8, 4) forms a triangle <3, 4, 8>.
12. (8, 7) forms a triangle <4, 7, 8>.
13. (3, 1) does not form any triangle.
14. (3, 4) forms a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
15. (3, 7) forms a triangle <3, 4, 7>.
16. (1, 0) does not form any triangle.
17. (1, 9) does not form any triangle.
18. (1, 4) forms a triangle <1, 4, 9>.
19. (2, 0) does not form any triangle.
20. (2, 4) forms a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
21. (2, 5) forms a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
22. (2, 7) forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
23. (4, 1) does not form any triangle.
24. (4, 2) does not form any triangle.
25. (4, 3) forms a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
26. (4, 5) forms a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
27. (4, 7) forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
28. (4, 8) forms a triangle <3, 4, 8>.
29. (7, 0) does not form any triangle.
30. (7, 2) forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
31. (7, 3) forms a triangle <3, 4, 7>.
32. (7, 4) forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
33. (7, 5) forms a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
34. (7, 8) forms a triangle <4, 7, 8>.

Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 7, 8>.
