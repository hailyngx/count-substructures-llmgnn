Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 0
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 8: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 1

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degrees and start counting triangles:
Vertex 1: degree 0
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 1
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 4

Counting triangles:
- Edge (0, 4) forms triangle with shared connection 5. Triangle <0, 4, 5>.
- Edge (0, 5) forms triangle with shared connection 4. Triangle <0, 5, 4>.
- Edge (0, 7) forms triangle with shared connection 8. Triangle <0, 7, 8>.
- Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 8) forms triangle with shared connection 5. Triangle <2, 8, 5>.
- Edge (3, 6) forms triangle with shared connection 2. Triangle <3, 6, 2>.
- Edge (4, 0) forms triangle with shared connection 5. Triangle <4, 0, 5>.
- Edge (5, 0) forms triangle with shared connection 4. Triangle <5, 0, 4>.
- Edge (5, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 8) forms triangle with shared connection 0. Triangle <5, 8, 0>.
- Edge (6, 2) forms triangle with shared connection 3. Triangle <6, 2, 3>.
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 8) forms triangle with shared connection 5. Triangle <6, 8, 5>.
- Edge (7, 0) forms triangle with shared connection 8. Triangle <7, 0, 8>.
- Edge (7, 8) forms triangle with shared connection 5. Triangle <7, 8, 5>.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 7, 8>, <2, 8, 5>, <3, 6, 2>, <4, 0, 5>, <5, 0, 4>, <5, 8, 0>, <6, 8, 5>.
