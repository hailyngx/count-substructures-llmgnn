Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections: 

Node 7 has 0 connections.
Nodes 0, 3, and 7 each have 1 connection.
Nodes 4 and 6 each have 2 connections.
Nodes 8 and 9 each have 3 connections.
Nodes 1 and 5 each have the highest number of connections with 4 connections.

Now, we'll relabel the vertices according to the number of connections:

Node 7 (0 connections) -> relabeled as Node 0
Nodes 0, 3, and 7 (1 connection) -> relabeled as Nodes 1, 2, and 3
Nodes 4 and 6 (2 connections) -> relabeled as Nodes 4 and 5
Nodes 8 and 9 (3 connections) -> relabeled as Nodes 6 and 7
Nodes 1 and 5 (4 connections) -> relabeled as Nodes 8 and 9

The edges that can form triangles based on the degree-based ordering are: (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 5), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5).

By counting the triangles, we find:

Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>.
