Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each vertex:

Vertex 0: Degree 2
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 1
Vertex 3: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 2
Vertex 6: Degree 1
Vertex 7: Degree 1
Vertex 8: Degree 2
Vertex 9: Degree 4

Now, we sort the vertices by their degrees:

Vertices in order: 2, 6, 7, 0, 5, 8, 9, 1, 4, 3

Now, we relabel the graph according to the new order:

New edges: (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 1) (4, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4)

Now, we count the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 4>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 5>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
