Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 0, 6, 8, 2, 3

After renaming the nodes based on their degrees:
1-5, 4-1, 5-0, 7-3, 9-1, 0-2, 6-6, 8-4, 2-7, 3-8

Now we analyze the edges using the degree-based ordering:
(1, 2) [1 shares connection with 7, 8]
(1, 3) [1, 2, 3 form triangle <1, 2, 3>]
(2, 8) [2 shares connection with 1, 3]
(3, 1) - Skip because vertex 3 has more connections
(3, 6) - Skip because vertex 3 has more connections
(4, 8) [4 shares connection with 1, 0]
(0, 5) [0 shares connection with 1]
(0, 7) - Skip because vertex 0 has more connections
(6, 3) - Skip because vertex 6 has more connections
(6, 9) - Skip because vertex 6 has more connections
(7, 0) - Skip because vertex 7 has more connections
(8, 2) [8 shares connection with 1, 3]
(8, 4) [8 shares connection with 1, 0]

Total number of triangles: 1
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 3>
