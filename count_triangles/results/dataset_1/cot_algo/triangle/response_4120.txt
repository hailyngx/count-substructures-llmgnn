Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now we relabel the nodes in ascending order based on their degree:

Node 0 (2 connections) -> Node 0
Node 2 (2 connections) -> Node 1
Node 8 (2 connections) -> Node 2
Node 9 (2 connections) -> Node 3
Node 3 (3 connections) -> Node 4
Node 4 (3 connections) -> Node 5
Node 5 (3 connections) -> Node 6
Node 6 (3 connections) -> Node 7
Node 7 (3 connections) -> Node 8
Node 1 (3 connections) -> Node 9

Based on the relabeling, we can now use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

1. (0, 3) and (0, 5) share Node 0 -> Triangle: <0, 3, 5>
2. (1, 2) has no common connections.
3. (1, 4) and (1, 6) share Node 1 -> Triangle: <1, 4, 6>
4. (2, 6) has no common connections.
5. (3, 0) and (3, 5) share Node 0 -> Triangle: <0, 3, 5>
6. (3, 5) and (3, 7) share Node 3 -> Triangle: <3, 5, 7>
7. (4, 1) has no common connections.
8. (4, 7) has no common connections.
9. (5, 0) and (5, 3) share Node 0 -> Triangle: <0, 3, 5>
10. (5, 3) and (5, 9) share Node 3 -> Triangle: <3, 5, 9>
11. (6, 1) has no common connections.
12. (7, 3) and (7, 4) share Node 3 -> Triangle: <3, 4, 7>
13. (7, 4) and (7, 6) share Node 4 -> Triangle: <4, 6, 7>
14. (8, 4) has no common connections.
15. (8, 9) has no common connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, and <4, 6, 7>.
