Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following relabeling:  
- Node 0 has 2 connections  
- Node 1 has 0 connections  
- Node 2 has 4 connections  
- Node 3 has 4 connections  
- Node 4 has 6 connections  
- Node 5 has 2 connections  
- Node 6 has 3 connections  
- Node 7 has 1 connection  
- Node 8 has 4 connections  
- Node 9 has 4 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:  
1. <0, 2, 4>  
2. <2, 3, 4>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
