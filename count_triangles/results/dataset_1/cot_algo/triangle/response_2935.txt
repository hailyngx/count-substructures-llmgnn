Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices: 4, 3, 5, 6, 1, 9, 8, 0, 2, 7

The sorted edges are:
(4, 3), (3, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (1, 9), (9, 8), (8, 0), (0, 2), (2, 7), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 9), (7, 6), (7, 3), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 8), (0, 7), (8, 9), (9, 7)

Now, we count the triangles:
[9]

Unique triangles: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <7, 6, 1>, <7, 9, 8>, <7, 0, 2>, <7, 0, 8>, <7, 2, 0>
