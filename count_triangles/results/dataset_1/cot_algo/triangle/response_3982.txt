Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order and relabeling them accordingly, the graph looks as follows:

Vertices: 6, 7, 1, 2, 5, 4, 0, 3, 9, 8

Edges to consider based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (6, 9), (7, 8)

Triangles found:
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <4, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
