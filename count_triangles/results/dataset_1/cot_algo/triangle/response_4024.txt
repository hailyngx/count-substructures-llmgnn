Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Based on the edges provided, the sorted list of vertices is:  

Node 7 - 0 connections  
Node 1 - 1 connection  
Node 3 - 1 connection  
Node 4 - 1 connection  
Node 5 - 2 connections  
Node 6 - 3 connections  
Node 2 - 3 connections  
Node 9 - 4 connections  
Node 8 - 7 connections  
Node 0 - 8 connections  

Using Degree-Based Ordering, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <8, 2, 9>
2. Triangle <8, 1, 4>
3. Triangle <8, 0, 9>
4. Triangle <8, 0, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 0, 6>
6. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
7. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
8. Triangle <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
