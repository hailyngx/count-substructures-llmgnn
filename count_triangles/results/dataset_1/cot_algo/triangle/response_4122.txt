Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, we have:  

Vertices: 5, 6, 8, 7, 2, 0, 1, 3, 9, 4  

The edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections are:  
(4, 8) (6, 9) (8, 9) (7, 9) (0, 9) (2, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (1, 4) (3, 8) (2, 1) (4, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3)  

The triangles formed by the shared connections between vertices on these edges are:  
<0, 4, 7> <0, 4, 9> <0, 7, 9> <1, 2, 3> <1, 2, 4> <1, 3, 4> <1, 5, 3> <1, 8, 3> <1, 9, 4> <2, 3, 7> <2, 7, 9> <3, 4, 8> <3, 6, 9> <4, 7, 9> <8, 4, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
