Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices by the number of connections:
Nodes in ascending order of connections: 
1. Node 1 (1 connection)
2. Node 2 (1 connection)
3. Node 4 (1 connection)
4. Node 6 (1 connection)
5. Node 7 (1 connection)
6. Node 3 (2 connections)
7. Node 8 (3 connections)
8. Node 5 (6 connections)
9. Node 0 (9 connections)
10. Node 9 (9 connections)

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
Nodes relabeled according to degree:
1. Node 8
2. Node 2
3. Node 1
4. Node 7
5. Node 6
6. Node 4
7. Node 3
8. Node 5
9. Node 0
10. Node 9

3. Count the triangles:
- Checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
  - (1, 8): No triangles
  - (1, 9): No triangles
  - (2, 9): No triangles
  - (3, 5): Triangle <3, 5, 9>
  - (3, 9): Triangle <3, 5, 9>
  - (4, 5): No triangles
  - (5, 0): No triangles
  - (5, 3): Triangle <3, 5, 9>
  - (5, 4): No triangles
  - (5, 9): Triangle <3, 5, 9>
  - (6, 0): No triangles
  - (7, 0): No triangles
  - (8, 0): No triangles
  - (8, 1): No triangles
  - (8, 9): Triangle <3, 5, 9>
  - (9, 0): No triangles
  - (9, 2): No triangles
  - (9, 3): Triangle <3, 5, 9>
  - (9, 5): Triangle <3, 5, 9>
  
4. Total number of triangles: [4]
   
Unique triangles found:
- <3, 5, 9>
