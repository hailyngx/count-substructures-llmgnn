Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices with their connections:
- 0: 2
- 1: 3
- 2: 3
- 3: 1
- 4: 3
- 5: 2
- 6: 2
- 8: 1
- 9: 4

Vertices sorted by their degrees:
3, 8
0, 5, 6
2
1, 4
9

Now, we will count the triangles:
- For edge (0, 1):
  - Common neighbors: None

- For edge (0, 9):
  - Common neighbors: 5

- For edge (1, 2):
  - Common neighbors: 4

- For edge (1, 4):
  - Common neighbors: 2

- For edge (2, 4):
  - Common neighbors: 1

- For edge (2, 8):
  - Common neighbors: None

- For edge (3, 6):
  - Common neighbors: None

- For edge (4, 5):
  - Common neighbors: 9

- For edge (5, 9):
  - Common neighbors: None

- For edge (6, 9):
  - Common neighbors: None

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles: 
<5, 9, 0>
<2, 1, 4>
