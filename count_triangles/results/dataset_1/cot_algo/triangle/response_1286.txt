Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we get the following relabeling: 
Vertices: 3, 9, 1, 6, 8, 7, 5, 4, 2, 0

Now, following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles in the graph: 

We start counting the triangles formed by each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [5]
