Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling the vertices accordingly, the sorted list of vertices is: 
Node 5 (Degree 2)
Node 1 (Degree 2)
Node 9 (Degree 2)
Node 6 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 2)
Node 8 (Degree 2)
Node 0 (Degree 3)
Node 7 (Degree 3)
Node 2 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 4)

Now, we will consider the edges while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 2): Forms a triangle <0, 2, 1>
- Edge (0, 6): No triangles formed
- Edge (0, 7): Forms a triangle <0, 7, 3>
- Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 0): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 1): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 7): Forms a triangle <3, 7, 0>
- Edge (3, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (4, 6): No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 9): No triangles formed

The total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 1>, <0, 7, 3>, and <3, 7, 0>.
