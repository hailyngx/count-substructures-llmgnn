Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Degrees: 2, 5, 2, 2, 4, 3, 3, 1, 2, 5

Ordered vertices: 7, 0, 2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 4, 9, 1

Now, let's analyze the edges according to the degree-based ordering:
1. (7, 6): Not considered, as 7 has fewer connections than 6.
2. (0, 1): Considered. Shared connection with 6 forms triangle <0, 1, 6>.
3. (2, 4): Considered. Shared connection with 9 forms triangle <2, 4, 9>.
4. (3, 9): Not considered, as 3 has fewer connections than 9.
5. (8, 1): Not considered, as 8 has fewer connections than 1.
6. (5, 9): Not considered, as 5 has fewer connections than 9.
7. (6, 4): Considered. Shared connection with 0 forms triangle <0, 4, 6>.
8. (4, 1): Not considered, as 4 has fewer connections than 1.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 6>, <2, 4, 9>
