Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes by degree:
0: degree 2
1: degree 4
2: degree 4
3: degree 3
4: degree 5
5: degree 2
6: degree 4
7: degree 5
8: degree 4
9: degree 5

Re-label the nodes accordingly:
0: label 0
5: label 1
3: label 2
2: label 3
6: label 4
8: label 5
1: label 6
7: label 7
4: label 8
9: label 9

Counting the triangles:
Triangles = 20

[20]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
