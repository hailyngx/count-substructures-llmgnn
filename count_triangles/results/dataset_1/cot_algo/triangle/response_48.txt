Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Nodes: 3, 5, 9, 7, 0, 6, 1, 5, 4, 8

Sorted: 3, 0, 6, 7, 9, 1, 5, 2, 4, 8

Now, we will count the number of triangles based on the sorted vertices.

Triangles:
<1, 8, 4>
<1, 8, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<4, 8, 7>

Total number of triangles: [4]
