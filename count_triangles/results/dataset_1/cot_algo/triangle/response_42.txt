Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective degrees:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 1
- Vertex 2: degree 1
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 1
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 5

Reordering vertices based on degree:
- Vertex 1 and 2 remain the same
- Vertex 0 now becomes vertex 3
- Vertex 3 now becomes vertex 6
- Vertex 4 now becomes vertex 5
- Vertex 5 now becomes vertex 7
- Vertex 7 now becomes vertex 8
- Vertex 8 now becomes vertex 9
- Vertex 9 now becomes vertex 10

Considering the edges with lower labeled vertices having fewer connections:
- Edge (1, 4) results in a triangle: <1, 4, 5>
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle
- Edge (3, 0) results in a triangle: <0, 3, 6>
- Edge (4, 1) results in a triangle: <1, 4, 5>
- Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle
- Edge (7, 0) results in a triangle: <0, 3, 6>
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <1, 4, 5> <0, 3, 6>
