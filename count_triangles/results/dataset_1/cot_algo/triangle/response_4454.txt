Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we sort the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes: 
1: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 1 connection
6: 1 connection
7: 5 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 1 connection

Next, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes: 
1: 0 connections
2: 1 connection
3: 2 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 5 connections
7: 6 connections
8: 7 connections
9: 8 connections

Now, we will find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. Looking at the edges, we see that (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 9) can satisfy the condition of the lower labeled node having fewer connections.

Calculating the triangles, we find:
Triangles: 
<1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <7, 8, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
