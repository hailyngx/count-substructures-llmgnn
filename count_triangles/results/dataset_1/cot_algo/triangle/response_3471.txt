Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Vertices by number of connections:  
Vertex 3: 0 connections  
Vertex 6: 0 connections  
Vertex 5: 1 connection  
Vertex 2: 1 connection  
Vertex 1: 2 connections  
Vertex 4: 3 connections  
Vertex 7: 3 connections  
Vertex 0: 4 connections  
Vertex 8: 4 connections  
Vertex 9: 6 connections  

Sort the vertices:  
Vertex 3 (0 connections)  
Vertex 6 (0 connections)  
Vertex 5 (1 connection)  
Vertex 2 (1 connection)  
Vertex 1 (2 connections)  
Vertex 4 (3 connections)  
Vertex 7 (3 connections)  
Vertex 0 (4 connections)  
Vertex 8 (4 connections)  
Vertex 9 (6 connections)
