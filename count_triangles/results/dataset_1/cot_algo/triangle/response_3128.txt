Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are as follows:  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 6: 2 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 9: 2 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections, we get the following unique triangles:  
<0, 1, 4>  
<0, 3, 7>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
