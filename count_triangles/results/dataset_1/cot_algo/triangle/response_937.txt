Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 9: 1 connection
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 1: 6 connections
- Node 3: 6 connections
- Node 5: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
- <2, 1, 3>
- <2, 1, 6>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 6, 5>
- <6, 1, 3>
- <6, 1, 5>
- <6, 3, 5>
- <8, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
