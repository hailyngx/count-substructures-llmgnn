Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:

- Vertex 0 has degree 4
- Vertex 1 has degree 2
- Vertex 2 has degree 1
- Vertex 3 has degree 3
- Vertex 4 has degree 5
- Vertex 5 has degree 7
- Vertex 6 has degree 2
- Vertex 8 has degree 2
- Vertex 9 has degree 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:

- Vertex 2 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 1 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 6 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 8 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 9 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 3 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 0 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 4 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 5 (degree 7) becomes Vertex 8

Now, let's list the edges in the order specified by the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- (2, 5)
- (1, 5)
- (3, 5)
- (6, 5)
- (8, 6)
- (0, 5)
- (9, 4)
- (4, 5)
- (5, 6)

Now, count the triangles by checking shared neighbors:

Triangles:
- <0, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <5, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
