Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 0 (Degree 4)  
Vertex 1 (Degree 1)  
Vertex 2 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 3 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 4 (Degree 4)  
Vertex 5 (Degree 4)  
Vertex 6 (Degree 1)  
Vertex 7 (Degree 5)  
Vertex 8 (Degree 1)  
Vertex 9 (Degree 3)  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  

Therefore, we analyze the following edges:  
(0, 1) - No triangles  
(0, 4) - Triangle <0, 4, 7>  
(0, 5) - Triangle <0, 5, 2>  
(1, 0) - No triangles  
(2, 5) - No triangles  
(3, 4) - No triangles  
(3, 6) - No triangles  
(3, 8) - No triangles  
(4, 0) - No triangles  
(5, 2) - No triangles  
(6, 3) - No triangles  
(7, 0) - No triangles  
(8, 3) - No triangles  
(9, 5) - No triangles  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7> and <0, 5, 2>.
