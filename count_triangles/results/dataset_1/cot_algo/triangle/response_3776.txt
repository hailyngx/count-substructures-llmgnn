Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 7 -> Degree 1
Node 2 -> Degree 2
Node 8 -> Degree 2
Node 3 -> Degree 3
Node 5 -> Degree 3
Node 1 -> Degree 4
Node 9 -> Degree 4
Node 6 -> Degree 4
Node 4 -> Degree 5
Node 0 -> Degree 6

Using this degree-based ordering, we can now count the triangles in the graph.

There are 9 triangles in total:
[9]

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 0, 9> <3, 1, 8> <5, 0, 7> <5, 0, 6> <2, 4, 8> <4, 3, 6> <4, 0, 2> <0, 5, 7> <9, 0, 6>
