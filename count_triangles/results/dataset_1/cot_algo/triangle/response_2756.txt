Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 3 has degree 2.
Node 5 has degree 2.
Node 8 has degree 2.
Node 4 has degree 3.
Node 9 has degree 3.
Node 1 has degree 4.
Node 7 has degree 4.
Node 2 has degree 4.
Node 0 has degree 5.
Node 6 has degree 6.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has 2 connections and Node 4 has 3 connections.
- Edge (2, 5): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 5 has 2 connections.
- Edge (8, 0): Node 8 has 2 connections and Node 0 has 5 connections.
- Edge (7, 9): Node 7 has 4 connections and Node 9 has 3 connections.

So, among these edges, the triangles formed are:
- Triangle <2, 5, 6> with shared connection at (2, 6).
- Triangle <0, 7, 9> with shared connection at (7, 9).

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
