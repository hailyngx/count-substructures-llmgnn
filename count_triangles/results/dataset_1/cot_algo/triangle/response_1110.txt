Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will create a sorted list based on the degree of each node:
(0: 2 connections), (2: 1 connection), (3: 2 connections), (6: 3 connections), (9: 1 connection), (4: 3 connections), (5: 3 connections), (1: 5 connections), (7: 4 connections), (8: 3 connections).

Now, we will start counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3, while node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8. Both nodes share node 1 in common, forming a triangle <0, 1, 4>.

2. Edge (0, 3): Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3, while node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 2. Both nodes share node 0 in common, forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.

3. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8, while node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5. Both nodes share node 1 in common, forming a triangle <1, 0, 4>.

4. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8, while node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8. Both nodes share node 5 in common, forming a triangle <1, 5, 8>.

5. Edge (4, 2): Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5, while node 2 is connected to node 4. Both nodes share node 4 in common, forming a triangle <4, 2, 1>.

6. Edge (6, 5): Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9, while node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8. Both nodes share node 6 in common, forming a triangle <6, 5, 1>.

7. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9, while node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9. Both nodes share node 6 in common, forming a triangle <6, 7, 5>.

8. Edge (7, 3): Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 9, while node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 2. Both nodes share node 7 in common, forming a triangle <7, 3, 0>.

9. Edge (7, 9): Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 9, while node 9 is connected to nodes 7. Both nodes share node 7 in common, forming a triangle <7, 9, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9] in this graph.
