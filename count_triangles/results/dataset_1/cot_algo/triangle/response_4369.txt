Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree from least connected to most connected, the new ordering is as follows:
Node 3 (degree 1)
Node 5 (degree 1)
Node 6 (degree 1)
Node 1 (degree 1)
Node 9 (degree 1)
Node 0 (degree 2)
Node 1 (degree 2)
Node 3 (degree 2)
Node 6 (degree 2)
Node 7 (degree 3)
Node 8 (degree 4)
Node 2 (degree 5)
Node 4 (degree 6)

Checking the edges in the order given, we find that the triangles formed are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
