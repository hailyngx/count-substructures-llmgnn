Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we go through each edge to count the triangles:
1. (0, 3): Shared connections with 0 and 3 are 8, 2. Triangle: <0, 3, 2>.
2. (0, 8): No triangle found.
3. (1, 2): No triangle found.
4. (1, 9): No triangle found.
5. (2, 3): Shared connections with 2 and 3 are 1, 7. Triangle: <2, 3, 7>.
6. (2, 7): Shared connections with 2 and 7 are 3, 4. Triangle: <2, 7, 4>.
7. (3, 4): Shared connections with 3 and 4 are 2, 7. Triangle: <3, 4, 7>.
8. (4, 5): Shared connections with 4 and 5 are 7. Triangle: <4, 5, 7>.
9. (4, 7): Shared connections with 4 and 7 are 3, 5. Triangle: <4, 7, 5>.
10. (5, 7): Shared connections with 5 and 7 are 4. Triangle: <5, 7, 4>.
11. (7, 9): Shared connections with 7 and 9 are 5. Triangle: <7, 9, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 2>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 7, 4>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 5>, <5, 7, 4>, <7, 9, 5>.
