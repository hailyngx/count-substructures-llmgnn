Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their degrees:
0 (degree: 1)
3 (degree: 1)
2 (degree: 1)
6 (degree: 1)
8 (degree: 2)
5 (degree: 2)
9 (degree: 2)
4 (degree: 2)
7 (degree: 2)
1 (degree: 6)
