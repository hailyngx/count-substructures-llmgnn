Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0 (3 connections)
1 (2 connections)
2 (2 connections)
6 (2 connections)
8 (1 connection)
9 (2 connections)
3 (2 connections)
7 (2 connections)
4 (4 connections)
5 (3 connections)

Now, let's count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3):
    - Shared connections: None

2. Edge (0, 5):
    - Shared connections: 2

3. Edge (0, 7):
    - Shared connections: None

4. Edge (1, 4):
    - Shared connections: None

5. Edge (1, 9):
    - Shared connections: None

6. Edge (2, 5):
    - Shared connections: None

7. Edge (2, 6):
    - Shared connections: None

8. Edge (3, 0):
    - Shared connections: None

9. Edge (3, 4):
    - Shared connections: None

10. Edge (4, 1):
    - Shared connections: None

11. Edge (4, 3):
    - Shared connections: None

12. Edge (4, 6):
    - Shared connections: None

13. Edge (5, 0):
    - Shared connections: 3

14. Edge (5, 2):
    - Shared connections: None

15. Edge (5, 8):
    - Shared connections: None

16. Edge (6, 2):
    - Shared connections: None

17. Edge (6, 4):
    - Shared connections: None

18. Edge (7, 0):
    - Shared connections: None

19. Edge (7, 9):
    - Shared connections: None

20. Edge (8, 5):
    - Shared connections: None

21. Edge (9, 1):
    - Shared connections: None

22. Edge (9, 7):
    - Shared connections: None
