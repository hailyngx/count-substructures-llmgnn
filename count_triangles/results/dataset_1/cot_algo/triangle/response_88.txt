Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted vertices are then relabeled accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices with their connections is as follows:
1. Node 1: 1 connection
2. Node 6: 1 connection
3. Node 7: 2 connections
4. Node 8: 2 connections
5. Node 0: 3 connections
6. Node 1: 3 connections
7. Node 4: 4 connections
8. Node 9: 4 connections
9. Node 3: 5 connections
10. Node 2: 6 connections

Next, we will analyze each edge:
1. Edge (0, 4): Nodes 0 and 4 have 3 common neighbors (2, 5, 7). Therefore, a triangle is formed: <0, 4, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 have 2 common neighbors (3, 4). Therefore, a triangle is formed: <0, 5, 4>.
3. Edge (1, 7): Since Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 7, we skip this edge.
4. Edge (2, 3): Since Node 2 has more connections than Node 3, we skip this edge.
5. Edge (2, 4): Since Node 2 has more connections than Node 4, we skip this edge.
6. Edge (2, 7): Since Node 2 has more connections than Node 7, we skip this edge.
7. Edge (2, 8): Nodes 2 and 8 have 1 common neighbor (9). Therefore, a triangle is formed: <2, 8, 9>.
8. Edge (3, 2): Since Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 2, we skip this edge.
9. Edge (3, 5): Nodes 3 and 5 have 2 common neighbors (0, 4). Therefore, a triangle is formed: <3, 5, 4>.
10. Edge (3, 6): Since Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 6, we skip this edge.
11. Edge (3, 9): Nodes 3 and 9 have 2 common neighbors (5, 8). Therefore, a triangle is formed: <3, 9, 5>.
12. Edge (4, 0): Since Node 4 has more connections than Node 0, we skip this edge.
13. Edge (4, 2): Since Node 4 has more connections than Node 2, we skip this edge.
14. Edge (4, 5): Nodes 4 and 5 have 3 common neighbors (0, 3, 9). Therefore, a triangle is formed: <4, 5, 0>.
15. Edge (5, 0): Since Node 5 has more connections than Node 0, we skip this edge.
16. Edge (5, 3): Since Node 5 has more connections than Node 3, we skip this edge.
17. Edge (5, 4): Since Node 5 has more connections than Node 4, we skip this edge.
18. Edge (5, 9): Nodes 5 and 9 have 2 common neighbors (3, 4). Therefore, a triangle is formed: <5, 9, 3>.
19. Edge (6, 3): Since Node 6 has fewer connections than Node 3, we skip this edge.
20. Edge (7, 1): Since Node 7 has more connections than Node 1, we skip this edge.
21. Edge (7, 2): Since Node 7 has more connections than Node 2, we skip this edge.
22. Edge (8, 2): Since Node 8 has more connections than Node 2, we skip this edge.
23. Edge (8, 9): Nodes 8 and 9 have 1 common neighbor (2). Therefore, a triangle is formed: <8, 9, 2>.
24. Edge (9, 3): Since Node 9 has more connections than Node 3, we skip this edge.
25. Edge (9, 5): Since Node 9 has more connections than Node 5, we skip this edge.
26. Edge (9, 8): Since Node 9 has more connections than Node 8, we skip this edge.

Therefore, the total number of triangles identified in the graph is [5].
