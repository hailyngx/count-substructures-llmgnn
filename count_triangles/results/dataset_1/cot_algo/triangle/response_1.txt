Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is as follows: 

Vertices: 
(3) - 3 connections
(7) - 3 connections
(0) - 4 connections
(1) - 4 connections
(9) - 4 connections
(5) - 5 connections
(6) - 5 connections
(8) - 5 connections
(2) - 6 connections
(4) - 6 connections

Now, we will look at the edges in the graph based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>

The total number of triangles is [11].
