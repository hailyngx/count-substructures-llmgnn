Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we can relabel them as follows:
Node 4 has 0 connections.
Nodes 0 and 5 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 6 and 8 have 5 connections each.
  
Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge based on the degree-based ordering:

1. Edge (0, 2):
   - Node 0 has connections with nodes 2 and 5.
   - Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, and 8.
   - The shared connection between nodes 0 and 2 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 5. (0, 2, 5)

2. Edge (0, 5):
   - Node 5 has connections with nodes 0, 6, and 6.
   - There are no triangles formed with this edge.
   
3. Edge (0, 6):
   - Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9.
   - There are no triangles formed with this edge.

4. Edge (1, 2):
   - Node 1 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8.
   - There are no triangles formed with this edge.

5. Edge (1, 3):
   - Node 3 has connections with nodes 1, 2, and 2.
   - There are no triangles formed with this edge.

6. Edge (1, 6):
   - Node 1 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8.
   - Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9.
   - The shared connection between nodes 1 and 6 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9. (0, 1, 6)

7. Remaining edges do not form any new triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5> and <0, 1, 6>.
