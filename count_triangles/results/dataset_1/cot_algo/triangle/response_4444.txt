Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 3 - 0 connections  
Node 7 - 0 connections  
Node 0 - 3 connections  
Node 2 - 3 connections  
Node 4 - 3 connections  
Node 3 - 4 connections  
Node 5 - 4 connections  
Node 6 - 5 connections  
Node 8 - 5 connections  
Node 9 - 6 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:  
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 1, 9>
4. <0, 2, 5>
5. <1, 8, 9>
6. <1, 5, 8>
7. <1, 5, 9>
8. <1, 6, 9>
9. <2, 5, 9>
10. <4, 5, 9>
11. <5, 8, 9>
12. <5, 6, 9>
13. <5, 9, 0>
14. <8, 9, 6>

Total number of triangles: [14]
