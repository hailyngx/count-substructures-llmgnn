Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now, let's label the nodes accordingly:
Node 6 (1 connection)
Node 1 (2 connections)
Node 2 (2 connections)
Node 3 (2 connections)
Node 5 (2 connections)
Node 8 (2 connections)
Node 9 (2 connections)
Node 0 (3 connections)
Node 4 (3 connections)
Node 7 (3 connections)

Next, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections:
- Edge (0, 3): Shared connection with node 9 <0, 3, 9>
- Edge (0, 5): No triangle formed
- Edge (0, 8): No triangle formed
- Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed
- Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 1): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 9): No triangle formed
- Edge (3, 0): Shared connection with node 9 <0, 3, 9>
- Edge (3, 9): Shared connection with node 0 <0, 3, 9>
- Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed
- Edge (4, 7): No triangle formed
- Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed
- Edge (5, 0): No triangle formed
- Edge (5, 4): No triangle formed
- Edge (6, 7): No triangle formed
- Edge (7, 1): No triangle formed
- Edge (7, 4): No triangle formed
- Edge (7, 6): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 0): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 4): No triangle formed
- Edge (9, 2): No triangle formed
- Edge (9, 3): Shared connection with node 0 <0, 3, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2] 
Triangles found: <0, 3, 9> <0, 3, 9>
