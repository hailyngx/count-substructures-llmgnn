Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we get the following relabeling: 

- Node 0 (degree 4)
- Node 9 (degree 2)
- Node 5 (degree 2)
- Node 7 (degree 2)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 4)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 1 (degree 5)
- Node 8 (degree 5)
- Node 4 (degree 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph.

Calculating the triangles:
- For edge (0, 1): <0, 1, 4>
- For edge (0, 2): No triangles formed
- For edge (0, 4): No triangles formed
- For edge (0, 8): <0, 1, 8> and <0, 4, 8> 
- For edge (1, 3): <1, 3, 6>
- For edge (1, 4): <1, 4, 6>
- For edge (1, 6): No triangles formed
- For edge (1, 7): No triangles formed
- For edge (2, 5): No triangles formed
- For edge (2, 8): No triangles formed
- For edge (2, 9): No triangles formed
- For edge (3, 5): No triangles formed
- For edge (3, 6): <3, 6, 1>
- For edge (3, 8): <3, 8, 0>
- For edge (4, 6): No triangles formed
- For edge (4, 8): No triangles formed
- For edge (5, 6): No triangles formed
- For edge (6, 7): No triangles formed
- For edge (9, 2): No triangles formed

Total number of triangles in the graph: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 1>
