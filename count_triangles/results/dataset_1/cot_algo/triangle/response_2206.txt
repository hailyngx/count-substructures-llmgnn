Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:
Node 5: Degree 1
Nodes 1, 8, 9: Degree 2
Nodes 0, 6: Degree 3
Nodes 2, 7: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 6

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 5 (Degree 1) -> Node 0
Nodes 1, 8, 9 (Degree 2) -> Nodes 1, 2, 3
Nodes 0, 6 (Degree 3) -> Nodes 4, 5
Nodes 2, 7 (Degree 4) -> Nodes 6, 7
Node 4 (Degree 5) -> Node 8
Node 3 (Degree 6) -> Node 9

Now we will list the edges in the sorted order:
(0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 7)

Now let's find the triangles:
1. (0, 3, 9)
2. (0, 7, 4)
3. (1, 4, 7) 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 9>, <0, 7, 4>, <1, 4, 7>.
