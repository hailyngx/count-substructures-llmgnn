Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their degrees. 

Sorted vertices by degree:
Vertex 1: 0 connections
Vertex 9: 0 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections

Based on the sorted vertices, we will now analyze each edge in ascending order of the vertices' labels.

Triangles found:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <2, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
