Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:
Vertex 0 - 3 connections
Vertex 1 - 3 connections
Vertex 2 - 1 connection
Vertex 3 - 1 connection
Vertex 4 - 2 connections
Vertex 5 - 4 connections
Vertex 6 - 1 connection
Vertex 7 - 4 connections
Vertex 8 - 4 connections
Vertex 9 - 2 connections

Based on the relabeled vertices, we will only consider the following edges for counting triangles:
(0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 9)

Now, we will check for shared connections between the vertices of each edge to find triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<4, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
