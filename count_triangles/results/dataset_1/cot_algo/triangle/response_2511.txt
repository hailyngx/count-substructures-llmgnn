Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes sorted by degrees:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
