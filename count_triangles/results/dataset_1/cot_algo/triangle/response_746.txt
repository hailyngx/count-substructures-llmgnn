Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least connected to most connected, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 1: 1 (degree 0)
Node 7: 2 (degree 0)
Node 0: 3 (degree 4)
Node 4: 4 (degree 2)
Node 5: 5 (degree 2)
Node 8: 6 (degree 1)
Node 2: 7 (degree 3)
Node 6: 8 (degree 5)
Node 9: 9 (degree 4)
Node 3: 10 (degree 5)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now analyze the edges in the graph:

- Edge (1, 7): Skipped because both nodes have degree 0.
- Edge (7, 1): Skipped because both nodes have degree 0.
- Edge (0, 3): Skipped because both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (0, 4): Skipped because Node 3 (degree 5) has more connections than Node 4 (degree 2).
- Edge (0, 5): Skipped because Node 3 (degree 5) has more connections than Node 5 (degree 2).
- Edge (0, 6): Skipped because Node 3 (degree 5) has more connections than Node 8 (degree 5).
- Edge (1, 3): Skipped because both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (3, 5): Since Node 5 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 3 (degree 5), we check for shared connections. Shared connection: Node 0. Triangle <0, 3, 5> found.
- Edge (2, 6): Skipped because both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (2, 9): Skipped because Node 7 (degree 3) has more connections than Node 9 (degree 4).
- Edge (3, 7): Skipped because both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (6, 8): Skipped because both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (9, 2): Skipped because Node 7 (degree 3) has more connections than Node 9 (degree 4).
- Edge (9, 3): Since Node 9 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 3 (degree 5), we check for shared connections. Shared connections: Node 0, Node 6. Two triangles found: <0, 3, 9> and <3, 6, 9>.
- Edge (6, 9): Skipped because Node 9 (degree 4) has more connections than Node 8 (degree 5).

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <3, 6, 9>.
