Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's organize the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 7 has degree 0.
- Vertices 2 and 9 have degree 1.
- Vertices 3 and 7 have degree 2.
- Vertices 0 and 1 have degree 3.
- Vertices 4 and 5 have degree 4.
- Vertex 6 has degree 6.
- Vertex 8 has degree 5.

Now, we will go through each edge considering the lower degree vertex first:
1. Edge (0, 4) - Shared connections: 6 => Triangle <0, 4, 6>
2. Edge (0, 6) - Shared connections: None
3. Edge (0, 8) - Shared connections: None
4. Edge (1, 5) - Shared connections: None
5. Edge (1, 6) - Shared connections: None
6. Edge (1, 9) - Shared connections: None
7. Edge (2, 6) - Shared connections: None
8. Edge (3, 5) - Shared connections: None
9. Edge (3, 8) - Shared connections: None
10. Edge (4, 0) - Shared connections: 6 => Triangle <0, 4, 6>
11. Edge (4, 5) - Shared connections: None
12. Edge (4, 6) - Shared connections: None
13. Edge (5, 1) - Shared connections: None
14. Edge (5, 3) - Shared connections: None
15. Edge (5, 4) - Shared connections: None
16. Edge (5, 8) - Shared connections: None
17. Edge (6, 0) - Shared connections: None
18. Edge (6, 1) - Shared connections: None
19. Edge (6, 2) - Shared connections: None
20. Edge (6, 4) - Shared connections: None
21. Edge (6, 8) - Shared connections: None
22. Edge (6, 9) - Shared connections: None
23. Edge (8, 0) - Shared connections: None
24. Edge (8, 3) - Shared connections: None
25. Edge (8, 5) - Shared connections: None
26. Edge (8, 6) - Shared connections: None
27. Edge (9, 1) - Shared connections: None
28. Edge (9, 6) - Shared connections: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6> and <0, 4, 6>.
