Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then we proceed with counting the triangles based on the given edges.

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 2: 7 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 4)
(0, 7)
(1, 2)
(1, 4)
(1, 9)
(5, 6)
(5, 7)
(8, 2)

Counting the triangles formed:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <1, 2, 4>
3. <1, 2, 9>
4. <5, 6, 7>
5. <2, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [5]
