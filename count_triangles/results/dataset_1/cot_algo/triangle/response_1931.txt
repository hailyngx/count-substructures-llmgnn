Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

0: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
6: 1 connection
9: 2 connections
5: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
4: 5 connections
3: 5 connections
2: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check for triangles:

Triangles:
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 8, 1>
<4, 8, 2>

Total number of triangles: [7]
