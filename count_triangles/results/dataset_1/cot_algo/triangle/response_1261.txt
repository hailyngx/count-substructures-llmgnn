Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following new vertex labels: 
Node 5 (Degree 2) 
Node 4 (Degree 3) 
Node 0 (Degree 3) 
Node 1 (Degree 3) 
Node 8 (Degree 4) 
Node 9 (Degree 4) 
Node 3 (Degree 4) 
Node 2 (Degree 4) 
Node 7 (Degree 4) 
Node 6 (Degree 6) 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles as follows:

1. For edge (0, 5):
Node 0 and Node 5 share Node 4 as a connection. Therefore, we have the triangle <0, 4, 5>.

2. For edge (0, 6):
Node 0 and Node 6 share Node 1 as a connection. Therefore, we have the triangle <0, 1, 6>.

3. For edge (1, 3):
Node 1 and Node 3 share Node 6 as a connection. Therefore, we have the triangle <1, 3, 6>.

4. Edge (1, 6) is not processed as Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 6.

5. Edge (1, 8) is not processed as Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 8.

6. For edge (2, 6):
Node 2 and Node 6 share Node 1 as a connection. Therefore, we have the triangle <2, 1, 6>.

7. For edge (2, 8):
Node 2 and Node 8 share Node 1 as a connection. Therefore, we have the triangle <2, 1, 8>.

8. For edge (2, 9):
Node 2 and Node 9 share Node 6 as a connection. Therefore, we have the triangle <2, 6, 9>.

9. For edge (3, 1):
Node 3 and Node 1 share Node 6 as a connection. Therefore, we have the triangle <3, 1, 6>.

10. For edge (3, 4):
Node 3 and Node 4 share Node 7 as a connection. Therefore, we have the triangle <3, 4, 7>.

11. Edge (3, 7) is not processed as Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 7.

12. For edge (4, 3):
Node 4 and Node 3 share Node 7 as a connection. Therefore, we have the triangle <4, 3, 7>.

13. For edge (4, 5):
Node 4 and Node 5 share Node 0 as a connection. Therefore, we have the triangle <4, 0, 5>.

14. Edge (4, 7) is not processed as Node 4 has fewer connections than Node 7.

15. For edge (5, 0):
Node 5 and Node 0 share Node 4 as a connection. Therefore, we have the triangle <5, 4, 0>.

16. For edge (5, 4):
Node 5 and Node 4 share Node 0 as a connection. Therefore, we have the triangle <5, 0, 4>.

The total number of triangles is [16].
