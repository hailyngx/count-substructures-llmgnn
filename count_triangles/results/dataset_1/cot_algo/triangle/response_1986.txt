Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 4 has 2 connections.
Vertices 6 and 9 have 1 connection each.
Vertices 1, 5, 6, and 9 have 2 connections each.
Vertices 3, 4, and 8 have 3 connections each.
Vertices 0 and 7 have 4 connections each.

The vertex ordering will be: 4, 6, 9, 1, 5, 2, 3, 8, 0, 7.

Now, we will go through each edge based on the vertex ordering and count the triangles:

Checking (0, 1):
Vertex 0 has connections with 3, 2, 1, and 9.
Vertex 1 has connections with 7.
Vertices 0 and 1 share a connection with vertex 7, forming a triangle <0, 1, 7>.

Checking (0, 2):
Vertex 0 has connections with 3, 2, 1, and 9.
Vertex 2 has connections with 8.
Since vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 2, we skip this edge.

Checking (0, 3):
Vertex 0 has connections with 3, 2, 1, and 9.
Vertex 3 has connections with 5.
Vertices 0 and 3 share a connection with vertex 5, forming a triangle <0, 3, 5>.

Checking (0, 9):
Vertex 0 has connections with 3, 2, 1, and 9.
Vertex 9 has no connections with the previous nodes.
Since vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 9, we skip this edge.

Checking (1, 7):
Vertex 1 has connections with 7.
Vertex 7 has connections with 5 and 8.
Vertex 1 and 7 share a connection with vertex 5, forming a triangle <1, 7, 5>.

Checking (2, 8):
Vertex 2 has connections with 8.
Vertex 8 has connections with 4 and 7.
Vertex 2 and 8 share a connection with vertex 4, forming a triangle <2, 8, 4>.

Checking (3, 5):
Vertex 3 has connections with 5.
Vertex 5 has connections with 7.
Vertices 3 and 5 share a connection with vertex 7, forming a triangle <3, 5, 7>.

There are 3 unique triangles in the graph:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 5>, <2, 8, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
