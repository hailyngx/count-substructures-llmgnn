Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list each node with their corresponding connections:

Node 0: 3, 8
Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 6, 9
Node 5: 2, 3
Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 7: 2, 3, 8
Node 8: 0, 3, 7
Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree in increasing order:

Node 0 (degree 2): relabel as A
Node 5 (degree 2): relabel as B
Node 1 (degree 2): relabel as C
Node 4 (degree 2): relabel as D
Node 6 (degree 3): relabel as E
Node 7 (degree 3): relabel as F
Node 2 (degree 5): relabel as G
Node 8 (degree 3): relabel as H
Node 3 (degree 6): relabel as I
Node 9 (degree 3): relabel as J

By following the degree-based ordering and considering the edges, we find the following triangles:

<0, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
