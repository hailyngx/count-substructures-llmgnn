Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new vertex ordering is as follows: 

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles. 

There are 16 triangles in this graph, which can be represented as:

[16]

And the unique triangles found are:
<2, 0, 1>
<3, 1, 0>
<2, 0, 3>
<4, 2, 0>
<5, 2, 0>
<4, 3, 1>
<5, 2, 3>
<4, 3, 2>
<6, 2, 0>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 4>
<4, 8, 7>
<9, 7, 4>
<9, 2, 0>
<9, 3, 1>
