Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each vertex in the graph:

- Vertex 0: degree = 2
- Vertex 1: degree = 1
- Vertex 2: degree = 3
- Vertex 3: degree = 3
- Vertex 4: degree = 2
- Vertex 5: degree = 6
- Vertex 6: degree = 3
- Vertex 7: degree = 3
- Vertex 8: degree = 3
- Vertex 9: degree = 3

Next, we sort the vertices based on their degrees in non-decreasing order:

- Vertex 1: degree = 1
- Vertex 0: degree = 2
- Vertex 4: degree = 2
- Vertex 6: degree = 3
- Vertex 7: degree = 3
- Vertex 8: degree = 3
- Vertex 9: degree = 3
- Vertex 2: degree = 3
- Vertex 3: degree = 3
- Vertex 5: degree = 6

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 has 2 connections and Vertex 5 has 6 connections, so we proceed.
   Shared connections between 0 and 5: 7
2. Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has 1 connection and Vertex 2 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
   No triangle formed.
3. Edge (2, 1): Vertex 1 has 1 connection and Vertex 2 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
   No triangle formed.
4. Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 has 3 connections and Vertex 4 has 2 connections, so we proceed.
   No triangle formed.
5. Edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has 3 connections and Vertex 9 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
   Shared connections between 2 and 9: 4
6. Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 has 3 connections and Vertex 5 has 6 connections, so we proceed.
   Shared connections between 3 and 5: 6
7. Edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 has 3 connections and Vertex 6 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
   Shared connections between 3 and 6: 8
8. Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 has 3 connections and Vertex 8 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
   No triangle formed.

    Shared connections between 5 and 3: 6
13. Edge (5, 6): Vertex 5 has 6 connections and Vertex 6 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    Shared connections between 5 and 6: 3
14. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has 6 connections and Vertex 7 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    Shared connections between 5 and 7: 4
15. Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 has 6 connections and Vertex 9 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    Shared connections between 5 and 9: 2

    Shared connections between 6 and 3: 8
17. Edge (6, 5): Vertex 5 has 6 connections and Vertex 6 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    Shared connections between 6 and 5: 3
18. Edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 has 3 connections and Vertex 8 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    No triangle formed.

    No triangle formed.
21. Edge (7, 5): Vertex 5 has 6 connections and Vertex 7 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    Shared connections between 7 and 5: 4
22. Edge (8, 3): Vertex 3 has 3 connections and Vertex 8 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    No triangle formed.
23. Edge (8, 6): Vertex 6 has 3 connections and Vertex 8 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    No triangle formed.
24. Edge (8, 9): Vertex 8 has 3 connections and Vertex 9 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    Shared connections between 8 and 9: 2
25. Edge (9, 2): Vertex 2 has 3 connections and Vertex 9 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    Shared connections between 9 and 2: 4
26. Edge (9, 5): Vertex 5 has 6 connections and Vertex 9 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    Shared connections between 9 and 5: 2
