Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to organize the vertices based on the number of connections each has:
Node 2: (no connections)
Nodes 1, 3, 8: (1 connection each)
Nodes 4, 6, 7, 9: (3 connections each)
Node 5: (4 connections)

Now, let's go through each edge and count the triangles:
- Edge (1, 4): Node 1 has 3 connections, Node 4 has 3 connections, and they share connections with Node 5, forming a triangle <1, 4, 5>.
- Edge (1, 5): Node 1 has 3 connections, Node 5 has 4 connections. No triangles here.
- Edge (1, 6): Node 1 has 3 connections, Node 6 has 3 connections. No triangles here.
- Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has 1 connection, Node 4 has 3 connections. No triangles here.
- Edge (3, 7): Node 3 has 1 connection, Node 7 has 3 connections. No triangles here.
- Edge (4, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (4, 3): Already counted.
- Edge (5, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (5, 6): Node 5 has 4 connections, Node 6 has 3 connections. No triangles here.
- Edge (5, 7): Node 5 has 4 connections, Node 7 has 3 connections, and they share connections with Node 9, forming a triangle <5, 7, 9>.
- Edge (5, 9): Already counted.
- Edge (6, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (6, 5): Already counted.
- Edge (6, 8): Node 6 has 3 connections, Node 8 has 1 connection. No triangles here.
- Edge (7, 3): Already counted.
- Edge (7, 5): Already counted.
- Edge (7, 9): Already counted.
- Edge (8, 6): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 5): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 7): Already counted.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 5> and <5, 7, 9>.
