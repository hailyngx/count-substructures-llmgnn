Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeling:
- Node 5 with 2 connections -> relabeled as Node 0
- Node 7 with 2 connections -> relabeled as Node 1
- Node 4 with 4 connections -> relabeled as Node 2
- Node 6 with 4 connections -> relabeled as Node 3
- Node 1 with 5 connections -> relabeled as Node 4
- Node 2 with 5 connections -> relabeled as Node 5
- Node 9 with 5 connections -> relabeled as Node 6
- Node 8 with 6 connections -> relabeled as Node 7
- Node 3 with 7 connections -> relabeled as Node 8
- Node 0 with 8 connections -> relabeled as Node 9

By examining the edges based on the relabeled nodes, we find the following triangles:

<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
