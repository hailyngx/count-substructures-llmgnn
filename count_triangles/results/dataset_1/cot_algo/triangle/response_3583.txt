Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertices with their connections sorted are:
0: 1
1: 3, 4, 6
2: 4, 7
3: 1, 6, 8
4: 1, 2, 9
5: 8
6: 1, 3
7: 2
8: 3, 5, 9
9: 0, 4, 8

Now, we start counting the triangles:
For edge (0, 9): No triangles found.
For edge (1, 3): Triangle <1, 3, 6>.
For edge (1, 4): No triangles found.
For edge (1, 6): No additional triangles found.
For edge (2, 4): Triangle <2, 4, 9>.
For edge (2, 7): No additional triangles found.
For edge (3, 1): No additional triangles found.
For edge (3, 6): No additional triangles found.
For edge (3, 8): Triangle <3, 8, 5>.
For edge (4, 1): No additional triangles found.
For edge (4, 2): No additional triangles found.
For edge (4, 9): No additional triangles found.
For edge (5, 8): No additional triangles found.
For edge (6, 1): No additional triangles found.
For edge (6, 3): No additional triangles found.
For edge (7, 2): No additional triangles found.
For edge (8, 3): No additional triangles found.
For edge (8, 5): No additional triangles found.
For edge (8, 9): No additional triangles found.
For edge (9, 0): No additional triangles found.
For edge (9, 4): No additional triangles found.
For edge (9, 8): No additional triangles found.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 9>
