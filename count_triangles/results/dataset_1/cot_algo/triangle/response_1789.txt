Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The sorted order of vertices with their respective degrees is as follows:

Vertex 2 - Degree 2
Vertex 4 - Degree 2
Vertex 5 - Degree 3
Vertex 9 - Degree 2
Vertex 1 - Degree 2
Vertex 3 - Degree 3
Vertex 8 - Degree 3
Vertex 0 - Degree 4
Vertex 6 - Degree 4
Vertex 7 - Degree 4

Now, we will examine each edge in the order given:

Edge (0, 1): No triangles formed.
Edge (0, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 6>.
Edge (0, 7): Triangle <0, 7, 4>.
Edge (0, 8): Triangle <0, 8, 5>.
Edge (1, 0): No triangles formed.
Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
Edge (2, 9): No triangles formed.
Edge (3, 0): Triangle <3, 0, 7>.
Edge (3, 6): Triangle <3, 6, 7>.
Edge (4, 7): Triangle <4, 7, 0>.
Edge (4, 8): Triangle <4, 8, 0>.
Edge (5, 1): No triangles formed.
Edge (5, 6): Triangle <5, 6, 0>.
Edge (5, 8): Triangle <5, 8, 0>.
Edge (6, 2): No triangles formed.
Edge (6, 3): No triangles formed.
Edge (6, 5): Triangle <6, 5, 0>.
Edge (6, 7): Triangle <6, 7, 0>.
Edge (7, 0): No triangles formed.
Edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.
Edge (8, 0): No triangles formed.
Edge (8, 4): No triangles formed.
Edge (8, 5): No triangles formed.
Edge (9, 2): No triangles formed.
Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 6>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 8, 5>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 8, 0>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 8, 0>, and <6, 7, 0>.
