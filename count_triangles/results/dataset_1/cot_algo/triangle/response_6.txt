Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

Starting with the edges involving the nodes with the least connections:
(0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (3, 6), (1, 7), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 7), (5, 9), (8, 4).

Calculating the triangles formed by the shared connections:
(0, 1, 6), (0, 5, 7), (1, 6, 7), (2, 6, 7), (2, 6, 9), (4, 6, 8), (4, 6, 9), (5, 7, 9)

The total number of triangles is: [8]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>
