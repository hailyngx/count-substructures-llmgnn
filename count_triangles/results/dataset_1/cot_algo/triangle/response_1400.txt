Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will calculate the degree for each vertex:

- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 4

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:

- Vertex 1 (degree 2)
- Vertex 3 (degree 2)
- Vertex 4 (degree 2)
- Vertex 5 (degree 2)
- Vertex 9 (degree 4)
- Vertex 0 (degree 4)
- Vertex 2 (degree 3)
- Vertex 6 (degree 4)
- Vertex 8 (degree 2)

Now, we will follow the degree-based ordering method to count the triangles:

Considering edges only where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (1, 0) and (1, 4) share a connection with vertex 1 forming a triangle <1, 0, 4>.
2. (3, 2) and (3, 8) share a connection with vertex 3 forming a triangle <3, 2, 8>.
3. (4, 9) and (4, 1) share a connection with vertex 4 forming a triangle <4, 9, 1>.
4. (5, 6) and (5, 0) share a connection with vertex 5 forming a triangle <5, 6, 0>.
5. (9, 6) and (9, 0) share a connection with vertex 9 forming a triangle <9, 6, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
