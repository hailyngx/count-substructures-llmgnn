Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 1
- Vertex 10: degree 0

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Vertex 10 (degree 0) -> A
- Vertex 4 (degree 1) -> B
- Vertex 7 (degree 1) -> C
- Vertex 9 (degree 1) -> D
- Vertex 1 (degree 2) -> E
- Vertex 3 (degree 2) -> F
- Vertex 8 (degree 3) -> G
- Vertex 2 (degree 3) -> H
- Vertex 5 (degree 4) -> I
- Vertex 6 (degree 4) -> J

Now, we examine each edge based on the relabeled vertices:
- ED: D and H share no common connections.
- BA: A has no edges connecting to any other vertex.
- BC: C and I share no common connections.
- CE: E and H share one common connection (E -> I, H -> I) => <E, H, I>
- HF: F has no edges connecting to any other vertex.
- HG: G and H share one common connection (G -> I, H -> I) => <G, H, I>
- JI: I and J have two common connections (I: E, H; J: E, G) => <E, I, J>, <G, I, J>
- JB: B and J share no common connections.
- JC: C has no edges connecting to any other vertex.

Counting the triangles formed, we have found:
Total triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <E, H, I>, <G, H, I>, <E, I, J>
