Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

- Node 0 has 2 connections.
- Node 4 has 2 connections.
- Node 7 has 2 connections.
- Node 8 has 2 connections.
- Node 3 has 3 connections.
- Node 2 has 3 connections.
- Node 6 has 4 connections.
- Node 5 has 5 connections.
- Node 1 has 6 connections.
- Node 9 has 4 connections.

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will relabel the nodes as follows:
- Node 0 -> A
- Node 4 -> B
- Node 7 -> C
- Node 8 -> D
- Node 3 -> E
- Node 2 -> F
- Node 6 -> G
- Node 5 -> H
- Node 1 -> I
- Node 9 -> J

Now, we will check for triangles based on the ordering of the nodes:

1. For edge (A, I):
   - Node A has shared connections with nodes B and H.
   - Triangle: <A, B, H>

2. For edge (B, H):
   - Node B has shared connections with nodes H and C.
   - No new triangles formed.

3. For edge (B, D):
   - No new triangles formed.

4. For edge (D, J):
   - No new triangles formed.

5. For edge (E, J):
   - No new triangles formed.

6. For edge (F, H):
   - Node F has shared connections with nodes H and I.
   - No new triangles formed.

7. For edge (F, G):
   - Node F has shared connections with nodes G and H.
   - Triangle: <F, G, H>

8. For edge (G, H):
   - No new triangles formed.

9. For edge (H, I):
   - No new triangles formed.

10. For edge (H, J):
   - Node H has shared connections with nodes I and G.
   - No new triangles formed.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <A, B, H> and <F, G, H>.
