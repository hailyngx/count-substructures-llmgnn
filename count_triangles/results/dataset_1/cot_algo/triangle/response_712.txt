Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to list the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 6: degree 1
Vertex 9: degree 1
Vertex 4: degree 1
Vertex 1: degree 0
Vertex 7: degree 0
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 6

Now, we list the edges in decreasing order of the degrees of their vertices:

(6, 8) (9, 8) (4, 2) (0, 5) (2, 3) (8, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (8, 0)
(8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 3)

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method above, we can now count the number of triangles.

[Total number of triangles: 1]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 5>
