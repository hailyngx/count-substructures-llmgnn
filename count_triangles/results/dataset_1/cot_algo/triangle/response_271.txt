Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each vertex has:
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections

Sorting the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order:
Vertex 4, Vertex 0, Vertex 6, Vertex 7, Vertex 8, Vertex 1, Vertex 2, Vertex 3, Vertex 5

Now, we will examine each edge based on the degree-based ordering:

1. Edge (0, 5): Both vertices have different degrees, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 2, forming a triangle.
    
2. Edge (0, 7): Both vertices have different degrees, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 5, forming a triangle.
    
3. Edge (1, 2): Both vertices have different degrees, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 3, forming a triangle.
    
4. Edge (1, 3): Both vertices have different degrees, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 2, forming a triangle.
    
5. Edge (1, 6): Both vertices have different degrees, so we proceed.
    They do not share a connection.

6. Edge (2, 3): Both vertices have different degrees, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 1, forming a triangle.
    
7. Edge (2, 5): Both vertices have different degrees, so we proceed.
    They share connections with Vertex 3 and Vertex 0, forming two triangles.
    
8. Edge (3, 1): Vertex 1 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 2, forming a triangle.
    
9. Edge (3, 2): Vertex 2 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 1, forming a triangle.
    
10. Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 2, forming a triangle.
    
11. Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They do not share a connection.

12. Edge (4, 8): Both vertices have different degrees, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 3, forming a triangle.
    
13. Edge (5, 0): Vertex 0 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 2, forming a triangle.
    
14. Edge (5, 2): Vertex 2 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They share connections with Vertex 3 and Vertex 0, forming two triangles.
    
15. Edge (5, 3): Vertex 3 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 2, forming a triangle.
    
16. Edge (5, 6): Vertex 5 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They do not share a connection.
    
17. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 0, forming a triangle.
    
18. Edge (6, 1): Vertex 1 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They do not share a connection.
    
19. Edge (6, 5): Vertex 5 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They do not share a connection.
    
20. Edge (7, 0): Vertex 0 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 5, forming a triangle.
    
21. Edge (7, 5): Vertex 5 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 0, forming a triangle.
    
22. Edge (8, 3): Vertex 3 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They do not share a connection.
    
23. Edge (8, 4): Vertex 4 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    They share a connection with Vertex 3, forming a triangle.

Now, we count the total number of triangles formed: [10]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 5>
<4, 3, 8>
