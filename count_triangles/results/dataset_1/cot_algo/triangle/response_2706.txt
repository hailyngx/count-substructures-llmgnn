Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

The vertices labeled based on their degree are:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 4: 0 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 3: 4 connections

Checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (0, 3) forms a triangle with node 2: <0, 2, 3>
- (0, 5) does not form a triangle
- (0, 8) forms a triangle with node 6: <0, 6, 8>
- (1, 7) does not form a triangle
- (2, 3) forms a triangle with node 9: <2, 3, 9>
- (2, 9) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 2, 9>
- (3, 9) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 3, 9>
- (5, 0) does not form a triangle
- (5, 6) does not form a triangle
- (6, 8) does not form a triangle
- (6, 9) does not form a triangle
- (7, 1) does not form a triangle
- (8, 9) does not form a triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 9>.
