Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:  
Node 0 has 3 connections  
Node 1 has 1 connection  
Node 2 has 2 connections  
Node 3 has 3 connections  
Node 6 has 3 connections  
Node 7 has 3 connections  
Node 8 has 3 connections  
Node 9 has 2 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order: (1, 3), (2, 9), (0, 6), (3, 7), (8, 2), (8, 6).  
Calculating the triangles, we find the following:  
- Triangle <0, 3, 7>  
- Triangle <2, 8, 6>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
