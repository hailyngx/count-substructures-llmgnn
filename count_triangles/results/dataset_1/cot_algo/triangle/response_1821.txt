Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertex 0 has degree 3
Vertex 7 has degree 2
Vertex 8 has degree 1
Vertex 4 has degree 2
Vertex 6 has degree 3
Vertex 3 has degree 4
Vertex 2 has degree 3
Vertex 5 has degree 5
Vertex 1 has degree 6
Vertex 9 has degree 6

Now we relabel the vertices:

Vertex 8 (degree 1)  =>  Vertex 0
Vertex 7 (degree 2)  =>  Vertex 1
Vertex 4 (degree 2)  =>  Vertex 2
Vertex 0 (degree 3)  =>  Vertex 3
Vertex 6 (degree 3)  =>  Vertex 4
Vertex 2 (degree 3)  =>  Vertex 5
Vertex 5 (degree 5)  =>  Vertex 6
Vertex 3 (degree 4)  =>  Vertex 7
Vertex 1 (degree 6)  =>  Vertex 8
Vertex 9 (degree 6)  =>  Vertex 9

Now we will examine each edge based on the relabeled vertices:
 (3, 2)  (3, 6)  (4, 5)  (4, 6)  (4, 9)  (5, 1)  (5, 9)  (6, 9)  (7, 1)  (8, 2) 

We can count the triangles: 

1. <2, 4, 5>  
2. <4, 5, 6>  
3. <5, 1, 7>  
4. <5, 4, 6>  
5. <6, 4, 9>  
6. <9, 4, 6>  

Thus, there are 6 triangles in total, as indicated by [6].
