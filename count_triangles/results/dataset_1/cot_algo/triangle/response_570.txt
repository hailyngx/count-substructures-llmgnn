Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

0: 2 connections
5: 1 connection
7: 2 connections
9: 1 connection
3: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
8: 5 connections
2: 5 connections

Now, we consider the edges in the order given in the input, ensuring that we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(0, 2): Check shared connections {5} - Triangle <0, 2, 5>
(0, 5): No further triangles
(2, 7): No further triangles
(2, 8): Check shared connections {3, 4, 7} - Triangles <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 8>
(2, 9): No further triangles
(3, 4): No further triangles
(3, 8): No further triangles
(4, 8): No further triangles
(5, 0): No further triangles
(7, 2): No further triangles
(7, 8): No further triangles
(8, 3): No further triangles
(8, 4): No further triangles
(8, 7): No further triangles
(9, 2): No further triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, and <2, 7, 8>.
