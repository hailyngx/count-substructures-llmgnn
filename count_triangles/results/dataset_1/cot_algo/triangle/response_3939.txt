Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:
Vertices: 1, 7, 8 have 0 connections.
Vertices: 4, 5, 3 have 2 connections.
Vertices: 2, 8 have 3 connections.
Vertices: 0, 6 have 5 connections.
Vertex 9 has 6 connections.

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
1. (0, 4) - Both vertices have 5 connections. Not applicable.
2. (0, 5) - Vertex 0 has 5 connections and Vertex 5 has 4 connections. So, the shared connections (6) form a triangle <0, 5, 6>.
3. (0, 6) - Both vertices have 5 connections. Not applicable.
4. (0, 9) - Vertex 0 has 5 connections and Vertex 9 has 6 connections. So, the shared connections (4) form a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
5. (2, 5) - Both vertices have 3 connections. Not applicable.
6. (2, 6) - Vertex 2 has 3 connections and Vertex 6 has 5 connections. So, the shared connections (5) form a triangle <2, 5, 6>.
7. (2, 8) - Vertex 2 has 3 connections and Vertex 8 has 0 connections. Not applicable.
8. (3, 6) - Vertex 3 has 2 connections and Vertex 6 has 5 connections. So, the shared connections (9) form a triangle <3, 6, 9>.
9. (3, 9) - Vertex 3 has 2 connections and Vertex 9 has 6 connections. So, the shared connections (6) form a triangle <3, 6, 9>.
10. (4, 0) - Both vertices have 2 connections. Not applicable.
11. (4, 9) - Vertex 4 has 2 connections and Vertex 9 has 6 connections. So, the shared connections (0) form a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
12. (5, 0) - Vertex 5 has 4 connections and Vertex 0 has 5 connections. So, the shared connections (6) form a triangle <0, 5, 6>.
13. (5, 2) - Both vertices have 3 connections. Not applicable.
14. (5, 6) - Vertex 5 has 4 connections and Vertex 6 has 5 connections. So, the shared connections (0) form a triangle <0, 5, 6>.
15. (5, 7) - Vertex 5 has 4 connections and Vertex 7 has 0 connections. Not applicable.
16. (6, 0) - Both vertices have 5 connections. Not applicable.
17. (6, 2) - Vertex 2 has 3 connections and Vertex 6 has 5 connections. So, the shared connections (5) form a triangle <2, 5, 6>.
18. (6, 3) - Vertex 3 has 2 connections and Vertex 6 has 5 connections. So, the shared connections (9) form a triangle <3, 6, 9>.
19. (6, 5) - Vertex 5 has 4 connections and Vertex 6 has 5 connections. So, the shared connections (0) form a triangle <0, 5, 6>.
20. (6, 7) - Vertex 6 has 5 connections and Vertex 7 has 0 connections. Not applicable.
21. (6, 8) - Vertex 6 has 5 connections and Vertex 8 has 0 connections. Not applicable.
22. (6, 9) - Vertex 6 has 5 connections and Vertex 9 has 6 connections. So, the shared connections (3) form a triangle <3, 6, 9>.
23. (7, 5) - Vertex 7 has 0 connections and Vertex 5 has 4 connections. Not applicable.
24. (7, 6) - Vertex 7 has 0 connections and Vertex 6 has 5 connections. Not applicable.
25. (8, 2) - Vertex 8 has 0 connections and Vertex 2 has 3 connections. Not applicable.
26. (8, 6) - Vertex 8 has 0 connections and Vertex 6 has 5 connections. Not applicable.
27. (9, 0) - Vertex 9 has 6 connections and Vertex 0 has 5 connections. So, the shared connections (4) form a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
28. (9, 3) - Vertex 9 has 6 connections and Vertex 3 has 2 connections. So, the shared connections (6) form a triangle <3, 6, 9>.
29. (9, 4) - Vertex 9 has 6 connections and Vertex 4 has 2 connections. So, the shared connections (0) form a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
30. (9, 6) - Vertex 9 has 6 connections and Vertex 6 has 5 connections. So, the shared connections (3) form a triangle <3, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
