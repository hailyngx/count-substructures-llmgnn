Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labeling is as follows: 

Nodes: 
0 -> 3 connections 
1 -> 2 connections 
9 -> 2 connections 
7 -> 1 connection 
5 -> 3 connections 
8 -> 4 connections 
6 -> 3 connections 
2 -> 4 connections 
4 -> 4 connections 
3 -> 4 connections 

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now look at each edge to count the number of triangles.

Triangles:

[11]

Unique triangles: 
<2, 0, 4>
