Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices can be sorted based on their connections as follows:
Vertices: 8, 7, 9, 3, 6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 0

Now, we will count the triangles present in the graph:

1. For edge (0, 4): No triangles can be formed.
2. For edge (0, 5): Triangle <0, 4, 5> is found.
3. For edge (0, 6): No triangles can be formed.
4. For edge (0, 7): No triangles can be formed.
5. For edge (0, 9): Triangle <0, 5, 9> is found.
6. For edge (1, 2): No triangles can be formed.
7. For edge (1, 5): No triangles can be formed.
8. For edge (1, 8): No triangles can be formed.
9. For edge (2, 5): No triangles can be formed.
10. For edge (3, 4): No triangles can be formed.
11. For edge (3, 6): No triangles can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5> and <0, 5, 9>.
