Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted list of vertices with their respective connections is as follows:
(7: 1), (5: 1), (8: 1), (9: 2), (4: 3), (0: 4), (6: 4), (1: 5), (2: 5), (3: 0)

Now, we will examine each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections:
- (0, 2): 0, 1, 6
- (0, 6): 1, 2, 8
- (0, 8): 6, 9, 7
- (1, 2): 0, 6, 8
- (1, 5): No triangles
- (1, 6): 0, 2, 8
- (1, 9): 6, 8, 7
- (2, 0): 1, 6, 8
- (2, 1): 0, 6, 8
- (2, 6): 0, 1, 8
- (5, 1): No triangles
- (6, 0): 1, 2, 8
- (6, 1): 0, 2, 8
- (6, 2): 0, 1, 8
- (7, 9): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 8, 2>, <2, 0, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 1>, <6, 0, 1>, <6, 1, 8>, <6, 2, 0>.
