Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering helps us efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph.

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are as follows:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering, we proceed to count the triangles using the shared connections between vertices.

The total number of triangles is [18], and the unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
