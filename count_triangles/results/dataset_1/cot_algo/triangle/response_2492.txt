Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertices 1, 5, 6, 9: 3 connections
Vertices 7, 8: 4 connections
Vertices 2, 4: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- Starting with vertex 3 (2 connections):
No triangles can be formed since there are no edges with vertex 3.
- Moving to vertices with 3 connections:
- Vertex 1:
No triangles can be formed with vertex 1.
- Vertex 5:
No triangles can be formed with vertex 5.
- Vertex 6:
No triangles can be formed with vertex 6.
- Vertex 9:
No triangles can be formed with vertex 9.
- Moving to vertices with 4 connections:
- Vertex 7:
No triangles can be formed with vertex 7.
- Vertex 8:
No triangles can be formed with vertex 8.
- Moving to vertices with 5 connections:
- Vertex 2 (5 connections):
Checking edges (0, 2), (2, 8), and (5, 2), we find 1 triangle: <0, 2, 8>.
Checking edges (2, 0), (2, 6), and (5, 2), we find 1 triangle: <0, 2, 6>.
Checking edges (2, 0), (2, 8), and (5, 2), we find 1 triangle: <0, 2, 8>.
Checking edges (2, 6) and (2, 8), we find 1 triangle: <6, 2, 8>.
- Vertex 4 (5 connections):
Checking edges (0, 4), (4, 8), and (4, 9), we find 1 triangle: <0, 4, 8>.
Checking edges (4, 0), (4, 8), and (4, 9), we find 1 triangle: <0, 4, 8>.
Checking edges (0, 4), (4, 8), and (8, 3), we find 1 triangle: <0, 4, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 6>, <6, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 8>.
