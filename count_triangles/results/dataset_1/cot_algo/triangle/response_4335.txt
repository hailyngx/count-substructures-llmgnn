Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering is as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will analyze the edges that involve nodes with lower labels or fewer connections to find triangles. 

Triangles:
1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <3, 6, 4>
4. <3, 6, 9>
5. <4, 5, 9>
6. <5, 7, 9>
