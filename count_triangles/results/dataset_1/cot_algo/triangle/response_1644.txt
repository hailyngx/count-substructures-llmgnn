Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following order: 9, 1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 7, 2, 0, 8.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles and identify the unique triangles in the graph:

Number of triangles: [27]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 3>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 3, 7>.
