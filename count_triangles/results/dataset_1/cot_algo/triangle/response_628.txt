Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their degree:
- Vertex 0 has 3 connections
- Vertex 1 has 2 connections
- Vertex 4 has 2 connections
- Vertex 7 has 2 connections
- Vertex 6 has 3 connections
- Vertex 5 has 4 connections
- Vertex 8 has 4 connections
- Vertex 3 has 4 connections
- Vertex 9 has 3 connections
- Vertex 2 has 5 connections

We list the edges that satisfy the condition mentioned:
- (0, 1) forms triangle with 3 since they have a common connection with 4.
- (0, 3) forms triangle with 4 since they have a common connection with 2.
- (0, 4) forms triangle with 0 since they have a common connection with 2.
- (1, 3) forms triangle with 4 since they have a common connection with 0.
- (5, 6) forms triangle with 8 since they have a common connection with 8.
- (5, 8) forms triangle with 6 since they have a common connection with 6.
- (6, 7) forms triangle with 6 since they have a common connection with 8.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 6>, <6, 7, 8>.
