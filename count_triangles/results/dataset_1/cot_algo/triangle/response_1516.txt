Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degrees of each vertex:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 7
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes according to their degree:
- Node 1 (degree 2) -> Node A
- Node 2 (degree 2) -> Node B
- Node 5 (degree 2) -> Node C
- Node 0 (degree 3) -> Node D
- Node 3 (degree 3) -> Node E
- Node 8 (degree 3) -> Node F
- Node 7 (degree 4) -> Node G
- Node 4 (degree 4) -> Node H
- Node 9 (degree 4) -> Node I
- Node 6 (degree 7) -> Node J

Now, we will list the edges with the lower labeled vertex first:
(A, B), (A, G), (B, J), (B, E), (C, D), (D, B), (D, C), (D, J), (E, D), (E, J), (E, F), (F, E), (F, J), (F, I), (G, A), (G, F), (G, J), (G, I), (H, D), (H, E), (H, I), (I, H), (I, J)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the shared connections:
- Triangle <A, B, G>
- Triangle <D, E, J>
- Triangle <D, F, J>
- Triangle <G, F, J>
- Output: [4]
