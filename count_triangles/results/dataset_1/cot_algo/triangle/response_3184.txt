Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are as follows:
Vertices: 3, 9, 4, 2, 7, 5, 6, 1, 0, 8

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Starting with the edges:
(0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) 
(1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) 
(2, 5) 
(4, 0) 
(5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) 
(6, 0) 
(7, 0) 
(8, 0) 

Checking for shared connections to find triangles:

Triangle 1: <0, 1, 8>
Triangle 2: <0, 1, 9>
Triangle 3: <0, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
