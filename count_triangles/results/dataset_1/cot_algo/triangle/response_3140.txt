Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices should be relabeled as follows:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 1

With the relabeled vertices, we analyze the edges:

1. Edge (0, 4): Forms triangles with 5, 1, 6, 8.
2. Edge (0, 5): Does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 5): Does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 6): Forms a triangle with 4.
5. Edge (1, 8): Forms a triangle with 4.
6. Edge (3, 9): Does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (4, 0): Already counted.
8. Edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle with 1.
9. Edge (4, 7): Does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (4, 8): Forms a triangle with 1.
11. Edge (5, 0): Already counted.
12. Edge (5, 1): Already counted.
13. Edge (6, 1): Already counted.
14. Edge (6, 4): Already counted.
15. Edge (7, 4): Does not form a triangle.
16. Edge (8, 1): Already counted.
17. Edge (8, 4): Already counted.
18. Edge (9, 3): Does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 1>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 8, 4>.
