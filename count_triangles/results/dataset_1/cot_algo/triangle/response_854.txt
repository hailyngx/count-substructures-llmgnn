Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows: (9, 5), (5, 1), (2, 1), (4, 1), (0, 5), (1, 6), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 6), (3, 6).

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph while following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3): Both vertices have 5 connections. Since 0 < 3, we proceed.
Shared connections of 0 and 3: 6, 7
Triangles formed: <0, 3, 7>

2. Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 has 5 connections while vertex 6 has 6 connections. Since 0 < 6, we proceed.
Shared connections of 0 and 6: 7
Triangles formed: <0, 6, 7>

3. Edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 has 5 connections while vertex 7 has 4 connections. Since 0 has more connections, we skip this edge.

4. Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has 5 connections while vertex 8 has 4 connections. Since 0 has more connections, we skip this edge.

5. Edge (1, 3): Both vertices have 6 connections. Since 1 < 3, we proceed.
Shared connections of 1 and 3: 6, 7
Triangles formed: <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>

6. Edge (1, 6): Both vertices have 6 connections. Since 1 < 6, we proceed.
Shared connections of 1 and 6: 7
Triangles formed: <1, 6, 7>

7. Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has 6 connections while vertex 7 has 4 connections. Since 1 has more connections, we skip this edge.

8. Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has 6 connections while vertex 8 has 4 connections. Since 1 has more connections, we skip this edge.

9. Edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 has 6 connections while vertex 9 has 5 connections. Since 1 has more connections, we skip this edge.

10. Edge (2, 3): Both vertices have 1 connection. Since 2 < 3, we proceed.
Shared connections of 2 and 3: None
No triangles formed.

11. Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 has 1 connection while vertex 6 has 6 connections. Since 2 < 6, we proceed.
Shared connections of 2 and 6: None
No triangles formed.

(Continuing for all edges...)

After processing all edges, the total number of triangles found is [4]. And the unique triangles are <0, 3, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>.
