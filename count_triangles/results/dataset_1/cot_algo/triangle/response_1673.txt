Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Node 3 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 0, 5, and 9 have 2 connections.
- Nodes 4 and 6 have 3 connections.
- Nodes 1, 2, 7, and 8 have 4 connections.

Sorted vertices based on number of connections:
3 < 0, 5, 9 < 4, 6 < 1, 2, 7, 8

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
- For edge (0, 7):
  - Node 0 does not have fewer connections than node 7, so we cannot proceed.
- For edge (1, 2):
  - Node 1 has fewer connections than node 2, so we check for shared connections.
  - Shared connections: 7
  - Triangle: <1, 2, 7>
- For edge (1, 6):
  - Node 1 has fewer connections than node 6, so we check for shared connections.
  - No shared connections.
- For edge (1, 7):
  - Node 1 has fewer connections than node 7, so we check for shared connections.
  - Shared connections: 2
  - Triangle: <1, 2, 7>
- For edge (1, 8):
  - Node 1 has fewer connections than node 8, so we check for shared connections.
  - No shared connections.
- For edge (2, 7):
  - Node 2 has fewer connections than node 7, so we check for shared connections.
  - Shared connections: 1
  - Triangle: <1, 2, 7>
- For remaining edges, we don't have node pairs where the lower labeled node has fewer connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 7>.
