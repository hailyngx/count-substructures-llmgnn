Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). 

The sorted list of vertices with their degrees (connections) is as follows:
0: 4
2: 1
9: 1
4: 2
3: 3
8: 3
1: 4
7: 4
5: 5
6: 5

Now, we will check the edges based on the above ordering to count the number of triangles.

Triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [10]
