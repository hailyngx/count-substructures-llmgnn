Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: 
0: degree 2
2: degree 2
3: degree 2
4: degree 2
5: degree 2
7: degree 4
9: degree 4

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degree (from least to most connected):
0 → 0
2 → 1
3 → 2
4 → 3
5 → 4
7 → 5
9 → 6

Now, we look at each edge and calculate the number of triangles:

(0, 7): Both vertices have degree 4. Proceed.
0: {3, 5}
7: {0, 3, 9}
Shared connections: 3
Triangle: <0, 3, 7>

(2, 9): Both vertices have degree 2. Proceed.
1: {}
6: {}
No shared connections. No triangle.

(3, 7): Both vertices have degree 4. Proceed.
2: {0}
5: {0, 9}
Shared connections: 0
No triangle.

(4, 5): Both vertices have degree 2. Proceed.
3: {}
4: {}
No shared connections. No triangle.

(5, 4): Both vertices have degree 2. Proceed.
3: {}
4: {}
No shared connections. No triangle.

(7, 0): Both vertices have degree 4. Proceed.
0: {3, 5}
5: {0, 9}
Shared connections: 0
No triangle.

(7, 3): Both vertices have degree 4. Proceed.
2: {0}
5: {0, 9}
Shared connections: 0
No triangle.

(7, 9): Both vertices have degree 4. Proceed.
5: {0, 3}
6: {0}
Shared connections: 0
No triangle.

(9, 2): Both vertices have degree 2. Proceed.
1: {}
6: {}
No shared connections. No triangle.

(9, 7): Both vertices have degree 4. Proceed.
5: {0, 3}
6: {0}
Shared connections: 0
No triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1].
The unique triangle found is <0, 3, 7>.
