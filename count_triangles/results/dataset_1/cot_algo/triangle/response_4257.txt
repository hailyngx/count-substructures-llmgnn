Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the graph vertices is as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 0: 7 connections

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle <2, 8, 9>
- Triangle <4, 5, 9>
- Triangle <7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
