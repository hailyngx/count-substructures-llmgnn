Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 3 connections
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 3: 5 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their number of connections in increasing order:
- Vertex 0: relabeled as 2 (2 connections)
- Vertex 1: relabeled as 1 (3 connections)
- Vertex 2: relabeled as 4 (1 connection)
- Vertex 3: relabeled as 0 (5 connections)
- Vertex 4: relabeled as 3 (4 connections)
- Vertex 5: relabeled as 2 (2 connections)
- Vertex 6: relabeled as 0 (5 connections)
- Vertex 7: relabeled as 3 (4 connections)
- Vertex 8: relabeled as 4 (1 connection)
- Vertex 9: relabeled as 3 (4 connections)

Now, let's go through the edges based on the relabeled vertices:
- Edge (2, 0): Check for shared connections - None
- Edge (1, 0): Check for shared connections - None
- Edge (4, 2): Check for shared connections - None
- Edge (0, 3): Check for shared connections - Forms a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 3, 5>
- Edge (3, 1): Check for shared connections - Forms a triangle with vertex 6: <1, 3, 6>
- Edge (3, 5): Check for shared connections - Forms a triangle with vertex 6: <3, 5, 6>
- Edge (7, 4): Check for shared connections - None
- Edge (3, 6): Check for shared connections - Forms a triangle with vertex 9: <3, 6, 9>
- Edge (9, 7): Check for shared connections - Forms a triangle with vertex 4: <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, and <4, 7, 9>.
