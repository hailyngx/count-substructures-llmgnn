Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new order is:
Nodes with their corresponding new labels:
0 - 1
1 - 5
3 - 2
4 - 3
5 - 6
6 - 7
7 - 8
8 - 9
9 - 4
2 - 0

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
For each edge, we only consider it if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Examining the edges:
(0, 2): Check shared connections - Forms triangle with 3 and 4 <0, 2, 3> and <0, 2, 4>
(0, 3): Check shared connections - No additional triangles
(0, 4): Check shared connections - No additional triangles
(1, 4): Ignored since vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 4
(2, 5): Check shared connections - No additional triangles
(2, 6): Check shared connections - No additional triangles
(2, 7): Check shared connections - Forms triangle with 6 and 8 <2, 7, 6>
(2, 8): Check shared connections - No additional triangles
(2, 9): Check shared connections - No additional triangles
(3, 8): Check shared connections - No additional triangles
(4, 7): Check shared connections - No additional triangles
(5, 9): Check shared connections - No additional triangles
(6, 8): Check shared connections - No additional triangles

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>
