Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of connections for each vertex:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 8: 4 connections

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their number of connections (from least to most):
- Node 7 (1 connection)
- Node 1 (2 connections)
- Node 3 (2 connections)
- Node 0 (3 connections)
- Node 2 (3 connections)
- Node 5 (3 connections)
- Node 8 (4 connections)
- Node 6 (4 connections)

We will now list the edges based on the new vertex labels and count the number of triangles:
- Edge (7, 8): Check shared connections {8}
- Edge (1, 2): Check shared connections {2}
- Edge (1, 6): Check shared connections {1, 6}
- Edge (3, 2): Check shared connections {2}
- Edge (0, 6): Check shared connections {6}
- Edge (3, 5): Check shared connections {3, 5}
- Edge (5, 6): Check shared connections {6}
- Edge (5, 8): Check shared connections {8}
- Edge (8, 0): Check shared connections {8, 0}
- Edge (8, 7): Check shared connections {8}

Hence, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 6, 5>, <0, 8, 5>, and <1, 6, 5>.
