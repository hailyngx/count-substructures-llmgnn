Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

Nodes sorted based on their degree (number of connections):
Nodes: 3, 5, 8, 9, 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 4

Now, we will count the triangles using the sorted nodes and provided edges:

1. Edge (0, 2):
    - Shared connections with 0: 3
    - Shared connections with 2: 4, 6
    - Triangle: <0, 2, 4>

2. Edge (0, 3):
    - Shared connection: None
    - No triangle found

3. Edge (1, 4):
    - Shared connections with 1: 7, 8
    - Shared connections with 4: 2, 6, 7, 9
    - Triangles: <1, 4, 7>

4. Edge (1, 7):
    - Shared connection: None
    - No triangle found

5. Edge (1, 8):
    - Shared connection: None
    - No triangle found

6. Edge (2, 4):
    - Shared connections with 2: 0, 5, 6
    - Shared connections with 4: 1, 6, 7, 9
    - Triangle: <2, 4, 6>

7. Edge (2, 5):
    - Shared connection: None
    - No triangle found

8. Edge (2, 6):
    - Shared connections with 2: 4
    - Shared connections with 6: 4, 7
    - Triangle: <2, 6, 7>

9. Edge (3, 0):
    - Shared connection: None
    - No triangle found

10. Edge (4, 1):
    - Shared connections with 1: 7, 8
    - Shared connections with 4: 2, 6, 7, 9
    - Triangles: <1, 4, 7>

11. Edge (4, 6):
    - Shared connections with 4: 2, 6, 7, 9
    - Shared connections with 6: 2, 7
    - Triangle: <4, 6, 7>

12. Edge (4, 7):
    - Shared connections with 4: 1, 2, 6, 9
    - Shared connections with 7: 1, 6
    - Triangle: <1, 4, 7>

13. Edge (4, 9):
    - Shared connection: None
    - No triangle found

14. Edge (5, 2):
    - Shared connection: None
    - No triangle found

15. Edge (6, 2):
    - Shared connections with 2: 4
    - Shared connections with 6: 4, 7
    - Triangle: <2, 6, 7>

16. Edge (6, 4):
    - Shared connections with 4: 2, 6, 7, 9

    - Triangle: <4, 6, 7>

17. Edge (6, 7):
    - Shared connections with 6: 2, 4
    - Shared connections with 7: 1, 4
    - Triangle: <2, 6, 7>

18. Edge (7, 1):
    - Shared connection: None
    - No triangle found

19. Edge (7, 4):
    - Shared connections with 4: 1, 2, 6, 9
