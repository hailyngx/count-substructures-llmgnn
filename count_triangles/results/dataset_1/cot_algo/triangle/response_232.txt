Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertices 7 and 5: 2 connections each
Vertices 4 and 6: 3 connections each
Vertices 1, 2, and 3: 4 connections each
Vertex 0: 8 connections
Vertex 8: 8 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their connections:

Vertex 1: 0 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertices 7 and 5: 2 connections each
Vertices 4 and 6: 3 connections each
Vertices 2 and 3: 4 connections each
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

For edge (0, 2):
Since 0 has 5 connections and 2 has 4 connections, we proceed.
Shared connections: 3, 4
Triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>

For edge (0, 3):
Since 0 has 5 connections and 3 has 4 connections, we proceed.
Shared connections: 2, 4, 5
Triangles: <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>

For other edges, we find more triangles similarly:
(0, 4): <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 7>
(0, 5): <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 6>
(0, 6): <0, 6, 5>
(0, 7): <0, 7, 4>
(0, 8): <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 2>

Adding up all the triangles, we have:
