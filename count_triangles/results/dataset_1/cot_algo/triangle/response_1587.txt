Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we relabel the vertices as follows: 
Node 1: 1 connection - Node 1
Node 0: 2 connections - Node 0
Node 8: 2 connections - Node 2
Node 9: 2 connections - Node 3
Node 4: 3 connections - Node 4
Node 7: 3 connections - Node 5
Node 6: 3 connections - Node 6
Node 3: 4 connections - Node 7
Node 2: 4 connections - Node 8
Node 5: 4 connections - Node 9

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method with the relabeled vertices, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <3, 7, 2>
2. Triangle <3, 6, 2>
3. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
5. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
6. Triangle <4, 5, 7>
7. Triangle <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
