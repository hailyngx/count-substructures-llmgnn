Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently.

First, let's list the vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Vertices: 7, 4, 9, 0, 3, 5, 8, 2, 1, 6

Next, we will relabel the vertices according to this ordering:
0 -> 7
1 -> 4
2 -> 9
3 -> 0
4 -> 3
5 -> 5
6 -> 8
7 -> 2
8 -> 1
9 -> 6

Now, traverse the edges to count triangles:
Triangles: [25]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
