Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 7), (0, 3), (4, 5), (6, 9), (8, 2), (4, 6), (1, 5), (5, 6), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 8), (5, 4), (6, 5)

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <1, 2, 3>.
