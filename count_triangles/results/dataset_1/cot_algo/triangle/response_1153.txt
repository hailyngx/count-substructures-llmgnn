Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After arranging the nodes in descending order of their connections, the new labels for each node will be as follows:
- Node 0 (degree 4)
- Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 3 (degree 2)
- Node 4 (degree 4)
- Node 5 (degree 2)
- Node 6 (degree 3)
- Node 7 (degree 2)
- Node 8 (degree 4)
- Node 9 (degree 4)

Using the given edges and the degree-based ordering method, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 2, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
