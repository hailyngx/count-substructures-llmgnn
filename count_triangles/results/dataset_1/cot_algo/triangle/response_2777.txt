Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 0 has 3 connections
- Node 1 has 3 connections
- Node 7 has 3 connections
- Node 8 has 2 connections
- Node 5 has 4 connections
- Node 4 has 4 connections
- Node 9 has 5 connections
- Node 2 has 5 connections
- Node 3 has 5 connections
- Node 6 has 8 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will count the triangles. 

Triangles:
1. <0, 5, 8>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <0, 6, 9>
5. <1, 4, 6>
6. <1, 6, 7>
7. <2, 3, 6>
8. <2, 3, 9>
9. <2, 6, 9>
10. <3, 6, 9>
11. <4, 6, 9>
12. <5, 8, 9>
13. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
