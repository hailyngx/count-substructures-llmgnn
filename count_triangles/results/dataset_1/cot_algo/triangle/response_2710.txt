Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the reordered list of nodes is: 
Nodes: 1, 7, 0, 5, 6, 4, 8, 2, 9, 3

Using this ordering, we can count the triangles:
Triangles: [9]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<1, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
