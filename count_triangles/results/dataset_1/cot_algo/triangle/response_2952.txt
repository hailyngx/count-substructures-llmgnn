Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we get the following labels:
Vertices: (0, 6) (7) (3, 4) (5) (1, 2, 8, 9)

Using Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:
- Edge (0, 1) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 2, 7, 8
- Edge (0, 2) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 4, 8
- Edge (0, 7) -> Not proceeding as 0 has more connections than 7
- Edge (0, 8) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 1, 2, 5 -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>
- Edge (1, 4) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 2
- Edge (1, 6) -> Not proceeding as 1 has more connections than 6
- Edge (1, 8) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 0, 2, 5 -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>
- Edge (1, 9) -> Not proceeding as 1 has more connections than 9
- Edge (2, 3) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 5, 9
- Edge (2, 4) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 1
- Edge (2, 5) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 3, 8, 9 -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>
- Edge (2, 9) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 1, 3 -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>
- Edge (3, 5) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 2, 9
- Edge (3, 9) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 2, 5 -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>
- Edge (4, 1) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 2
- Edge (5, 2) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 3, 8, 9 -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>
- Edge (5, 3) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 2, 9
- Edge (5, 8) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 0, 2, 9 -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>
- Edge (5, 9) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 2, 3 -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>
- Edge (6, 1) -> Not proceeding as 1 has more connections than 6
- Edge (8, 0) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 1, 2, 5 -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>
- Edge (8, 1) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 0, 2, 5 -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>
- Edge (8, 5) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 0, 2, 9 -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>
- Edge (8, 9) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 2, 5 -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>
- Edge (9, 1) -> Not proceeding as 1 has more connections than 9
- Edge (9, 2) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 1, 3 -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>
- Edge (9, 3) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 2, 5 -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>
- Edge (9, 5) -> Proceed
  Shared connections: 2, 3 -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <0, 2, 8>
