Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the relabeled vertices are as follows:
Node 3 has 1 connection
Node 5 has 1 connections
Node 6 has 2 connections
Node 8 has 2 connections
Node 1 has 4 connections
Node 7 has 4 connections
Node 2 has 4 connections
Node 0 has 6 connections
Node 9 has 6 connections
Node 4 has 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. The triangles found are:

<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
