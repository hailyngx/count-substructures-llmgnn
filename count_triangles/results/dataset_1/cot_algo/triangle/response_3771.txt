Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices should be relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 9: Degree 4

Edges to consider following the method:
(0, 5) - Shared connections: {1, 4}
(0, 6) - No triangle
(1, 2) - No triangle
(1, 5) - Shared connections: {0, 4}
(1, 9) - Shared connections: {4, 7}
(2, 3) - No triangle
(4, 5) - Shared connections: {0, 1}
(4, 8) - No triangle
(4, 9) - Shared connections: {1, 7}
(5, 6) - No triangle
(6, 7) - Shared connections: {1, 9}
(7, 9) - Shared connections: {1, 4}

Count of triangles in the graph: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 0>, <4, 7, 9>
