Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are: 
Vertex 3 (Degree 1)
Vertex 4 (Degree 0)
Vertex 5 (Degree 2)
Vertex 0 (Degree 3)
Vertex 1 (Degree 2)
Vertex 6 (Degree 2)
Vertex 9 (Degree 2)
Vertex 7 (Degree 4)
Vertex 2 (Degree 4)
Vertex 8 (Degree 5)

Now, we will count the triangles:

- Triangle <0, 2, 8> (Shared connections: 7)
- Triangle <0, 5, 9> (Shared connections: None)
- Triangle <1, 6, 9> (Shared connections: None)
- Triangle <1, 7, 2> (Shared connections: None)
- Triangle <2, 7, 8> (Shared connections: None)
- Triangle <2, 7, 8> (Shared connections: None)

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
