Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees:
   - Node 7: degree 1
   - Node 5: degree 2
   - Node 4: degree 2
   - Node 1: degree 3
   - Node 8: degree 3
   - Node 6: degree 4
   - Node 3: degree 4
   - Node 0: degree 4
   - Node 9: degree 6
   - Node 2: degree 6

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
   - Node 7 (degree 1) -> Node A
   - Node 5 (degree 2) -> Node B
   - Node 4 (degree 2) -> Node C
   - Node 1 (degree 3) -> Node D
   - Node 8 (degree 3) -> Node E
   - Node 6 (degree 4) -> Node F
   - Node 3 (degree 4) -> Node G
   - Node 0 (degree 4) -> Node H
   - Node 9 (degree 6) -> Node I
   - Node 2 (degree 6) -> Node J

3. Go through each edge based on the order of the vertices to count triangles:
   - <A, B, J>
   - <A, C, J>
   - <B, C, J>
   - <H, I, J>
   - <F, G, J>
   - <G, J, E>
   - <F, G, I>
   - <D, B, J>
   - <D, B, G>
   - <D, J, I>
   - <D, F, G>
   - <H, F, J>
   - <H, F, G>
   - <H, J, I>
   - <H, G, E>
   - <G, I, E>

4. The total number of triangles in the graph is [15].

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph, as identified above.
