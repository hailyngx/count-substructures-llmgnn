Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:
Vertices: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 9-10

The updated graph based on the new labeling:
(1-3), (1-7), (2-5), (3-5), (4-6), (5-5), (5-8), (6-4), (7-3), (9-2)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[Total number of triangles: 3]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 5>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 4>
