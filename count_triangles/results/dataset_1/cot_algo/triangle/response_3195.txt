Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order.

Sorted list of vertices based on degree:
0 (degree 3)
4 (degree 1)
7 (degree 1)
6 (degree 2)
8 (degree 4)
3 (degree 4)
5 (degree 0)
1 (degree 0)
2 (degree 4)
9 (degree 7)

Now, we go through each edge while making sure the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Checking edges with respective triangles formed:
(0, 2) - None
(0, 3) - None
(0, 9) - <0, 3, 9>
(2, 7) - None
(2, 8) - <2, 3, 8>
(2, 9) - <2, 0, 9>
(3, 6) - None
(3, 8) - <3, 2, 8>
(3, 9) - <3, 0, 9>
(6, 9) - <6, 3, 9>
(8, 9) - <8, 2, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 0, 9>, <3, 0, 9>, <6, 3, 9>
