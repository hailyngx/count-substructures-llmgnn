Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeling:
Vertex 1 has 1 connection
Vertex 3 has 1 connection
Vertex 5 has 2 connections
Vertex 4 has 3 connections
Vertex 9 has 4 connections
Vertex 2 has 4 connections
Vertex 6 has 5 connections
Vertex 0 has 6 connections
Vertex 8 has 6 connections
Vertex 7 has 6 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles by considering edges in the order given:

1. Edge (0, 4): No triangles formed.
2. Edge (0, 6): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (0, 7): Triangle <0, 6, 7> found.
4. Edge (0, 8): Triangle <0, 6, 8> found.
5. Edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (2, 7): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (2, 9): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (4, 0): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (5, 6): Triangle <5, 6, 0> found.
15. Edge (6, 0): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (6, 5): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (6, 7): Triangle <6, 0, 7> found.
18. Edge (6, 8): No triangles formed.
19. Edge (7, 0): No triangles formed.
20. Edge (7, 2): No triangles formed.
21. Edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
22. Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
23. Edge (8, 0): No triangles formed.
24. Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed.
25. Edge (8, 6): No triangles formed.
26. Edge (8, 9): No triangles formed.
27. Edge (9, 1): No triangles formed.
28. Edge (9, 2): No triangles formed.
29. Edge (9, 3): No triangles formed.
30. Edge (9, 8): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <0, 6, 7> and <5, 6, 0>.
