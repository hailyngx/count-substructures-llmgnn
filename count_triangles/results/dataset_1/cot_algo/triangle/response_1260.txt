Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted order of vertices is: 3, 9, 6, 8, 1, 5, 7, 0, 2, 4.

Now, let's count the triangles:

- Node 3 and Node 9 have no common neighbors, so no triangle.
- Node 9 and Node 6 have one common neighbor, forming a triangle with Node 8. <6, 8, 9>
- Node 6 and Node 8 have one common neighbor, forming a triangle with Node 9. This triangle has already been counted.
- Node 8 and Node 1 have no common neighbors, so no triangle.
- Node 1 and Node 5 have one common neighbor, forming a triangle with Node 4. <1, 4, 5>
- Node 5 and Node 7 have one common neighbor, forming a triangle with Node 0. <0, 5, 7>
- Node 7 and Node 0 have one common neighbor, forming a triangle with Node 4. This triangle has already been counted.
- Node 0 and Node 2 have two common neighbors, forming two triangles: <0, 2, 4> and <0, 2, 7>.
- Node 2 and Node 4 have four common neighbors, forming four triangles: <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, and <2, 4, 1>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
