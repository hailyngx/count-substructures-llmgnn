Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices by degree:
1. Node 8: Degree 1
2. Node 3: Degree 2
3. Node 2: Degree 3
4. Node 5: Degree 3
5. Node 0: Degree 4
6. Node 8: Degree 4
7. Node 4: Degree 4
8. Node 1: Degree 5
9. Node 7: Degree 5
10. Node 9: Degree 7

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles []: [4]

Unique triangles <>
<4, 6, 9>
<7, 1, 5>
<7, 1, 9>
<9, 3, 4>
