Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertex 9: 0 connections
Vertex 7: 0 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections

Now, we start checking for triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2):
   - Shared connections: 0
   - Triangles: None
2. Edge (0, 3):
   - Shared connections: 0
   - Triangles: None
3. Edge (0, 4):
   - Shared connections: None
   - Triangles: None
4. Edge (0, 5):
   - Shared connections: None
   - Triangles: None
5. Edge (1, 3):
   - Shared connections: 3
   - Triangles: <0, 1, 3>
6. Edge (1, 7):
   - Shared connections: None
   - Triangles: None
7. Edge (2, 0):
   - Skipped as 0 has more connections than 2
8. Edge (2, 6):
   - Shared connections: 2
   - Triangles: <0, 2, 6>
9. Edge (3, 0):
   - Skipped as 0 has more connections than 3
10. Edge (3, 1):
   - Shared connections: 3
   - Triangles: <0, 1, 3>
11. Edge (4, 0):
   - Skipped as 0 has more connections than 4
12. Edge (4, 8):
   - Shared connections: 4
   - Triangles: <0, 4, 8>
13. Edge (5, 0):
   - Skipped as 0 has more connections than 5
14. Edge (6, 2):
   - Shared connections: 2
   - Triangles: None
15. Edge (7, 1):
   - Shared connections: None
   - Triangles: None
16. Edge (8, 4):
   - Shared connections: 4
   - Triangles: None

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 8>
