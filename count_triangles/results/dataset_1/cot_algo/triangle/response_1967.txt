Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 7 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles and list them:
[Number of triangles: 6]
<5, 8, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 6>
<5, 8, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
