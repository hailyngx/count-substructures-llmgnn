Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 1
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 5
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 9: Degree 5

Now, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle with Node 9
- Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle with Node 9
- Edge (1, 6): Forms a triangle with Node 4
- Edge (1, 7): Forms a triangle with Node 9
- Edge (1, 9): Forms a triangle with Nodes 3 and 5
- Edge (2, 4): Forms a triangle with Node 6
- Edge (2, 6): Forms a triangle with Nodes 1 and 4
- Edge (3, 9): Forms a triangle with Node 5
- Edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle with Nodes 2 and 1
- Edge (5, 9): Forms a triangle with Node 1
- Edge (6, 7): Forms a triangle with Node 1

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph, which are <0, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 1, 6>, <3, 1, 9>, <4, 6, 1>, <5, 1, 9>, and <6, 1, 7>.
