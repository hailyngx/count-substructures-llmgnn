Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by the number of connections they have are:  

Vertex 9 (degree 1): 1 connection  
Vertex 2 (degree 2): 2 connections  
Vertex 0 (degree 3): 3 connections  
Vertex 5 (degree 2): 2 connections  
Vertex 9 (degree 1): 1 connection  
Vertex 2 (degree 4): 4 connections  
Vertex 3 (degree 5): 5 connections  
Vertex 6 (degree 3): 3 connections  
Vertex 7 (degree 4): 4 connections  
Vertex 8 (degree 6): 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the following edges:  
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 8), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8)  

Counting the triangles formed by these edges, we find:  
[Total number of triangles: 10]  

Unique triangles found:  
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 1, 6>  
<0, 1, 7>  
<0, 1, 8>  
<0, 4, 3>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<2, 3, 4>  
<3, 4, 8>  
<6, 7, 8>  
<1, 6, 7>
