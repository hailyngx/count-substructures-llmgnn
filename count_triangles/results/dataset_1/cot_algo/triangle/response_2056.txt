Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are: 

Node 3 (Degree 1)
Node 5 (Degree 2)
Node 8 (Degree 2)
Node 6 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 4)
Node 2 (Degree 4)
Node 7 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 5)
Node 9 (Degree 5)
Node 4 (Degree 6)

Next, by following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check the edges in the order specified. Since we are checking in the edge order and only considering cases where the lower labeled node has fewer connections, we will end up counting each triangle once. 

After checking all the edges, and counting the triangles, we find:
Total number of triangles: [6]

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 6.
