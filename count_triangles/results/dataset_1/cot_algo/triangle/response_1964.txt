Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees:

1. Vertex 1 - Degree 1
2. Vertex 2 - Degree 1
3. Vertex 4 - Degree 1
4. Vertex 7 - Degree 1
5. Vertex 3 - Degree 2
6. Vertex 8 - Degree 4
7. Vertex 6 - Degree 4
8. Vertex 9 - Degree 5
9. Vertex 5 - Degree 5
10. Vertex 0 - Degree 5

Now, we will count the number of triangles by considering each edge and checking for shared connections. Since the vertex with the lower label should have fewer connections, we will only analyze edges where this condition is satisfied.

By following this method, we find that there are:
- 11 triangles in total, which can be represented as [11]
- The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 9, 1>, <8, 6, 9>, <9, 7, 1>
