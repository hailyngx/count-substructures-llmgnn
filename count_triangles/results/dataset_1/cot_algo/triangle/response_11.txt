Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. First, we need to sort the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:

Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 7 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 6 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections

Now, relabel the vertices based on their sorted order:

Vertices: 2, 7, 4, 9, 3, 5, 0, 1, 8, 6

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 1): No triangle
2. Edge (0, 3): No triangle
3. Edge (0, 4): No triangle
4. Edge (0, 7): No triangle
5. Edge (0, 8): No triangle
6. Edge (1, 2): No triangle
7. Edge (1, 5): No triangle
8. Edge (1, 6): No triangle
9. Edge (1, 9): Triangle formed by vertices 1, 5, 9
10. Edge (2, 6): No triangle
11. Edge (3, 6): No triangle
12. Edge (3, 8): No triangle
13. Edge (4, 8): No triangle
14. Edge (5, 6): No triangle
15. Edge (5, 8): Triangle formed by vertices 5, 1, 8
16. Edge (6, 7): No triangle
17. Edge (6, 8): No triangle
18. Edge (6, 9): No triangle

Count of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles: <1, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 8>
