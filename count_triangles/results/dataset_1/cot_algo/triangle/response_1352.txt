Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex in the graph:

- Vertex 0: 2 edges (degree 2)
- Vertex 1: 1 edge (degree 1)
- Vertex 2: 4 edges (degree 4)
- Vertex 3: 5 edges (degree 5)
- Vertex 4: 2 edges (degree 2)
- Vertex 5: 3 edges (degree 3)
- Vertex 6: 1 edge (degree 1)
- Vertex 8: 3 edges (degree 3)
- Vertex 9: 3 edges (degree 3)

Using degree-based ordering, we relabel the vertices as follows:
- Vertex 1 (degree 1) -> relabel as 0
- Vertex 6 (degree 1) -> relabel as 1
- Vertex 4 (degree 2) -> relabel as 2
- Vertex 0 (degree 2) -> relabel as 3
- Vertex 8 (degree 3) -> relabel as 4
- Vertex 5 (degree 3) -> relabel as 5
- Vertex 9 (degree 3) -> relabel as 6
- Vertex 3 (degree 5) -> relabel as 7
- Vertex 2 (degree 4) -> relabel as 8

Now, let's analyze the edges based on the new labels:
- Edge (1, 2): Both vertices have degree less than 4, proceed.
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 6): Both vertices have degree less than 1, do not proceed.
- Edge (2, 0): Vertex 2 has degree less than 2, proceed.
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 has degree less than 5, proceed.
    - Shared connections: Vertex 0
- Edge (2, 5): Vertex 2 has degree less than 3, proceed.
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 has degree less than 3, proceed.
    - Shared connections: Vertex 2
- Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 has degree greater than 3, do not proceed.
- Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 has degree greater than 3, do not proceed.
- Edge (4, 5): Both vertices have degree less than 3, proceed.
    - Shared connections: None
- Edge (5, 3): Vertex 5 has degree less than 5, proceed.
    - Shared connections: Vertex 3
- Edge (8, 9): Both vertices have degree less than 3, proceed.
    - Shared connections: None
