Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 2: 7 connections
Node 4: 7 connections
Node 8: 8 connections
Node 5: 9 connections

Now, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 5): Both nodes have 6 connections. They share connections with 3 (Triangle: <0, 5, 3>).
2. Edge (0, 6): Node 0 has 6 connections (lower label). Node 6 has 6 connections. They share a connection with node 4 (Triangle: <0, 6, 4>).
3. Edge (1, 4): Both nodes have 5 connections. They share a connection with node 8 (Triangle: <1, 4, 8>).
4. Edge (2, 3): Both nodes have 7 connections. They share a connection with nodes 5 and 8 (Triangles: <2, 3, 5> and <2, 3, 8>).
5. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 has 7 connections (lower label). Node 4 has 7 connections. They share connections with nodes 1, 6, and 8 (Triangles: <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 6>, and <2, 4, 8>).
6. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 has 7 connections (lower label). Node 7 has 6 connections. They share a connection with node 4 (Triangle: <2, 7, 4>).
7. Edge (2, 8): Node 2 has 7 connections (lower label). Node 8 has 8 connections. They share connections with nodes 1, 3, 4, and 7 (Triangles: <2, 8, 1>, <2, 8, 3>, <2, 8, 4>, and <2, 8, 7>).
8. Edge (3, 2): Node 3 has 5 connections (lower label). Node 2 has 7 connections. They share connections with nodes 4 and 8 (Triangles: <3, 2, 4> and <3, 2, 8>).
9. Edge (3, 5): Node 3 has 5 connections (lower label). Node 5 has 9 connections. They share a connection with node 0 (Triangle: <3, 5, 0>).
10. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 has 5 connections (lower label). Node 8 has 8 connections. They share a connection with node 2 (Triangle: <3, 8, 2>).
11. Edge (4, 1): Node 4 has 7 connections (lower label). Node 1 has 5 connections. They share a connection with node 8 (Triangle: <4, 1, 8>).
12. Edge (4, 2): We already considered this edge with triangle <2, 4, 1>.
13. Edge (4, 6): We already considered this edge with triangle <0, 6, 4>.
14. Edge (4, 7): We already considered this edge with triangle <2, 7, 4>.
15. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 has 7 connections (lower label). Node 8 has 8 connections. They share a connection with node 2 (Triangle: <4, 8, 2>).
16. Edge (5, 0): We already considered this edge with triangle <0, 5, 3>.
17. Edge (5, 3): We already considered this edge with triangle <3, 5, 0>.
18. Edge (6, 0): We already considered this edge with triangle <0, 6, 4>.
19. Edge (6, 4): We already considered this edge with triangle <0, 6, 4>.
20. Edge (7, 2): We already considered this edge with triangle <2, 7, 4>.
21. Edge (7, 4): We already considered this edge with triangle <2, 7, 4>.
22. Edge (7, 8): We already considered this edge with triangle <2, 8, 7>.
23. Edge (8, 1): We already considered this edge with triangle <1, 4, 8>.
24. Edge (8, 2): We already considered this edge with triangle <2, 8, 1>.
25. Edge (8, 3): We already considered this edge with triangle <3, 8, 2>.
26. Edge (8, 4): We already considered this edge with triangle <4, 8, 2>.
27. Edge (8, 7): We already considered this edge with triangle <2, 8, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
