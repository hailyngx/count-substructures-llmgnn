Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their degree:
Node 0 - 2 edges
Node 5 - 2 edges
Node 9 - 2 edges
Node 7 - 3 edges
Node 6 - 3 edges
Node 2 - 3 edges
Node 4 - 4 edges
Node 1 - 5 edges
Node 3 - 5 edges
Node 8 - 6 edges
