Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
0: 3 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 1 connection
7: 3 connections
8: 0 connections
1: 5 connections
2: 4 connections
5: 5 connections
6: 4 connections
9: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 -> 0
3 -> 1
4 -> 2
7 -> 3
8 -> 4
1 -> 5
2 -> 6
5 -> 7
6 -> 8
9 -> 9

Following the rule of only proceeding if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can identify the triangles and count them:

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
