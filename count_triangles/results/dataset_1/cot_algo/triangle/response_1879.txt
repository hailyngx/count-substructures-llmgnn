Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following sequence: 1, 3, 5, 9, 6, 4, 7, 2, 8, 0.

Using this ordering, we find the triangles and count them:
- Vertex 1: No triangle
- Vertex 3: No triangle
- Vertex 5: No triangle
- Vertex 9: No triangle
- Vertex 6: <0, 6, 7>
- Vertex 4: <4, 7, 5>
- Vertex 7: No triangle
- Vertex 2: No triangle
- Vertex 8: <0, 8, 1> and <0, 8, 5>

Count of triangles: [3]
