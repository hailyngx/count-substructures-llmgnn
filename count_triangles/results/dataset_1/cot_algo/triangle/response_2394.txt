Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections we have: 

Vertices: 8, 4, 5, 0, 8, 3, 1, 2, 9, 10

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph.

The triangles in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 9, 2>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 7, 1>, <9, 1, 0>, <9, 2, 0>, <9, 3, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
