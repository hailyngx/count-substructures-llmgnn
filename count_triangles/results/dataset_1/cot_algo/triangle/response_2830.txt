Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on the number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices and their connections:
```
0: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
4: 1 connection
6: 2 connections
5: 3 connections
2: 2 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 5 connections
```
Now, we will go through the edges in the order given, only considering edges where the lower label vertex has fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 8): Shared connection with vertex 2 forms triangle <0, 2, 8>.
2. Edge (0, 9): Shared connection with vertices 2 and 5 forms triangles <0, 2, 9> and <0, 5, 9>.
3. Edge (1, 5): No additional triangles.
4. Edge (1, 6): No additional triangles.
5. Edge (2, 8): No additional triangles.
6. Edge (2, 9): Shared connection with vertex 0 forms triangle <0, 2, 9>.
7. Edge (4, 9): No additional triangles.
8. Edge (5, 1): No additional triangles.
9. Edge (5, 9): Shared connection with vertex 0 forms triangle <0, 5, 9>.
10. Edge (6, 1): No additional triangles.
11. Edge (6, 8): No additional triangles.
12. Edge (8, 0): No additional triangles.
13. Edge (8, 2): No additional triangles.
14. Edge (8, 6): No additional triangles.
15. Edge (9, 0): No additional triangles.
16. Edge (9, 2): No additional triangles.
17. Edge (9, 4): No additional triangles.
18. Edge (9, 5): No additional triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 9>.
