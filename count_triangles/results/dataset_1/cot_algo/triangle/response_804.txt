Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, we have the following labels for the vertices:  
Vertex 0 has 3 connections  
Vertex 1 has 3 connections  
Vertex 2 has 3 connections  
Vertex 3 has 2 connections  
Vertex 4 has 3 connections  
Vertex 5 has 1 connection  
Vertex 6 has 2 connections  
Vertex 7 has 4 connections  
Vertex 8 has 3 connections  
Vertex 9 has 2 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:

1. Edge (0, 1): Shared connection with vertex 4 -> Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Edge (0, 4): Shared connection with vertices 1 and 7 -> Triangles <0, 1, 4> and <0, 4, 7>
3. Edge (0, 7): Shared connection with vertex 4 -> Triangle <0, 4, 7>
4. Edge (1, 0): Already counted in step 1
5. Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed
6. Edge (1, 4): Already counted in step 1
7. Edge (2, 3): No triangles formed
8. Edge (2, 4): Shared connection with vertices 0 and 1 -> Triangle <0, 1, 4> 
9. Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed
10. Edge (3, 1): Already counted in step 5
11. Edge (3, 2): No triangles formed
12. Edge (4, 0): Already counted in step 2
13. Edge (4, 1): Already counted in step 6
14. Edge (4, 2): Already counted in step 8
15. Edge (5, 7): No triangles formed
16. Edge (6, 8): No triangles formed
17. Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed
18. Edge (7, 0): Already counted in step 3
19. Edge (7, 5): No triangles formed
20. Edge (7, 8): Shared connection with vertex 0 -> Triangle <0, 7, 8>
21. Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed
22. Edge (8, 2): Already counted in step 8
23. Edge (8, 6): No triangles formed
24. Edge (8, 7): Already counted in step 20
25. Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed
26. Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed

Total number of triangles in the graph: [3]
Triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 8>
