Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
0 - 2 connections
8 - 2 connections
2 - 2 connections
4 - 2 connections
6 - 2 connections
7 - 2 connections
5 - 3 connections
9 - 4 connections
1 - 4 connections
3 - 5 connections

Based on the ordering, we will check the edges:

(0, 1) - Check shared connections: (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 8) - <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>
(0, 8) - No triangle found
(1, 3) - Check shared connections: (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 6), (1, 3, 7), (1, 3, 8) - <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 8>
(2, 5) - No triangle found
(2, 9) - No triangle found
(3, 4) - No triangle found
(3, 6) - No triangle found
(3, 7) - No triangle found
(5, 7) - No triangle found
(9, 6) - No triangle found

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>
