Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

To count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Start with the edge (1, 4). Node 1 has fewer connections than node 4, and they share connection with node 2, forming a triangle <1, 2, 4>.

2. Move to the edge (1, 7). Node 1 has fewer connections than node 7, but they don't form a triangle.

3. Move to the edge (1, 9). Node 1 has fewer connections than node 9, and they share connection with node 3, forming a triangle <1, 3, 9>.

4. Move to the edge (4, 2). Node 2 has fewer connections than node 4, and they share connection with node 3, forming a triangle <2, 3, 4>.

5. Move to the edge (4, 3). Node 3 has fewer connections than node 4, and they share connection with nodes 0 and 5, forming triangles <0, 3, 4> and <3, 4, 5>.

6. Move to the edge (4, 1). Skip this edge since it was already considered.

7. Continue this process for all edges, counting triangles.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
