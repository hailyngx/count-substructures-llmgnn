Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degree of connections, the sorted list of vertices becomes:  
Vertices: 1 (degree 2), 3 (degree 2), 6 (degree 2), 4 (degree 3), 1 (degree 3), 8 (degree 4), 0 (degree 5), 5 (degree 5), 9 (degree 7), 7 (degree 7)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we can count the triangles as follows:

1. Looking at edge (1, 3) with lower degree vertex 1:
   - Shared connections: 5
   - Triangle: <1, 3, 5>

2. Looking at edge (1, 5) with lower degree vertex 1:
   - Shared connections: None

3. Looking at edge (3, 1) with lower degree vertex 1:
   - Shared connections: None

4. Looking at edge (4, 2) with lower degree vertex 2:
   - Shared connections: None

5. Looking at edge (5, 1) with lower degree vertex 1:
   - Shared connections: 0
   - Triangle: <1, 5, 0>

6. Looking at edge (6, 7) with lower degree vertex 6:
   - Shared connections: 9
   - Triangle: <6, 7, 9>

7. Looking at edge (6, 9) with lower degree vertex 6:
   - Shared connections: 7
   - Triangle: <6, 9, 7>

8. Looking at edge (7, 0) with lower degree vertex 0:
   - Shared connections: 8, 9
   - Triangle: <7, 0, 8>, <7, 0, 9>

9. Looking at edge (8, 0) with lower degree vertex 0:
   - Shared connections: 5
   - Triangle: <8, 0, 5>

10. Looking at edge (9, 0) with lower degree vertex 0:
   - Shared connections: 7, 8
   - Triangle: <9, 0, 7>, <9, 0, 8>

11. Looking at edge (9, 2) with lower degree vertex 2:
   - Shared connections: 0
   - Triangle: <9, 2, 0>

12. Looking at edge (9, 6) with lower degree vertex 6:
   - Shared connections: 7
   - Triangle: <9, 6, 7>

The total number of triangles is [9], and the unique triangles are <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 0>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 9, 7>, <7, 0, 8>, <7, 0, 9>, <8, 0, 5>, <9, 0, 7>, <9, 0, 8>, <9, 2, 0>, <9, 6, 7>.
