Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

The vertices in increasing order of degree are: 2, 6, 7, 0, 4, 8, 9, 5, 3, 1.

Now, we will check the edges based on the vertex ordering.

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
