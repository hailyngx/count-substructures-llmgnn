Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by degrees:

Vertices: 
1. 1 (degree 1)
2. 6 (degree 1)
3. 7 (degree 2)
4. 8 (degree 1)
5. 0 (degree 2)
6. 3 (degree 3)
7. 9 (degree 3)
8. 5 (degree 4)
9. 4 (degree 4)
10. 2 (degree 5)

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles: [6]
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 0, 4>
<2, 0, 5>
<3, 5, 4>
