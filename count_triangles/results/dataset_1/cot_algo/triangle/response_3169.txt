Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, we get the following labels for the nodes:
0-2, 1-4, 2-2, 3-2, 4-4, 5-2, 6-2, 7-5, 8-4, 9-6

Now, let's examine the edges in the order given, taking into consideration the lower labeled node in each edge.

1. Edge (0, 4): Nodes 0 and 4 have a shared connection with node 9, forming a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
2. Edge (0, 5): No triangles can be formed.
3. Edge (0, 9): Nodes 0 and 9 already form a triangle with node 4.
4. Edge (1, 2): No triangles can be formed.
5. Edge (1, 6): No triangles can be formed.
6. Edge (1, 7): Nodes 1 and 7 have a shared connection with nodes 8 and 2, forming triangles <1, 7, 2> and <1, 7, 8>.
7. Edge (1, 8): Nodes 1 and 8 have a shared connection with nodes 7 and 5, forming a triangle <1, 8, 7>.
8. Edge (2, 1): No triangles can be formed (already covered in edge 4).
9. Edge (2, 7): No triangles can be formed.
10. Edge (3, 4): Nodes 3 and 4 have a shared connection with node 9, forming a triangle <3, 4, 9>.
11. Edge (3, 7): Nodes 3 and 7 already form a triangle with node 4.
12. Edge (4, 0): Nodes 0 and 4 already form a triangle with node 9.
13. Edge (4, 3): Nodes 3 and 4 already form a triangle with node 9.
14. Edge (4, 9): Nodes 4 and 9 already form a triangle with node 0.
15. Edge (5, 0): No triangles can be formed.
16. Edge (5, 8): No triangles can be formed.
17. Edge (6, 1): No triangles can be formed.
18. Edge (6, 9): No triangles can be formed.
19. Edge (7, 1): Nodes 1 and 7 already form triangles with nodes 2 and 8.
20. Edge (7, 2): No triangles can be formed.
21. Edge (7, 3): Nodes 3 and 7 already form a triangle with node 4.
22. Edge (7, 8): No triangles can be formed.
23. Edge (7, 9): Nodes 7 and 9 have a shared connection with node 4, forming a triangle <7, 9, 4>.
24. Edge (8, 1): Nodes 1 and 8 already form a triangle with node 7.
25. Edge (8, 5): No triangles can be formed.
26. Edge (8, 7): No triangles can be formed.
27. Edge (8, 9): Nodes 8 and 9 have a shared connection with node 4, forming a triangle <8, 9, 4>.
28. Edge (9, 0): Nodes 0 and 9 already form a triangle with node 4.
29. Edge (9, 4): Nodes 4 and 9 already form a triangle with node 0.
30. Edge (9, 6): No triangles can be formed.
31. Edge (9, 7): Nodes 7 and 9 already form a triangle with node 4.
32. Edge (9, 8): Nodes 8 and 9 have a shared connection with node 4, forming a triangle <8, 9, 4>.

Count of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <7, 9, 4>
