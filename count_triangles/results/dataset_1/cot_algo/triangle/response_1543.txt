Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 4: 0 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 7, 8>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
