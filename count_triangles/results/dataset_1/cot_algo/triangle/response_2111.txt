Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has to be sorted based on the degree of each node. Here is the sorted list of nodes based on their degrees:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections

Following the degree-based ordering rule, we consider the edges in the order:
(0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (4, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 9)

Counting the triangles formed among the edges, we find the following triangles: 
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 4, 1>
<5, 4, 6>
<5, 4, 7>
<5, 4, 6>
<7, 6, 8>
<7, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
