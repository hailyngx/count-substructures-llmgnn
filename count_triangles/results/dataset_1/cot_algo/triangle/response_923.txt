Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 0: degree = 3
- Vertex 1: degree = 2
- Vertex 2: degree = 3
- Vertex 3: degree = 1
- Vertex 4: degree = 4
- Vertex 5: degree = 3
- Vertex 6: degree = 2
- Vertex 7: degree = 2
- Vertex 8: degree = 1
- Vertex 9: degree = 3

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 3 → A
- Vertex 1 → B
- Vertex 6 → C
- Vertex 8 → D
- Vertex 7 → E
- Vertex 0 → F
- Vertex 5 → G
- Vertex 9 → H
- Vertex 2 → I
- Vertex 4 → J

The edges in terms of the new labels are:
- (F, A) (F, J) (F, G)
- (B, J) (E, B)
- (C, J) (C, G) (C, H)
- (A, F)
- (J, F) (J, B) (J, C)
- (G, F) (G, C) (G, I)
- (H, C) (H, I)
- (E, B) (E, D)
- (D, E)
- (I, J) (I, H)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Process (F, A): No triangles.
- Process (F, J): No triangles.
- Process (F, G): Triangle <F, G, J>.
- Process (B, J): Triangle <B, J, C>.
- Process (E, B): No triangles.
- Process (C, J): Triangle <C, J, B>.
- Process (C, G): Triangle <C, G, F>.
- Process (C, H): No triangles.
- Process (A, F): No triangles.
- Process (J, F): No triangles.
- Process (J, B): No triangles.
- Process (J, C): No triangles.
- Process (G, F): No triangles.
- Process (G, C): Triangle <G, C, J>.
- Process (G, I): Triangle <G, I, H>.
- Process (H, C): No triangles.
- Process (E, D): No triangles.
- Process (D, E): No triangles.
- Process (I, J): Triangle <I, J, C>.
- Process (I, H): No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles:
- <F, G, J>
- <B, J, C>
- <C, G, F>
- <G, I, H>
