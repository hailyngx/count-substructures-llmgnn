Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections:
   - Vertex 2 has 1 connection.
   - Vertices 3, 4, 8, and 9 have 2 connections.
   - Vertices 1, 5, and 6 have 3 connections.
   - Vertices 0 and 7 have 5 connections.

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Vertex 2 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 0
   - Vertices 3, 4, 8, 9 (Degree 2) -> Vertices 1, 2, 3, 4
   - Vertices 1, 5, 6 (Degree 3) -> Vertices 5, 6, 7
   - Vertices 0, 7 (Degree 5) -> Vertices 8, 9

Following the degree-based ordering, we operationalize the edges:

1. Process edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 (0) has fewer connections.
2. Process edge (3, 0): Vertex 3 (1) has fewer connections.
3. Process edge (4, 0): Vertex 4 (2) has fewer connections.
4. Process edge (1, 0): Vertex 1 (3) has fewer connections.
5. Process edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 (5) has fewer connections.
6. Process edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 (3) has fewer connections.
7. Process edge (6, 0): Vertex 6 (6) has fewer connections.
8. Process edge (6, 2): Vertex 6 (6) has fewer connections.
9. Process edge (9, 1): Vertex 9 (4) has fewer connections.
10. Process edge (9, 6): Vertex 9 (4) has fewer connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] in the graph. 

The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 7>.
