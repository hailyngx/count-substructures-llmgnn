Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections

Now, let's label the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 0 (1 connection): A
Vertex 1 (2 connections): B
Vertex 3 (1 connection): C
Vertex 8 (2 connections): D
Vertex 9 (4 connections): E
Vertex 6 (4 connections): F
Vertex 7 (4 connections): G
Vertex 4 (4 connections): H
Vertex 2 (4 connections): I
Vertex 5 (4 connections): J

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze each edge to count the number of triangles:
1. (0, 9): Skipped since both have 1 connection.
2. (1, 2): Skipped since both have 2 connections.
3. (1, 5): Skipped since 2 < 4 for both.
4. (2, 1): Skipped since 2 < 4 for both.
5. (2, 7): Skipped since 2 < 4 for both.
6. (2, 9): Skipped since 2 < 4 for both.
7. (3, 6): Skipped since both have 1 connection.
8. (4, 5): Skipped since 4 < 4 for both.
9. (4, 8): Triangles found: <4, 8, 7>.
10. (4, 9): Skipped since 4 < 4 for both.
11. (5, 1): Skipped since 4 < 2 for both.
12. (5, 4): Skipped since 4 < 4 for both.
13. (5, 6): Skipped since 4 < 4 for both.
14. (5, 9): Skipped since 4 < 4 for both.
15. (6, 3): Skipped since both have 1 connection.
16. (6, 5): Skipped since 4 < 4 for both.
17. (6, 7): Skipped since 4 < 4 for both.
18. (7, 2): Skipped since 4 < 4 for both.
19. (7, 6): Skipped since 4 < 4 for both.
20. (7, 8): Skipped since 4 < 2 for both.
21. (8, 4): Triangles found: <8, 4, 7>.
22. (8, 7): Skipped since 2 < 4 for both.
23. (9, 0): Skipped since 4 < 1 for both.
24. (9, 2): Skipped since 4 < 4 for both.
25. (9, 4): Skipped since 4 < 4 for both.
26. (9, 5): Skipped since 4 < 4 for both.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <4, 8, 7> and <8, 4, 7>.
