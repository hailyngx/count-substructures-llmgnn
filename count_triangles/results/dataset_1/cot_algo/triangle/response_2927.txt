Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 8: degree 1
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 5
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 2, 3>.
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 2, 4>.
- Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <1, 0, 4>.
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <1, 4, 7>.
- Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <1, 0, 9>.

The total number of triangles is [4] which are: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 0, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 0, 9>.
