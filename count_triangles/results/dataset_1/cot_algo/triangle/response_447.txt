Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 7, 3, 4, 8, 0, 1, 9, 2, 5, 6

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- (2, 0) (0, 5) share a connection at node 0, forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
- (2, 0) (0, 9) share a connection at node 0, forming a triangle <0, 2, 9>.
- (2, 6) (6, 1) share a connection at node 6, forming a triangle <1, 2, 6>.
- (2, 6) (6, 4) share a connection at node 6, forming a triangle <2, 4, 6>.
- (2, 7) (7, 2) share a connection at node 2, forming a triangle <2, 7, 9>.
- (6, 1) (1, 9) share a connection at node 1, forming a triangle <1, 6, 9>.
- (6, 5) (5, 0) share a connection at node 5, forming a triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- (6, 5) (5, 8) share a connection at node 5, forming a triangle <5, 6, 8>.

Total number of triangles: [7]
