Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on this sorting:

Node 9 -> Node 0
Node 2 -> Node 1
Node 0 -> Node 2
Node 3 -> Node 3
Node 4 -> Node 4
Node 5 -> Node 5
Node 6 -> Node 6
Node 7 -> Node 7
Node 8 -> Node 8
Node 1 -> Node 9

Next, we will look at each edge to count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. We only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Triangle <0, 2, 1> found.
- Triangle <0, 2, 7> found.
- Triangle <0, 2, 9> found.
- Triangle <2, 5, 7> found.
- Triangle <2, 7, 6> found.
- Triangle <3, 4, 7> found.
- Triangle <3, 4, 8> found.
- Triangle <4, 6, 7> found.
- Triangle <5, 6, 7> found.

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph: [9].
