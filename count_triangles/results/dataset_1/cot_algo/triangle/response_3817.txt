Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.

By sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections, we get the following order: 7, 1, 8, 0, 3, 5, 9, 6, 2, 4.

Using the degree-based ordering method, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

- <2, 4, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
