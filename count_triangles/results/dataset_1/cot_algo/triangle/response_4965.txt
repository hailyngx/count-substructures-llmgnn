Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
Nodes sorted by degrees: 3, 1, 4, 8, 6, 9, 7, 0, 5, 2

Then we relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 3 (degree 1) -> Node 0
Node 1 (degree 2) -> Node 1
Node 4 (degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 8 (degree 3) -> Node 3
Node 6 (degree 3) -> Node 4
Node 9 (degree 3) -> Node 5
Node 7 (degree 3) -> Node 6
Node 0 (degree 4) -> Node 7
Node 5 (degree 5) -> Node 8
Node 2 (degree 5) -> Node 9

Now we will check for triangles based on the degree-based ordering method:

Triangles found: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 7, 4>
<5, 1, 8>
<5, 2, 6>
<5, 9, 8>
<7, 0, 4>
<9, 8, 5>

Total number of triangles: [8]
