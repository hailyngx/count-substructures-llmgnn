Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices by degree:
1. Node 3: 3 connections
2. Node 1: 2 connections
3. Node 7: 2 connections
4. Node 9: 2 connections
5. Node 4: 2 connections
6. Node 2: 2 connections
7. Node 5: 4 connections
8. Node 0: 5 connections
9. Node 8: 5 connections
10. Node 6: 4 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Node 3 -> A
- Node 1 -> B
- Node 7 -> C
- Node 9 -> D
- Node 4 -> E
- Node 2 -> F
- Node 5 -> G
- Node 0 -> H
- Node 8 -> I
- Node 6 -> J

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
1. Edge: (0, 4) - No mutual connections.
2. Edge: (0, 6) - Triangle formed: <0, 6, 5>.
3. Edge: (0, 7) - No mutual connections.
4. Edge: (0, 8) - No mutual connections.
5. Edge: (0, 9) - No mutual connections.
6. Edge: (1, 5) - No mutual connections.
7. Edge: (1, 9) - No mutual connections.
8. Edge: (2, 5) - No mutual connections.
9. Edge: (2, 6) - No mutual connections.
10. Edge: (2, 8) - No mutual connections.
11. Edge: (3, 7) - No mutual connections.
12. Edge: (3, 8) - No mutual connections.
13. Edge: (3, 9) - No mutual connections.
14. Edge: (4, 0) - No mutual connections.
15. Edge: (4, 7) - No mutual connections.
16. Edge: (4, 8) - No mutual connections.
17. Edge: (5, 1) - No mutual connections.
18. Edge: (5, 2) - No mutual connections.
19. Edge: (5, 6) - Triangle formed: <5, 6, 0>.
20. Edge: (5, 9) - No mutual connections.
21. Edge: (6, 0) - No mutual connections.
22. Edge: (6, 2) - No mutual connections.
23. Edge: (6, 5) - Triangle formed: <6, 5, 0>.
24. Edge: (6, 8) - Triangle formed: <6, 8, 0>.
25. Edge: (7, 0) - No mutual connections.
26. Edge: (7, 3) - No mutual connections.
27. Edge: (7, 4) - No mutual connections.
28. Edge: (8, 0) - No mutual connections.
29. Edge: (8, 2) - No mutual connections.
30. Edge: (8, 3) - No mutual connections.
31. Edge: (8, 4) - No mutual connections.
32. Edge: (8, 6) - Triangle formed: <8, 6, 0>.
33. Edge: (9, 0) - No mutual connections.
34. Edge: (9, 1) - No mutual connections.
35. Edge: (9, 3) - No mutual connections.
36. Edge: (9, 5) - No mutual connections.
