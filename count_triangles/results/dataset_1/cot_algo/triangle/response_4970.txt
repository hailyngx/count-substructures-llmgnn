Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following mapping:
- Vertex 7: Degree 1
- Vertex 3: Degree 2
- Vertex 5: Degree 2
- Vertex 8: Degree 2
- Vertex 2: Degree 3
- Vertex 4: Degree 3
- Vertex 6: Degree 4
- Vertex 1: Degree 4
- Vertex 9: Degree 6
- Vertex 0: Degree 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we count the triangles:
1. Edge (2, 4) shared connection with vertex 6 -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>
2. Edge (2, 6) shared connection with vertex 4 -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>
3. Edge (2, 9) shared connection with vertices 6, 4 -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 9>
4. Edge (3, 6) shared connection with no other edge, no triangle formed.
5. Edge (3, 8) shared connection with no other edge, no triangle formed.
6. Edge (4, 6) shared connection with no other edge, no triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] as shown above.
