Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connections, the new vertex labels are:  

Node 3: 1 connection  
Node 1: 2 connections  
Node 9: 2 connections  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 2: 5 connections  
Node 8: 5 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles formed by the edges considering the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections.  

The total number of triangles is [7].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 2, 8>  
<1, 7, 9>  
<2, 4, 6>  
<2, 7, 9>  
<4, 5, 8>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 6, 8>
