Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 8, 2>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 8, 4>
<1, 8, 7>
<1, 9, 5>
<1, 9, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 2, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
