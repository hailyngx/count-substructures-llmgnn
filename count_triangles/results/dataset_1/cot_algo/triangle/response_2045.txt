Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method can be applied as follows:

Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Nodes 1, 5, and 7 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 0 and 4 have 5 connections each.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 3 has 6 connections.
Node 9 has 6 connections.

The sorted nodes in terms of their degree are: 2, 8, 1, 5, 7, 0, 4, 6, 3, 9.

Now, analyzing the edges based on the ordering:

Edges involving nodes with lower degree:
- Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle.

Edges involving nodes with lower degree:
- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
- Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
- Edge (0, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle <0, 3, 9>.

Edges involving nodes with lower degree:
- Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle <1, 0, 3>.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle.

Edges involving nodes with lower degree:
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle <3, 0, 1>.
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.

Edges involving nodes with lower degree:
- Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.

Edges involving nodes with lower degree:
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) forms a triangle <9, 0, 3>.
- Edge (9, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.

Count of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, <3, 0, 1>
