Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections and relabeling them accordingly, we have the following edges to consider following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices: 
0 - 3 connections
1 - 4 connections
2 - 2 connections
3 - 4 connections
4 - 2 connections
5 - 1 connection
6 - 4 connections
7 - 5 connections
8 - 5 connections
9 - 5 connections

Edges to consider:
(5, 4), (2, 3), (0, 6), (1, 6), (3, 7), (4, 9), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (3, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 8), (7, 9)

Based on the shared connections between vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles:
<0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 9, 6>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
