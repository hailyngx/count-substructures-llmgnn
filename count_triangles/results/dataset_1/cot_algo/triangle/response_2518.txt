Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the relabeling is as follows: 
Node 8 has 0 connections.
Node 0 has 1 connection.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.
Node 7 has 5 connections.
Node 4 has 6 connections.
Node 5 has 7 connections.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can identify the triangles in the graph: 

Total number of triangles: [9]
