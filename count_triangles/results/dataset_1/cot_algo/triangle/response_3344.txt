Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now analyze the edges between vertices starting from the one with the lower label.

Calculating the triangles, we find the following unique triangles: 
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 2, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<6, 5, 8>
<9, 7, 2>

Encountered a total of 10 unique triangles inside <>.
The total number of triangles is [10].
