Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 1
Node 9: degree 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

For edge (0, 3): 
Node 0 and node 3 share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <0, 3, 9>.

For edge (0, 9): 
Node 0 and node 9 share connections with node 3 and node 5, forming triangles <0, 3, 5> and <0, 9, 5>.

For edge (1, 4): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (1, 6): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (2, 3): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (2, 5): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (3, 2): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (3, 0): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (4, 1): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (4, 5): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (5, 2): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (5, 4): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (5, 9): 
Node 5 and node 9 share a connection with node 0, forming a triangle <5, 9, 0>.

For edge (6, 1): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (6, 7): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (7, 6): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (9, 0): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

For edge (9, 5): 
No triangle is formed as both nodes have the same degree.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
