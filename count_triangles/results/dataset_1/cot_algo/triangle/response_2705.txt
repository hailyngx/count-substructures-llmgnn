Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. After relabeling the vertices accordingly, the new labels and connections are as follows:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections (7, 8, 5)
- Vertex 1: 1 connection (6)
- Vertex 2: 2 connections (8, 4)
- Vertex 3: 4 connections (7, 6, 4, 8)
- Vertex 4: 4 connections (9, 5, 3, 2)
- Vertex 5: 4 connections (9, 8, 4, 0)
- Vertex 6: 3 connections (7, 1, 3)
- Vertex 7: 3 connections (6, 3, 0)
- Vertex 8: 4 connections (9, 5, 3, 2)
- Vertex 9: 4 connections (8, 5, 4, 9)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges only when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <0, 4, 5>
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 6: <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <0, 3, 4>
- Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle
- Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle
- Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <3, 5, 8>
- Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle
- Edge (4, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <0, 3, 4>
- Edge (4, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <4, 5, 9>
- Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <4, 5, 9>
- Edge (5, 0) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <0, 4, 5>
- Edge (5, 4) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <4, 5, 9>
- Edge (5, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <5, 8, 9>
- Edge (6, 1) does not form a triangle
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle
- Edge (6, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (7, 0) forms a triangle with vertex 6: <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (7, 3) does not form a triangle
- Edge (7, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <3, 5, 8>
- Edge (8, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <5, 8, 9>
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 4) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <4, 5, 9>
- Edge (9, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 8: <5, 8, 9>
- Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 8, 9>.
