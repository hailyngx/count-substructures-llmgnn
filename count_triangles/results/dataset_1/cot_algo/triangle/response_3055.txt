Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes by their degree:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 1
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 1
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 1
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree:
Node 1: degree 1
Node 4: degree 1
Node 7: degree 1
Node 0: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5

Now, we will count the number of triangles.
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 6, 2>
<3, 8, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
