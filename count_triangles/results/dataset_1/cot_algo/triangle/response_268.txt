Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 1 connection
6: 5 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 6 connections
9: 3 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees (ascending order):

0 -> 0 (degree: 2)
2 -> 1 (degree: 2)
3 -> 2 (degree: 2)
5 -> 3 (degree: 1)
9 -> 4 (degree: 3)
1 -> 5 (degree: 3)
4 -> 6 (degree: 3)
7 -> 7 (degree: 4)
6 -> 8 (degree: 5)
8 -> 9 (degree: 6)

Now, we will count the triangles by checking for shared connections:

- Triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle <1, 5, 6>
- Triangle <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
