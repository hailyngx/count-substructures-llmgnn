Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 4, 9, 1, 2, 8, 5, 3, 7, 6, 0

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 → 0 connections (label: 0)
4 → 0 connections (label: 1)
9 → 0 connections (label: 2)
1 → 2 connections (label: 3)
2 → 2 connections (label: 4)
8 → 2 connections (label: 5)
5 → 2 connections (label: 6)
3 → 3 connections (label: 7)
7 → 3 connections (label: 8)
6 → 4 connections (label: 9)

Now, we will analyze the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 1) forms triangles with 3, 5, and 6. (Triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>)
(0, 3) forms a triangle with 6. (Triangle: <0, 3, 6>)
(0, 5) does not form a triangle.
(0, 6) does not form a triangle.
(0, 7) does not form a triangle.
(1, 2) does not form a triangle.
(1, 3) forms a triangle with 6. (Triangle: <1, 3, 6>)
(1, 5) does not form a triangle.
(2, 7) does not form a triangle.
(2, 9) does not form a triangle.
(3, 6) does not form a triangle.
(6, 8) does not form a triangle.
(7, 8) does not form a triangle.

Counting the triangles: [5]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 5.
