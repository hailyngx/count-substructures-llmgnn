Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the degree of each node in the graph:
Node 0 has a degree of 4
Node 2 has a degree of 4
Node 3 has a degree of 2
Node 4 has a degree of 2
Node 5 has a degree of 2
Node 6 has a degree of 1
Node 7 has a degree of 4
Node 8 has a degree of 1
Node 9 has a degree of 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 6 (degree 1) will be relabeled as 0
Node 8 (degree 1) will be relabeled as 1
Node 3 (degree 2) will be relabeled as 2
Node 4 (degree 2) will be relabeled as 3
Node 5 (degree 2) will be relabeled as 4
Node 0 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 5
Node 2 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 6
Node 7 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 7
Node 9 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 8

Now, let's find the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
