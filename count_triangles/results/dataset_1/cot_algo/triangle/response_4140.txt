Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:  

- Node 5: 0 connections  
- Node 2: 1 connection  
- Node 8: 1 connection  
- Node 3: 2 connections  
- Node 4: 3 connections  
- Node 7: 4 connections  
- Node 1: 5 connections  
- Node 6: 5 connections  
- Node 0: 6 connections  
- Node 9: 6 connections
