Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps efficiently find the total number of triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges.

Let's first sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 0(3), 1(3), 2(3), 3(3), 4(3), 7(2), 8(2), 9(2), 6(1)

Now, we start counting triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): 
    - Shared connections with 0: 3, 7
    - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>

2. Edge (0, 3):
    - Shared connection with 0: 1
    - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>

3. Edge (0, 7):
    - No new triangles found.

4. Edge (1, 0):
    - No new triangles found.

5. Edge (1, 6):
    - No new triangles found.

6. Edge (1, 7):
    - Shared connection with 1: 0
    - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 7>

7. Edge (2, 4):
    - No new triangles found.

8. Edge (2, 8):
    - No new triangles found.

9. Edge (2, 9):
    - No new triangles found.

10. Edge (3, 4):
    - Shared connection with 3: 0
    - Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>

11. Edge (3, 9):
    - No new triangles found.

12. Edge (4, 2):
    - No new triangles found.

13. Edge (4, 3):
    - No new triangles found.

14. Edge (4, 8):
    - No new triangles found.

15. Edge (6, 1):
    - No new triangles found.

16. Edge (7, 0):
    - No new triangles found.

17. Edge (7, 1):
    - No new triangles found.

18. Edge (8, 2):
    - No new triangles found.

19. Edge (8, 4):
    - No new triangles found.

20. Edge (9, 2):
    - No new triangles found.

21. Edge (9, 3):
    - No new triangles found.

After exploring all edges with the Degree-Based Ordering method, we found the following triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
