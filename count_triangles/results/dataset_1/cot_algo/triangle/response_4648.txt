Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 1
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 2
- Node 9: Degree 1

Now, we can relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 5: 0
- Node 9: 1
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 3
- Node 8: 4
- Node 2: 5
- Node 4: 6
- Node 6: 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 7: 9

Next, we will list the edges in their new labels: (2, 4) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 9) (5, 6) (6, 7) (7, 9) (8, 4) (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 8) (4, 9)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Number of triangles: 1
Unique triangles: <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1].
