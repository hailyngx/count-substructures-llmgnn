Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are: 
Node 1 has 0 connections.
Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Then, we count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found.

Triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
