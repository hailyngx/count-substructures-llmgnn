Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:  
Vertex 0 has 3 connections  
Vertex 1 has 1 connection  
Vertex 2 has 1 connection  
Vertex 3 has 2 connections  
Vertex 4 has 4 connections  
Vertex 5 has 3 connections  
Vertex 6 has 3 connections  
Vertex 7 has 1 connection  
Vertex 8 has 2 connections  
Vertex 9 has 1 connection  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 3), and (6, 9).

We find that there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 8>, and <4, 5, 6>.
