Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices: 2, 5, 6, 2, 1, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5
Degrees: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5

Now, considering edges where the vertex with a lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 4) - forms a triangle with 7
(0, 6) - no additional triangles
(0, 7) - forms a triangle with 1 and 4
(0, 9) - no additional triangles
(1, 3) - no additional triangles
(1, 7) - no additional triangles
(1, 8) - no additional triangles
(1, 9) - forms a triangle with 4
(2, 8) - no additional triangles
(3, 1) - no additional triangles
(3, 9) - no additional triangles
(4, 0) - already counted
(4, 5) - forms a triangle with 9
(4, 7) - already counted
(5, 4) - already counted
(5, 9) - already counted
(6, 0) - already counted
(6, 8) - no additional triangles
(7, 0) - already counted
(7, 1) - already counted
(7, 4) - already counted
(7, 8) - no additional triangles
(8, 1) - already counted
(8, 2) - no additional triangles
(8, 6) - no additional triangles
(8, 7) - already counted
(9, 0) - already counted
(9, 1) - already counted
(9, 3) - no additional triangles
(9, 5) - already counted

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>, <4, 5, 9>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <7, 8, 4>
