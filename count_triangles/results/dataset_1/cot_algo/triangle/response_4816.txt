Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 7 has 0 connection(s).  
Node 0 has 1 connection(s).  
Node 2 has 2 connection(s).  
Node 8 has 2 connection(s).  
Node 1 has 4 connection(s).  
Node 5 has 4 connection(s).  
Node 3 has 5 connection(s).  
Node 9 has 5 connection(s).  
Node 4 has 8 connection(s).  
Node 6 has 8 connection(s).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:  
<1, 8, 5>  
<1, 5, 8>  
<1, 5, 9>  
<0, 6, 2>  
<0, 6, 4>  
<2, 6, 4>  
<5, 6, 9>  
<3, 1, 4>  
<3, 1, 5>  
<3, 1, 8>  
<3, 4, 5>  
<3, 4, 8>  
<3, 4, 9>  
<4, 5, 8>  
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
