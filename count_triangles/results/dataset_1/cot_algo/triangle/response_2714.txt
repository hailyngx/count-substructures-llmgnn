Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:   
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 4: 2 connections  
Node 5: 1 connection  
Node 6: 5 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 9: 4 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

By examining these edges, we can count the triangles in the graph:  
(1, 0) shares a connection with 0 and 2, forming a triangle <1, 0, 2>.  
(3, 4) shares a connection with 4 and 6, forming a triangle <3, 4, 6>.  
(3, 8) shares a connection with 8 and 2, forming a triangle <3, 8, 2>.  
(5, 9) shares a connection with 9 and 6, forming a triangle <5, 9, 6>.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
