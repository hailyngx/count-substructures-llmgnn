Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections, from least to most. Then, we assign new labels to the vertices according to this ordering.

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their degrees:
Node 6: 0 edges
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 2: 3 edges
Node 0: 4 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 4: 5 edges
Node 7: 6 edges
Node 3: 6 edges
Node 8: 7 edges

With the new labels, the edges to consider are:
(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 9), (7, 8), (8, 9)

Analyzing these edges to count the triangles:

Triangles:
1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <1, 3, 7>
3. <1, 3, 9>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <5, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
