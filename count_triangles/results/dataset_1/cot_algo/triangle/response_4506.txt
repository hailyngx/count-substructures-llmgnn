Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 6 with 2 connections (0, 1)
- Node 9 with 1 connection (8)
- Nodes 2, 4 with 1 connection (4)
- Nodes 7 with 2 connections (1, 8)
- Nodes 3, 5 with 2 connections (0, 8)
- Nodes 0, 1, 11 with 3 connections (6, 3, 7)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:
1. (0, 1) - Node 0 (3 connections) has more connections than Node 1 (3 connections).
2. (0, 3) - Node 0 (3 connections) has more connections than Node 3 (2 connections).
3. (0, 6) - Node 0 (3 connections) has more connections than Node 6 (2 connections).
4. (1, 6) - Node 1 (3 connections) has more connections than Node 6 (2 connections).
5. (1, 7) - Node 1 (3 connections) has more connections than Node 7 (2 connections).
6. (2, 4) - Node 2 (1 connection) has fewer connections than Node 4 (1 connection), so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Node 2 and Node 4: None
7. (3, 5) - Node 3 (2 connections) has more connections than Node 5 (2 connections).
8. (5, 8) - Node 5 (2 connections) has more connections than Node 8 (3 connections), so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Node 5 and Node 8: None
9. (6, 0) - Node 6 (2 connections) has fewer connections than Node 0 (3 connections), so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Node 6 and Node 0: None
10. (6, 1) - Node 6 (2 connections) has fewer connections than Node 1 (3 connections), so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Node 6 and Node 1: None
11. (7, 1) - Node 7 (2 connections) has fewer connections than Node 1 (3 connections), so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Node 7 and Node 1: None
12. (7, 8) - Node 7 (2 connections) has fewer connections than Node 8 (3 connections), so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Node 7 and Node 8: None
13. (8, 7) - Node 8 (3 connections) has more connections than Node 7 (2 connections), so we don't proceed.
14. (8, 9) - Node 8 (3 connections) has more connections than Node 9 (1 connection), so we don't proceed.

Therefore, there are a total of 0 triangles in this graph.
