Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 4: 0 connections
Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 6 connections
Vertex 8: 6 connections

Now, we will process the edges in the order of the vertices:

Edges involving Vertex 0 (3 connections):
- (0, 1): Shared connection with Vertex 1 (1, 3)
- (0, 6): Shared connection with Vertex 6 (6, 2)
- (0, 8): Shared connection with Vertex 8 (8, 1)

Edges involving Vertex 1 (3 connections):
- (1, 0): Shared connection with Vertex 0 (0, 3)
- (1, 6): Shared connection with Vertex 6 (6, 2)
- (1, 8): Shared connection with Vertex 8 (8, 0)

Edges involving Vertex 7 (3 connections):
- (7, 2): Shared connection with Vertex 2 (2, 9)
- (7, 3): Shared connection with Vertex 3 (3, 6)
- (7, 9): Shared connection with Vertex 9 (9, 2)

Edges involving Vertex 3 (4 connections):
- (3, 6): Shared connection with Vertex 6 (6, 0)
- (3, 7): Shared connection with Vertex 7 (7, 2)
- (3, 9): Shared connection with Vertex 9 (9, 7)

Edges involving Vertex 9 (4 connections):
- (9, 2): Shared connection with Vertex 2 (2, 7)
- (9, 3): Shared connection with Vertex 3 (3, 7)
- (9, 5): Does not meet the condition

The triangles formed are:
<0, 1, 6> (Shared connection: 1)
<0, 6, 8> (Shared connection: 6)
<1, 6, 2> (Shared connection: 6)

The total number of triangles is [3].
