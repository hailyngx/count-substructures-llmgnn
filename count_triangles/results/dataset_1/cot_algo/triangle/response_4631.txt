Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. The vertices are labeled from 0 to 9 as follows:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 4: 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the graph can be found by examining the edges with the lower labeled vertex first.

Triangles can be formed by the following unique combinations of vertices:
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
