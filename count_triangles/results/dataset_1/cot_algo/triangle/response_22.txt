Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each vertex based on the given edges:  

- Node 0: Degree 1
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 6
- Node 8: Degree 1
- Node 9: Degree 1

Next, we need to reorder the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 0: Degree 1
- Node 8: Degree 1
- Node 9: Degree 1
- Node 3: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 7: Degree 6

Now, we'll go through the edges and count the triangles:

Triangles:
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
