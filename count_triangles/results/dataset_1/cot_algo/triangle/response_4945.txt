Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Nodes: 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 9 -> 0 -> 6 -> 7

Now, counting the triangles: 

Number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 5>, <7, 6, 5>, <4, 6, 9>
