Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 0 connections.
Node 8 has 1 connection.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 1 connection.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Checking the edge (0, 3):
Both nodes have fewer connections than each other. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (0, 9):
Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 9. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (1, 2):
Both nodes have fewer connections than each other. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (1, 6):
Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 6. Triangle <1, 6, 7> formed.

Checking the edge (1, 7):
Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 7. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (2, 9):
Both nodes have fewer connections than each other. Triangle <2, 9, 6> formed.

Checking the edge (3, 0):
Both nodes have fewer connections than each other. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (4, 6):
Node 4 has fewer connections than Node 6. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (4, 7):
Node 4 has fewer connections than Node 7. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (5, 6):
Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 6. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (6, 1):
Both nodes have fewer connections than each other. Triangle <1, 6, 7> already counted.

Checking the edge (6, 4):
Node 4 has fewer connections than Node 6. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (6, 5):
Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 6. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (6, 7):
Node 6 has more connections than Node 7. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (6, 9):
Node 6 has more connections than Node 9. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (7, 1):
Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 7. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (7, 4):
Node 4 has fewer connections than Node 7. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (7, 6):
Node 6 has more connections than Node 7. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (7, 8):
Node 7 has more connections than Node 8. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (8, 7):
Node 7 has more connections than Node 8. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (9, 0):
Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 9. No triangle formed.

Checking the edge (9, 2):
Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 9. Triangle <2, 9, 6> already counted.

Checking the edge (9, 6):
Node 6 has more connections than Node 9. No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <1, 6, 7>, <2, 9, 6>
