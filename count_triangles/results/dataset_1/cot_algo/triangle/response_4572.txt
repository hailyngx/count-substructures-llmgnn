Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 0
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Using this method, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<7, 1, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
