Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
By arranging the vertices based on their degree, we have the following order: 
Node 4 has degree 2.
Nodes 5 and 6 have degree 3.
Nodes 1 and 3 have degree 4.
Nodes 0, 7, and 9 have degree 5.
Node 2 has degree 6.

We will now count the triangles by processing edges starting from the nodes with the least connections. 

Proceeding with the edges: <br>
(4, 1) - No triangles
(5, 2) - No triangles
(6, 2) - No triangles
(1, 4) - No triangles

(0, 3) - Triangle <0, 3, 7>
(0, 7) - No triangles
(0, 9) - No triangles
(1, 7) - Triangle <1, 4, 7>
(1, 9) - No triangles
(2, 7) - Triangle <2, 6, 7>
(2, 9) - Triangle <2, 6, 9>
(3, 0) - Triangle <0, 3, 9>
(3, 9) - Triangle <3, 6, 9>
(4, 7) - No triangles
(7, 0) - Triangle <0, 3, 7>
(7, 1) - Triangle <1, 4, 7>
(7, 2) - Triangle <2, 6, 7>
(7, 4) - No triangles
(9, 0) - No triangles
(9, 1) - No triangles
(9, 2) - Triangle <2, 6, 9>
(9, 3) - Triangle <3, 6, 9>
(9, 6) - No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, and <3, 6, 9>.
