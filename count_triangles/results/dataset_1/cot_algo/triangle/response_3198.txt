Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4

Sorting the nodes by degree from least to most, we get: 1, 5, 7, 0, 4, 6, 2, 3, 8.

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (1, 4): Nodes 1 and 4 do not share any neighbors.
- Edge (5, 3): Nodes 5 and 3 do not share any neighbors.
- Edge (7, 0): Nodes 7 and 0 do not share any neighbors.
- Edge (0, 2): Nodes 0 and 2 share a neighbor (6).
    Triangle: <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (4, 1): Nodes 4 and 1 do not share any neighbors.
- Edge (6, 5): Nodes 6 and 5 do not share any neighbors.
- Edge (2, 0): Nodes 2 and 0 share two neighbors (6, 7).
    Triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>
- Edge (7, 3): Nodes 7 and 3 do not share any neighbors.
- Edge (0, 6): Nodes 0 and 6 share two neighbors (2, 7).
    Triangle: <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (8, 4): Nodes 8 and 4 do not share any neighbors.
- Edge (3, 7): Nodes 3 and 7 do not share any neighbors.
- Edge (3, 5): Nodes 3 and 5 do not share any neighbors.
- Edge (2, 4): Nodes 2 and 4 share a neighbor (8).
    Triangle: <2, 4, 8>
- Edge (6, 0): Nodes 6 and 0 share two neighbors (2, 7).
    Triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>
- Edge (2, 6): Nodes 2 and 6 share two neighbors (0, 5).
    Triangle: <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (6, 5): Nodes 6 and 5 do not share any neighbors.
- Edge (6, 8): Nodes 6 and 8 share a neighbor (4).
    Triangle: <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (3, 2): Nodes 3 and 2 share two neighbors (0, 4).
    Triangle: <0, 2, 4>, <2, 3, 4>
- Edge (8, 6): Nodes 8 and 6 share a neighbor (4).
    Triangle: <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (3, 8): Nodes 3 and 8 share two neighbors (4, 6).
    Triangle: <4, 6, 8>
