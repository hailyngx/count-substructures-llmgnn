Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices:  
0 (degree 3)  
1 (degree 4)  
5 (degree 3)  
7 (degree 3)  
2 (degree 2)  
4 (degree 3)  
8 (degree 4)  
3 (degree 3)  
9 (degree 3)  
6 (degree 6)  


Based on the sorted list, we will now analyze each edge starting from the one with the vertex of lower label and fewer connections:

Analyzing edge (0, 2):
Vertex 0 and 2 have a shared connection with vertex 4 forming a triangle: <0, 2, 4>

Analyzing edge (0, 4):
Vertex 0 and 4 have a shared connection with vertex 6 forming a triangle: <0, 4, 6>
