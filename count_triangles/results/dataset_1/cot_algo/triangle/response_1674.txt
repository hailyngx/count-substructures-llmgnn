Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Reorder the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices: 
0 - 2 connections
3 - 1 connection
4 - 1 connection
8 - 2 connections
9 - 2 connections
1 - 6 connections
7 - 4 connections
5 - 4 connections
6 - 4 connections
2 - 5 connections
