Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help identify the number of triangles in the given graph. Let's begin by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
Node 3: 1 connection
Nodes 7, 2: 2 connections
Nodes 5, 6: 3 connections
Nodes 0, 1, 9: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles they form based on the rules provided. Let's list the triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<8, 9, 4>
