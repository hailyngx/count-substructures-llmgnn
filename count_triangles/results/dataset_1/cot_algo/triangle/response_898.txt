Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Vertex 4 : 1 connection
Vertex 6 : 1 connection
Vertex 7 : 1 connection
Vertex 9 : 1 connection
Vertex 0 : 3 connections
Vertex 5 : 3 connections
Vertex 3 : 4 connections
Vertex 2 : 4 connections
Vertex 1 : 5 connections
Vertex 8 : 5 connections

Since the graph has 24 edges, we will go through each edge in the order of vertices with the lower label having fewer connections:
1. Edge (4, 8): Both vertices have 1 connection, no triangles.
2. Edge (6, 2): Both vertices have 1 connection, no triangles.
3. Edge (7, 8): Vertex 7 has 1 connection, no triangle.
4. Edge (9, 1): Vertex 9 has 1 connection, no triangles.
5. Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 has 3 connections, which are {2, 3, 1}. Vertex 1 has 5 connections, which are {0, 2, 3, 9, 1}. These two vertices share connections {2, 3}, forming a triangle: <0, 1, 2>.
6. Edge (0, 2): Vertex 0 has 3 connections, which are {1, 2, 3}. Vertex 2 has 4 connections, which are {0, 1, 3, 6}. These two vertices share connections {1, 3}, forming a triangle: <0, 2, 1>.
7. Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 has 3 connections, which are {1, 2, 3}. Vertex 3 has 4 connections, which are {0, 1, 2, 5}. These two vertices share connections {1, 2}, forming a triangle: <0, 3, 1>.
8. Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has 5 connections, which are {0, 2, 3, 9, 1}. Vertex 2 has 4 connections, which are {0, 1, 3, 6}. These two vertices share connections {0, 3}, forming a triangle: <1, 2, 0>.
9. Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 has 5 connections, which are {0, 2, 3, 9, 1}. Vertex 3 has 4 connections, which are {0, 1, 2, 5}. These two vertices share connections {0, 2}, forming a triangle: <1, 3, 0>.
10. Edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 has 5 connections, which are {0, 2, 3, 9, 1}. Vertex 9 has 1 connection, no triangles.
11. Edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 has 4 connections, which are {0, 1, 3, 6}. Vertex 3 has 4 connections, which are {0, 1, 2, 5}. These two vertices share connections {0, 1}, forming a triangle: <2, 3, 0>.
12. Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 has 4 connections, which are {0, 1, 3, 6}. Vertex 6 has 1 connection, no triangles.
13. Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 has 4 connections, which are {0, 1, 2, 5}. Vertex 5 has 3 connections, which are {3, 8, 5}. These two vertices share connection 3, forming a triangle: <3, 5, 8>.
14. Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5 has 3 connections, which are {3, 8, 5}. Vertex 8 has 5 connections, which are {4, 8, 5, 7, 8}. These two vertices share connection 8, forming a triangle: <5, 8, 4>.
15. Edge (8, 7): Vertex 8 has 5 connections, which are {4, 8, 5, 7, 8}. Vertex 7 has 1 connection, no triangles.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 3, 1>, <1, 2, 0>, <3, 5, 8>
