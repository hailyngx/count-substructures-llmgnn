Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 8: 0 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will now count the triangles:

1. (1, 2, 4)
2. (1, 5, 9)
3. (2, 6, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
