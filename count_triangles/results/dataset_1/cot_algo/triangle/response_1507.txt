Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 5 has 4 connections.
- Node 1 has 2 connections.
- Node 3 has 2 connections.
- Node 7 has 2 connections.
- Node 4 has 3 connections.
- Node 6 has 4 connections.
- Node 8 has 5 connections.
- Node 2 has 3 connections.
- Node 9 has 8 connections.
- Node 0 has 3 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider edges only when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex.

Using this approach, we find that there are 25 triangles in the given graph.

Total number of triangles: [25]
