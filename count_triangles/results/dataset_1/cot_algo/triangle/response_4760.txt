Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Node 1 (degree 0): 1  
Node 0 (degree 2): 2  
Node 4 (degree 2): 3  
Node 7 (degree 2): 4  
Node 5 (degree 3): 5  
Node 3 (degree 3): 6  
Node 6 (degree 4): 7  
Node 8 (degree 5): 8  
Node 9 (degree 5): 9  
Node 2 (degree 6): 10  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we find the following triangles: 
[Total number of triangles: 8] 
<0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 6>, <5, 8, 2>, <5, 8, 6>, <5, 2, 6>, <8, 7, 9>, <8, 2, 9>
