Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 9, 7, 8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 1, 0, 2.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find that there are 6 triangles in the graph. The triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
