Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the labels for the vertices will be as follows:  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 1: 2 connections  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 5: 5 connections  
Node 8: 5 connections  
Node 2: 5 connections  
Node 9: 5 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check the edges based on the labels of the vertices. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 2, 6>  
<0, 2, 8>  
<0, 4, 8>  
<0, 6, 8>  
<1, 5, 7>  
<2, 5, 7>  
<2, 5, 9>  
<2, 7, 9>  
<5, 6, 8>  
<5, 8, 9>  
<6, 8, 9>  
<7, 8, 9>
