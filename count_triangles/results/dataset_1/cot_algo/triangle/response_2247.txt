Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0 (degree 3)
- Vertex 1 (degree 3)
- Vertex 3 (degree 1)
- Vertex 4 (degree 1)
- Vertex 6 (degree 1)
- Vertex 5 (degree 2)
- Vertex 7 (degree 4)
- Vertex 9 (degree 4)
- Vertex 2 (degree 6)
- Vertex 8 (degree 9)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Checking edge (0, 2): Shared connections with vertex 5, forming triangle <0, 2, 5>.
- Checking edge (0, 5): No new triangles.
- Checking edge (0, 8): Shared connections with vertices 1 and 2, forming triangles <0, 1, 8> and <0, 2, 8>.
- Checking remaining edges, but no new triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, and <0, 2, 8>.
