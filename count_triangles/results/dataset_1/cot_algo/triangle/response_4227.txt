Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After rearranging the vertices based on their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Node 0 --> degree 4
Node 1 --> degree 3
Node 2 --> degree 1
Node 3 --> degree 4
Node 4 --> degree 5
Node 5 --> degree 2
Node 6 --> degree 2
Node 8 --> degree 2
Node 9 --> degree 2

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine each edge to count the number of triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <0, 5, 3>
4. <0, 5, 4>
5. <0, 8, 3>
6. <0, 8, 4>
7. <1, 4, 2>
8. <3, 4, 6>
9. <3, 4, 8>
10. <3, 5, 6>
11. <3, 5, 8>
12. <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
