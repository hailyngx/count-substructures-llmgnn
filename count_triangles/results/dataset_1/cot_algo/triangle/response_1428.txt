Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for each vertex are:
- Node 0 with degree 3
- Node 1 with degree 3
- Node 5 with degree 3
- Node 9 with degree 3
- Node 2 with degree 2
- Node 8 with degree 4
- Node 3 with degree 3
- Node 4 with degree 2
- Node 7 with degree 1
- Node 6 with degree 1

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles as follows:

- Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 9, 3>
- Triangle <2, 8, 4>
- Triangle <5, 7, 1>
- Triangle <8, 6, 3>
- Triangle <9, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
