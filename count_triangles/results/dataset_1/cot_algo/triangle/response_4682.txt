Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves the following steps:

1. Sort vertices by the number of connections (degree) from least to most.
    - Vertices in ascending order based on degree: 9, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 5, 8, 6, 3.

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
    - Original Label: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
    - New Label:     5  3  4  2  8  1  9  7  6

3. Count triangles by examining each edge:
    - (2, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <2, 3, 1>.
    - (2, 7) does not form a triangle as vertex 2's degree is higher.
    - (4, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <4, 6, 1>.
    - (5, 8) does not form a triangle as vertex 5's degree is higher.
    - (3, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <3, 6, 1>.
    - (3, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <3, 8, 1>.
    - (3, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <3, 9, 1>.

4. Calculate the total number of triangles and list unique triangles:
    - Total number of triangles []: [4]
    - Unique triangles found <>: <2, 3, 1>, <4, 6, 1>, <3, 8, 1>, <3, 9, 1>.
