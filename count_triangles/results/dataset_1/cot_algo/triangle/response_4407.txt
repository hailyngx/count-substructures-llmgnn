Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the vertices are relabeled as follows: 

Vertex 0 has 2 connections.
Vertex 4 has 0 connections.
Vertex 7 has 2 connections.
Vertex 8 has 2 connections.
Vertex 3 has 3 connections.
Vertex 5 has 3 connections.
Vertex 1 has 5 connections.
Vertex 9 has 5 connections.
Vertex 2 has 5 connections.
Vertex 6 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles. 

Triangles:
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
