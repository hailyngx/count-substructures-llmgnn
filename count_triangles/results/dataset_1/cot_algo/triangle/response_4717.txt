Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices by their number of connections as follows:
Vertices sorted by degree: [3, 4, 6, 2, 7, 1, 5, 9, 8, 0]

Now, we will check each edge based on the condition mentioned.

Triangles found: <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
