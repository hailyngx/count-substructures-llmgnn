Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections). The sorted order of the vertices is as follows:
Node 3 < Node 9 < Node 6 < Node 2 < Node 5 < Node 7 < Node 1 < Node 4 < Node 8 < Node 0

Analyzing the edges based on the sorted order, we find the following triangles:
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<4, 8, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
