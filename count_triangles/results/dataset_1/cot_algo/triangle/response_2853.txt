Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   Node 6 has 0 connections.
   Nodes 0, 3 have 2 connections.
   Nodes 7, 9 have 3 connections.
   Nodes 4, 8 have 4 connections.
   Nodes 1, 5 have 5 connections.
   Node 2 has 4 connections.

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   Relabel Node 6 as 0.
   Relabel Nodes 0, 3 as 1.
   Relabel Nodes 7, 9 as 2.
   Relabel Nodes 4, 8 as 3.
   Relabel Nodes 1, 5 as 4.
   Relabel Node 2 as 5.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check each edge to count the number of triangles:

- For edge (0, 1), proceed since 0 < 1 and both have 2 connections. Check for shared connections: (0, 1) share Node 5, so there is a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- For edge (0, 5), proceed since 0 < 5 and 0 has 2 connections while 5 has 5 connections. Check for shared connections: (0, 5) share Node 1, so there is a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- For other edges, no triangles are formed.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2] as found above.
