Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:  
Vertices: 4, 5, 1, 8, 6, 7, 3, 9, 0, 2

After relabeling the vertices, the new edge list based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections is as follows:
(0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (9, 7)

Now, we check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find triangles:

1. Shared connections with edge (0, 2): <0, 2, 3>
2. Shared connections with edge (0, 3): <0, 3, 2>
3. Shared connections with edge (0, 6): <0, 6, 1>
4. Shared connections with edge (0, 9): <0, 9, 7>
5. Shared connections with edge (1, 6): <1, 6, 0>
6. Shared connections with edge (1, 7): <1, 7, 9>
7. Shared connections with edge (2, 3): <2, 3, 0>
8. Shared connections with edge (2, 8): <2, 8, 6>
9. Shared connections with edge (2, 9): <2, 9, 0>
10. Shared connections with edge (3, 2): <3, 2, 0>
11. Shared connections with edge (6, 8): <6, 8, 2>
12. Shared connections with edge (6, 1): <6, 1, 0>
13. Shared connections with edge (6, 7): <6, 7, 1>
14. Shared connections with edge (7, 5): <7, 5, 1>
15. Shared connections with edge (9, 7): <9, 7, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [15].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 9, 7>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 0>, <2, 8, 6>, <2, 9, 0>, <3, 2, 0>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 1, 0>, <6, 7, 1>, <7, 5, 1>, <9, 7, 1>.
