Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each node has:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their number of connections:
- Node 3: 1
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 4
- Node 9: 5
- Node 0: 6
- Node 2: 7
- Node 4: 8
- Node 1: 9

Now, we will check the edges based on the relabeled nodes.
- Edge (3, 4) is not considered because both nodes have less connections than the other.
- Edge (3, 5) forms a triangle with Node 9: <3, 5, 9>.
- Edge (5, 9) forms a triangle with Node 3: <5, 9, 3>.
- Edge (6, 7) is not considered because both nodes have less connections than the other.
- Edge (0, 1) is not considered because both nodes have less connections than the other.
- Edge (0, 2) is not considered because both nodes have less connections than the other.
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with Node 6: <0, 7, 6>.
- Edge (1, 0) is not considered because Node 1 has more connections than Node 0.
- Edge (1, 2) is not considered because both nodes have less connections than the other.
- Edge (1, 4) is not considered because Node 1 has more connections than Node 4.
- Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle with Node 7: <1, 6, 7>.
- Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with Node 2: <1, 9, 2>.
- Edge (2, 0) is not considered because both nodes have less connections than the other.
- Edge (2, 1) is not considered because Node 2 has more connections than Node 1.
- Edge (2, 4) is not considered because Node 2 has more connections than Node 4.
- Edge (2, 9) forms a triangle with Node 1: <2, 9, 1>.
- Edge (4, 1) is not considering because Node 1 has less connections than Node 4.
- Edge (4, 2) is not considered because Node 4 has more connections than Node 2.
- Edge (4, 3) is not considered because Node 4 has more connections than Node 3.
- Edge (9, 1) is not considered because Node 9 has more connections than Node 1.
- Edge (9, 2) is not considered because Node 2 has more connections than Node 9.
- Edge (9, 5) forms a triangle with Node 3: <9, 5, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles found is [3] inside brackets.
