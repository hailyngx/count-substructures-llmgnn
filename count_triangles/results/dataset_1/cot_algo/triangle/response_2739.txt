Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
(3) -> 0
(2) -> 1
(3) -> 2
(3) -> 3
(5) -> 4
(1) -> 5
(5) -> 6
(3) -> 7
(5) -> 8
(3) -> 9

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge:

For edge (0, 1):
Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 4, 6, and 9.
Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 3 and 5.
Thus, there is a triangle <0, 1, 5>.

For edge (0, 4):
Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 6, and 9.
Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8.
Thus, there are two triangles: <0, 4, 1> and <0, 4, 6>.

For the remaining edges, there are no additional triangles that have not already been counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 1>, and <0, 4, 6>.
