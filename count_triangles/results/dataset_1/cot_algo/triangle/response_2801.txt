Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:

Vertices: 0(2), 1(2), 2(3), 3(3), 4(2), 5(2), 6(2), 7(2), 8(4), 9(2)

We will then relabel the vertices according to their degrees:

0(2) -> 0(0), 1(2) -> 1(1), 2(3) -> 2(5), 3(3) -> 3(6), 4(2) -> 4(2), 5(2) -> 5(3), 6(2) -> 6(4), 7(2) -> 7(7), 8(4) -> 8(8), 9(2) -> 9(9)

Now, let's examine the edges. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles:
<0, 5, 3>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
