Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0 has degree 2, Node 1 has degree 2, Node 3 has degree 1, Node 5 has degree 1, Node 8 has degree 2.
Relabeling the nodes:
Node 3 (degree 1) -> Node 0
Node 5 (degree 1) -> Node 1
Node 0 (degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 1 (degree 2) -> Node 3
Node 8 (degree 2) -> Node 4

After relabeling, the edges are as follows:
(2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8)

Following the logic of checking shared connections between the lower labeled vertex on each edge:
Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 4, 7>

Total number of triangles: [2]
