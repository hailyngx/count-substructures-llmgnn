Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's write down the number of connections each node has:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Now, we need to sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes: 7, 9, 1, 8, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3

Next, we will go through each edge in the sorted order and count the triangles:
(3, 1) - Node 3 has connections with 1 and 6. Node 1 has connections with 3 and 6. They share connection 6. So, there is a triangle <1, 3, 6>.
(7, 2) - Node 7 doesn't share connections with node 2. No triangle.
(9, 3) - Node 9 doesn't share connections with node 3. No triangle.
(8, 5) - Node 8 has connections with 4 and 5. Node 5 has connections with 2, 4, and 6. They share connection 4. So, there is a triangle <4, 5, 8>.

Now, we count the total number of triangles:
[2]

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
