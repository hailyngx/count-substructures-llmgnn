Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
0: 4 edges
1: 5 edges
3: 3 edges
7: 1 edge
9: 2 edges
4: 3 edges
8: 4 edges
6: 4 edges
2: 4 edges
5: 3 edges

Now, we will start counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 3>
<4, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [10]
