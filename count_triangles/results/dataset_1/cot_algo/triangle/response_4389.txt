Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
Node 5 (Degree 1)
Node 2 (Degree 1)
Node 0 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 3)
Node 9 (Degree 4)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 4)
Node 7 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 5)
Node 4 (Degree 5)

Triangles found using the method:
