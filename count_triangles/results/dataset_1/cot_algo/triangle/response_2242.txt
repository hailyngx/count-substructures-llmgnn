Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph.

[The total number of triangles is: 6]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
