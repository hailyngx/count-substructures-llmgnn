Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Degrees: 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices: 9, 1, 3, 7, 6, 8, 2, 5
Degrees: 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4

Next, we will count the triangles by considering each edge. Since the vertex with the lower label should have fewer connections, we will only consider edges where this condition is met:

Triangles: 
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 5>
<2, 6, 7>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 6, 2>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 2>
<5, 7, 3>
<5, 7, 6>
<6, 2, 5>
<6, 5, 2>
<6, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 2>
<6, 7, 5>
<7, 2, 5>
<7, 2, 6>
<7, 3, 5>
<7, 5, 2>
<7, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [20]
