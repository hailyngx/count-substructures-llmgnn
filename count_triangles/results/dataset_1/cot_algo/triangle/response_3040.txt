Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes will be:
Node 5 - 2 connections
Node 1 - 2 connections
Node 7 - 2 connections
Node 8 - 2 connections
Node 9 - 2 connections
Node 4 - 3 connections
Node 6 - 3 connections
Node 3 - 5 connections
Node 0 - 7 connections
Node 2 - 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
