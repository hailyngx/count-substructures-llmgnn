Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices: 1, 3, 8 have 1 connection each.
Vertices: 5, 9 have 2 connections each.
Vertices: 7, 6 have 3 connections each.
Vertices: 2 has 4 connections.
Vertex 4 has 6 connections.
Vertex 0 has 7 connections.

Next, we relabel the vertices:
1 → 0, 3 → 1, 8 → 2, 5 → 3, 9 → 4, 7 → 5, 6 → 6, 2 → 7, 4 → 8, 0 → 9.

Now, we go through each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections:
- Edge (0, 3) forms the triangle <1, 0, 9>.
- Edge (0, 4) forms the triangle <9, 0, 8>.
- Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle as vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 9.
- Edge (2, 1) does not form a triangle as the vertices are labeled in increasing order.
- Edge (2, 6) forms the triangle <7, 2, 6>.
- Edge (2, 7) forms the triangle <7, 2, 5>.
- Edge (3, 0) forms the triangle <1, 0, 9>.
- Edge (4, 0) forms the triangle <9, 0, 8>.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 5.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 6.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 8.
- Edge (4, 9) forms the triangle <9, 0, 8>.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 7.
- Edge (6, 2) forms the triangle <7, 2, 6>.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle as vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 4.
- Edge (6, 7) forms the triangle <7, 2, 6>.
- Edge (7, 2) forms the triangle <7, 2, 5>.
- Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle as vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 5.
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 4.
- Edge (9, 0) forms the triangle <9, 0, 8>.
- Edge (9, 4) forms the triangle <9, 0, 8>.

Counted triangles: 7

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
