Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's first determine the number of connections for each node:

Node 0: 6 connections  
Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 2: 5 connections  
Node 3: 5 connections  
Node 4: 1 connection  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 6: 5 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 9: 5 connections  

We can now sort the nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

Nodes: 1, 4, 5, 8, 7, 2, 3, 6, 9, 0

Now, we iterate through each edge and count the number of triangles:

Triangles:  
<0, 2, 6>  
<0, 2, 9>  
<0, 3, 6>  
<0, 3, 9>  

[Total number of triangles: 4]
