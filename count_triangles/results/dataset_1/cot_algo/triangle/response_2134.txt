Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels are:  

Vertex 1: 4 connections  
Vertex 6: 4 connections  
Vertex 8: 2 connections  
Vertex 0: 3 connections  
Vertex 7: 3 connections  
Vertex 5: 4 connections  
Vertex 3: 6 connections  
Vertex 4: 3 connections  
Vertex 2: 5 connections  
Vertex 9: 6 connections  

Now, let's count the triangles and list them as follows:

1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <1, 2, 6>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <3, 5, 9>
7. <3, 6, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
