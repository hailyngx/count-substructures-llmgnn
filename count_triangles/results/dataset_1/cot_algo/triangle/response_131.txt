Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
Vertices: 3, 9
Vertices: 1, 6
Vertices: 7
Vertices: 0, 2, 5, 8
Vertices: 4

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles based on the sorted vertices:
- (0, 1): Forms a triangle with 2 as the common connection. Triangle <0, 1, 2> found.
- (0, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- (1, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- (4, 5): Forms a triangle with 8 as the common connection. Triangle <4, 5, 8> found.

Output:
