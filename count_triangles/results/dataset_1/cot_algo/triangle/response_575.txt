Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 5, 1, 6, 0, 7, 4, 8, 9, 2, 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles present in the graph. The triangles found are as follows:
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
