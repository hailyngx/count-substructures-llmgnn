Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
After arranging the nodes based on their degree as described, the new numbering of the nodes is: 
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 1
- Node 5: Degree 1
- Node 9: Degree 1
- Node 3: Degree 2
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 7: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 1): Forms triangle with node 7 <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (0, 7): Forms triangle with node 1 <0, 7, 1>
- Edge (1, 7): Forms triangle with node 0 <1, 7, 0>
- Edge (1, 3): No triangle
- Edge (1, 4): Forms triangle with node 8 <1, 4, 8>
- Edge (1, 6): Forms triangle with node 3 <1, 6, 3>
- Edge (2, 8): No triangle
- Edge (3, 6): Forms triangle with node 9 and node 1 <3, 6, 9> <3, 6, 1>
- Edge (4, 8): Forms triangle with node 1 <4,8,1>
- Edge (5, 8): No triangle
- Edge (6, 9): No triangle
- Edge (7, 8): Forms triangle with node 1 <7, 8, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
