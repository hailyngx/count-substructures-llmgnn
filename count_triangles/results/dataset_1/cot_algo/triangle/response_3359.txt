Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 3: 0 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 2: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 6 connections
- Vertex 9: 10 connections

Now, we proceed with checking for triangles:

Triangles:
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 7, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
