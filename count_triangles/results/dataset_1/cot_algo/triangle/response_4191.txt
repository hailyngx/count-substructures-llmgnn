Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The degrees of each vertex are as follows:
- Vertex 0: 1
- Vertex 1: 2
- Vertex 2: 2
- Vertex 3: 4
- Vertex 4: 4
- Vertex 5: 5
- Vertex 6: 1
- Vertex 7: 5
- Vertex 8: 4
- Vertex 9: 4

Therefore, the sorted vertices are:
0 < 6 < 1 < 2 < 8 < 9 < 4 < 3 < 7 < 5

Now, checking for triangles:

- Edge (0, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 5) forms triangles <2, 5, 3> and <2, 5, 8>.
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 5) forms a triangle <3, 5, 7>.
- Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 7) forms triangles <4, 7, 5> and <4, 7, 9>.
- Edge (5, 2) forms triangles <5, 2, 3> and <5, 2, 8>.
- Edge (5, 3) forms a triangle <5, 3, 7>.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 4) forms triangles <7, 4, 5> and <7, 4, 9>.
- Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 5) forms triangles <9, 5, 7> and <9, 5, 8>.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 3, 7>, <5, 2, 3>, <5, 2, 8>, and <9, 5, 7>.
