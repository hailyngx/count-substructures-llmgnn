Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:

0 -> 2 connections
1 -> 3 connections
3 -> 2 connections
4 -> 2 connections
7 -> 3 connections
5 -> 2 connections
6 -> 1 connection
9 -> 5 connections

Analyzing the edges based on the labeling, we see that the following triangles exist:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<7, 5, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles is [8].
