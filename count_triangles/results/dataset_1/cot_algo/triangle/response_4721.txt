Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the order is: 4, 5, 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 2, 7, 9.

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 1): Both vertices have degree 4, so proceed. Shared connection: 7. Triangle: <0, 1, 7>.

2. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has degree 4, which is less than the degree of vertex 9 (3), so proceed. Shared connection: None.

3. Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has degree 4, which is less than the degree of vertex 7 (5), so proceed. Shared connection: 2. Triangle: <1, 7, 2>.

4. Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 has degree 5, which is less than the degree of vertex 7 (5), so proceed. Shared connection: None.

5. Edge (5, 6): Both vertices have degree 1, so no triangle is formed.

6. Edge (6, 8): Both vertices have degree 2, so no triangle is formed.

7. Edge (6, 8): Both vertices have degree 2, so no triangle is formed.

8. Edge (7, 1): Vertex 1 has degree 4, which is less than the degree of vertex 7 (5), so proceed. Shared connection: 2. Triangle: <7, 1, 2>.

9. Edge (7, 2): Vertex 2 has degree 5, which is less than the degree of vertex 7 (5), so proceed. Shared connection: None.

10. Edge (7, 8): Vertex 7 has degree 5, which is less than the degree of vertex 8 (2), so proceed. Shared connection: 6. Triangle: <7, 8, 6>.

11. Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has degree 5, which is less than the degree of vertex 9 (3), so proceed. Shared connection: None.

12. Edge (8, 6): Both vertices have degree 2, so no triangle is formed.

13. Edge (8, 7): Vertex 7 has degree 5, which is less than the degree of vertex 8 (2), so proceed. Shared connection: 6. Triangle: <8, 7, 6>.

14. Edge (9, 0): Vertex 0 has degree 4, which is less than the degree of vertex 9 (3), so proceed. Shared connection: None.

15. Edge (9, 2): Vertex 2 has degree 5, which is less than the degree of vertex 9 (3), so proceed. Shared connection: None.

16. Edge (9, 7): Vertex 7 has degree 5, which is less than the degree of vertex 9 (3), so proceed. Shared connection: None.

Count of triangles = 3
Triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <1, 7, 2>, <7, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
