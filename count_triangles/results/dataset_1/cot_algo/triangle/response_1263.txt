Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
By using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

0 (degree 1)
5 (degree 1)
4 (degree 1)
6 (degree 2)
3 (degree 2)
9 (degree 3)
7 (degree 4)
2 (degree 4)
1 (degree 5)
8 (degree 5)

Next, we will count the triangles formed by the edges based on the ordering of vertices:

- Triangle <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle <1, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
