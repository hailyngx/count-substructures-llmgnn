Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes in order of degrees: 4, 6, 8, 3, 1, 5, 7, 0, 2, 9

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 4 will be labeled as 0
Node 6 will be labeled as 1
Node 8 will be labeled as 2
Node 3 will be labeled as 3
Node 1 will be labeled as 4
Node 5 will be labeled as 5
Node 7 will be labeled as 6
Node 0 will be labeled as 7
Node 2 will be labeled as 8
Node 9 will be labeled as 9

Now, let's list the edges with the lower labeled vertex listed first:
Edges in order: (4, 0) (6, 1) (8, 2) (3, 5) (1, 5) (5, 7) (7, 0) (0, 2) (2, 1) (3, 7) (1, 9) (5, 3) (7, 5) (0, 4) (5, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (0, 6) (1, 2) (5, 7) (3, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (7, 9) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 7) (8, 9)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by the shared connections:
Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles found: <1, 4, 5>, <2, 1, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 8>
