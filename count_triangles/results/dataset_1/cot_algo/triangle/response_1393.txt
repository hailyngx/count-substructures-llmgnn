Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective degrees are:
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections

After sorting by degree, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 8 (label 0) <br>
Node 9 (label 1) <br>
Node 3 (label 2) <br>
Node 5 (label 3) <br>
Node 6 (label 4) <br>
Node 7 (label 5) <br>
Node 0 (label 6) <br>
Node 1 (label 7) <br>
Node 2 (label 8) <br>
Node 4 (label 9) 

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 2> (0, 1, 2) 
- Triangle <0, 1, 4> (0, 1, 4)
- Triangle <0, 4, 5> (0, 4, 5) 

There are a total of [3] triangles in this graph.
