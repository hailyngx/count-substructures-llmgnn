Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by connections:
1. Node 3 (Degree: 0)
2. Node 7 (Degree: 2)
3. Node 8 (Degree: 2)
4. Node 9 (Degree: 2)
5. Node 5 (Degree: 3)
6. Node 1 (Degree: 4)
7. Node 6 (Degree: 4)
8. Node 4 (Degree: 5)
9. Node 2 (Degree: 6)
10. Node 0 (Degree: 6)

Now, we will iterate through the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method and count the number of triangles:

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 6, 2>
3. <0, 7, 2>
4. <0, 8, 4>
5. <1, 2, 9>
6. <2, 4, 5>
7. <2, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [7]
