Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following relabeled vertices:  

Vertex 5: Degree 0  
Vertex 8: Degree 2  
Vertex 0: Degree 3  
Vertex 7: Degree 3  
Vertex 6: Degree 3  
Vertex 1: Degree 4  
Vertex 4: Degree 4  
Vertex 3: Degree 4  
Vertex 2: Degree 5  
Vertex 9: Degree 5  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.  

The total number of triangles is 4, and they are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, and <3, 4, 8>.  

So, the output is:  
[4]
