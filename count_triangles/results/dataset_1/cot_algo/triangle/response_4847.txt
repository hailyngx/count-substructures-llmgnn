Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
0 - 1 connection
4 - 1 connection
7 - 1 connection
9 - 2 connections
1 - 3 connections
2 - 3 connections
6 - 3 connections
5 - 4 connections
8 - 4 connections
3 - 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges in the order specified in the input:

1. Edge (0, 3) - Since vertex 0 has 1 connection and vertex 3 has 5 connections, we proceed.
2. Edge (0, 5) - Proceed.
3. Edge (1, 3) - Proceed. Triangle <0, 1, 3> is found.
4. Edge (1, 6) - Proceed.
5. Edge (1, 9) - Proceed.
6. Edge (2, 5) - Proceed.
7. Edge (2, 6) - Proceed. Triangle <1, 2, 6> is found.
8. Edge (2, 7) - Proceed.
9. Edge (3, 0) - The triangle <0, 1, 3> has already been counted.
10. Edge (3, 1) - The triangle <0, 1, 3> has already been counted.
11. Edge (3, 8) - Proceed. Triangle <1, 3, 8> is found.
12. Edge (4, 5) - Proceed.
13. Edge (4, 8) - Proceed.
14. Edge (5, 0) - The triangle <0, 1, 3> has already been counted.
15. Edge (5, 2) - The triangle <1, 2, 6> has already been counted.
16. Edge (5, 4) - The triangle <0, 4, 5> is found.
17. Edge (5, 8) - Proceed. Triangle <1, 5, 8> is found.
18. Edge (6, 1) - The triangle <1, 2, 6> has already been counted.
19. Edge (6, 2) - The triangle <1, 2, 6> has already been counted.
20. Edge (6, 8) - Proceed. Triangle <1, 6, 8> is found.
21. Edge (7, 2) - Proceed.
22. Edge (7, 9) - Proceed.
23. Edge (8, 3) - The triangle <1, 3, 8> has already been counted.
24. Edge (8, 4) - Proceed.
25. Edge (8, 5) - The triangle <1, 5, 8> has already been counted.
26. Edge (8, 6) - The triangle <1, 6, 8> has already been counted.
27. Edge (9, 1) - The triangle <0, 1, 3> has already been counted.
28. Edge (9, 7) - Proceed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, and <1, 6, 8>.
