Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:
- Node 1 (1 connections): 1
- Node 4 (1 connections): 2
- Node 5 (1 connections): 3
- Node 6 (1 connections): 4
- Node 0 (2 connections): 5
- Node 9 (2 connections): 6
- Node 8 (3 connections): 7
- Node 7 (4 connections): 8
- Node 2 (5 connections): 9
- Node 3 (5 connections): 10

Now, we will iterate through the edges considering the vertices with lower labels and count the number of triangles formed. 

- Edge (0, 7): Node 5 and Node 8 share connections with Node 8 forming a triangle: <5, 7, 8>
- Edge (0, 8): No additional triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 3): No additional triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 5): No additional triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 6): No additional triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 9): No additional triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 4): No additional triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 7): No additional triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 3): No additional triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 2): No additional triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 2): No additional triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 3): Node 8 and Node 10 share connections with Node 10 forming a triangle: <3, 7, 8>
- Edge (7, 8): Node 8 and Node 10 share connections with Node 10 forming a triangle: <7, 8, 10>
- Edge (8, 0): Node 5 and Node 7 share connections with Node 7 forming a triangle: <0, 5, 7>
- Edge (8, 7): Node 5 and Node 8 share connections with Node 8 forming a triangle: <5, 7, 8>
- Edge (9, 2): No additional triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, and <7, 8, 10>.
