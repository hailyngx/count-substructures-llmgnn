Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the vertices, the sorted vertices are as follows:
Nodes: 0, 9, 4, 2, 6, 3, 5, 8, 1, 7

By following the method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles in this graph. 

The total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 3>, <2, 6, 4>.
