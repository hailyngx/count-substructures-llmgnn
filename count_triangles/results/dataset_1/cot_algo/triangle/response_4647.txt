Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0 has 3 connections.
Vertex 2 has 2 connections.
Vertex 8 has 2 connections.
Vertex 4 has 2 connections.
Vertex 6 has 2 connections.
Vertex 9 has 3 connections.
Vertex 7 has 3 connections.
Vertex 1 has 3 connections.
Vertex 3 has 4 connections.
Vertex 5 has 4 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (2, 4) shares connection 2 with vertex 0, forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- (2, 8) does not create a triangle.
- (4, 9) does not create a triangle.
- (6, 7) does not create a triangle.
- (8, 2) shares connection 2 with vertex 0, forming another triangle <0, 2, 8>.
- (8, 7) does not create a triangle.
- (9, 4) does not create a triangle.
- (9, 1) shares connection 1 with vertex 5, forming a triangle <1, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 4> and <1, 5, 9>.
