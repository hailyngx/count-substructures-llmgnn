Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted based on their number of connections are: 
Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 8: 0 connections
Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we check each edge:

1. Edge (0, 9): Both vertices have 1 connection but 0 < 9, so proceed.

2. Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has 4 connections and Vertex 2 has 3 connections, so proceed. No triangle found.

3. Edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 has 4 connections and Vertex 6 has 4 connections, so proceed. No triangle found.

4. Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has 4 connections and Vertex 7 has 3 connections, so proceed. No triangle found.

5. Edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 has 4 connections and Vertex 9 has 7 connections, so proceed. Triangle found: <1, 6, 9>.

6. Edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has 3 connections and Vertex 9 has 7 connections, so proceed. Triangle found: <2, 1, 6>.

7. Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 has 4 connections and Vertex 4 has 2 connections, so proceed. No triangle found.

8. Edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 has 4 connections and Vertex 6 has 4 connections, so proceed. Triangle found: <3, 1, 6>.

9. Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 has 4 connections and Vertex 9 has 7 connections, so proceed. Triangle found: <3, 1, 9>.

10. Edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 has 2 connections and Vertex 6 has 4 connections, so proceed. No triangle found.

11. Edge (6, 1): Vertex 6 has 4 connections and Vertex 1 has 4 connections, so proceed. No triangle found.

12. Edge (6, 3): Vertex 6 has 4 connections and Vertex 3 has 4 connections, so proceed. No triangle found.

13. Edge (6, 4): Vertex 6 has 4 connections and Vertex 4 has 2 connections, so proceed. No triangle found.

14. Edge (6, 9): Both vertices have 4 connections but 6 < 9, so proceed. No triangle found.

15. Edge (7, 1): Vertex 7 has 3 connections and Vertex 1 has 4 connections, so proceed. No triangle found.

16. Edge (9, 0): Both vertices have 7 connections but 0 < 9, so proceed. No triangle found.

17. Edge (9, 1): Vertex 9 has 7 connections and Vertex 1 has 4 connections, so proceed. Triangle found: <9, 1, 6>.

18. Edge (9, 2): Vertex 9 has 7 connections and Vertex 2 has 3 connections, so proceed. No triangle found.

19. Edge (9, 3): Vertex 9 has 7 connections and Vertex 3 has 4 connections, so proceed. No triangle found.

20. Edge (9, 6): Vertex 9 has 7 connections and Vertex 6 has 4 connections, so proceed. No triangle found.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
