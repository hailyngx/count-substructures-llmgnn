Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given graph:

Number of nodes: 10
Number of edges: 18
Edges: (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 4), (2, 9), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 8), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 2), (9, 6)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 1: 1 connection
