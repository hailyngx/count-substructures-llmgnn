Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By arranging the vertices in increasing order based on their degrees, we get the following new labels: 
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph and count the triangles formed:

- Edge (1, 2) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <1, 4, 5>
- Edge (2, 1) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (4, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 2: <2, 4, 6>
- Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <4, 7, 9>
- Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (5, 2) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (5, 4) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (7, 3) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (8, 5) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (9, 4) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle with any other vertices.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <1, 4, 5> and <2, 4, 6>.
