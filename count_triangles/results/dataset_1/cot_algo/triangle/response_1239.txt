Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree from least to most connections, the new ordering is: (2, 0, 5, 3, 6, 7, 9, 1, 4, 8).

Now, we can analyze each edge based on the degree-based ordering:

- Edge (2, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (0, 1): Triangle <0, 1, 8>.
- Edge (5, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 1): Triangle <3, 1, 8>.
- Edge (6, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 0): No triangles formed.

Finally, we count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 8>, <3, 1, 8>.
