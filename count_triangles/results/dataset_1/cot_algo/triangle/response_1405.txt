Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 1-8, 0-3, 9-5, 2-4, 6-6, 7-7, 8-5, 3-4, 4-5, 5-5. 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (2, 4): Since both vertices have 4 connections, we proceed. They share connections with vertices 5 and 6, forming the triangle <2, 4, 6>.

2. Edge (2, 6): Since vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 6, we proceed. They share connections with vertices 4 and 7, forming the triangle <2, 6, 4>.

3. Edge (2, 9): Since vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 9, we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 4, forming the triangle <2, 9, 4>.

4. Edge (3, 0): Since both vertices have 3 connections, we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 5, forming the triangle <3, 0, 5>.

5. Edge (4, 2): Vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 2, so we skip this edge.

6. Edge (4, 5): Since both vertices have 5 connections, we proceed. They share connections with vertices 2 and 6, forming the triangle <4, 5, 2>.

7. Edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 6, so we skip this edge.

8. Edge (4, 9): Since vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 9, we skip this edge.

9. Edge (5, 3): Vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 3, so we skip this edge.

10. Edge (5, 4): Vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 4, so we skip this edge.

11. Edge (5, 7): Since both vertices have 7 connections, we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 2, forming the triangle <5, 7, 2>.

12. Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 8, so we skip this edge.

13. Edge (6, 2): Vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 2, so we skip this edge.

14. Edge (6, 4): Vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 4, so we skip this edge.

15. Edge (6, 7): Since both vertices have 7 connections, we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 2, forming the triangle <6, 7, 2>.

16. Edge (6, 8): Since vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 8, we skip this edge.

17. Edge (7, 1): Vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 1, so we skip this edge.

18. Edge (7, 2): Vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 2, so we skip this edge.

19. Edge (7, 5): Vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 5, so we skip this edge.

20. Edge (7, 6): Since both vertices have 7 connections, we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 2, forming the triangle <7, 6, 2>.

21. Edge (8, 1): Vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 1, so we skip this edge.

22. Edge (8, 5): Vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 5, so we skip this edge.

23. Edge (8, 6): Vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 6, so we skip this edge.

24. Edge (9, 0): Vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 0, so we skip this edge.

25. Edge (9, 2): Vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 2, so we skip this edge.

26. Edge (9, 4): Since both vertices have 5 connections, we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 2, forming the triangle <9, 4, 2>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
