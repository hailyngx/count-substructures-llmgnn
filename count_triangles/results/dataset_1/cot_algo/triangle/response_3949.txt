Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 1, 0, 9, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 2, 3

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on the sorting:
Vertex 1 (0): 0
Vertex 0 (3): 1
Vertex 9 (6): 2
Vertex 5 (3): 3
Vertex 4 (2): 4
Vertex 6 (3): 5
Vertex 8 (4): 6
Vertex 7 (5): 7
Vertex 2 (4): 8
Vertex 3 (4): 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles by considering each edge.

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 8>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [5]
