Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. Here is the list of vertices in ascending order of their degrees:

Vertices: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9, 5, 4, 2, 8

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the degree ordering. Since we are looking for triangles, we will check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

1. (0, 8): No triangles
2. (1, 2): No triangles
3. (1, 8): No triangles
4. (2, 1): No triangles
5. (2, 4): No triangles
6. (2, 7): No triangles
7. (3, 8): No triangles
8. (3, 9): No triangles
9. (4, 2): No triangles
10. (4, 5): <2, 4, 5>
11. (4, 8): No triangles
12. (4, 9): No triangles
13. (5, 4): <2, 4, 5>
14. (5, 7): No triangles
15. (5, 8): No triangles
16. (5, 9): No triangles
17. (7, 2): No triangles
18. (7, 5): No triangles
19. (8, 0): No triangles
20. (8, 1): No triangles
21. (8, 3): No triangles
22. (8, 4): No triangles
23. (8, 5): No triangles
24. (9, 3): No triangles
25. (9, 4): No triangles
26. (9, 5): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles: <2, 4, 5>
