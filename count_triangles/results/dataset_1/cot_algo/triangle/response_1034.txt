Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, then assigning new labels to the vertices accordingly. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their corresponding degrees:

Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 0
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2

Following the method, we will start counting triangles:

For edge (0, 3):
Node 0 < Node 3
Shared connections: None

For edge (0, 4):
Node 0 < Node 4
Shared connections: None

For edge (0, 7):
Node 0 < Node 7
Shared connections: None

For edge (2, 5):
Node 2 < Node 5
Shared connections: None

For edge (2, 6):
Node 2 < Node 6
Shared connections: None

For edge (2, 7):
Node 2 < Node 7
Shared connections: None

For edge (2, 8):
Node 2 < Node 8
Shared connections: None

For edge (3, 9):
Node 3 = Node 9
Shared connections: 5

For edge (4, 6):
Node 4 < Node 6
Shared connections: None

For edge (5, 9):
Node 5 < Node 9
Shared connections: None

For edge (5, 8):
Node 5 < Node 8
Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <3, 5, 9>
