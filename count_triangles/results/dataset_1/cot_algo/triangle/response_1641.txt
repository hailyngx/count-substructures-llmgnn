Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles and output the result.

Triangles:
[8 triangles]

Unique triangles:
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 7, 2>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 6>
