Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:
1. For edge (0, 3), we can form a triangle <0, 3, 1>.
2. For edge (1, 3), we can form a triangle <1, 3, 5>.
Total triangles: [2]
