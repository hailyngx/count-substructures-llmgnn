Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we get the following relabeling: 

Vertices: 
1. Node 8 (Degree: 0)
2. Node 2 (Degree: 1)
3. Node 9 (Degree: 2)
4. Node 4 (Degree: 2)
5. Node 5 (Degree: 2)
6. Node 1 (Degree: 2)
7. Node 3 (Degree: 3)
8. Node 6 (Degree: 4)
9. Node 7 (Degree: 6)
10. Node 0 (Degree: 7)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. (1, 5): No triangle
2. (1, 6): No triangle
3. (2, 7): No triangle
4. (3, 7): No triangle
5. (6, 0): Triangle <0, 3, 6>
6. (6, 1): No triangle
7. (6, 4): No triangle
8. (7, 0): No triangle
9. (7, 2): No triangle
10. (7, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 7>
11. (7, 4): Triangle <0, 4, 7>
12. (9, 0): No triangle
13. (9, 5): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [3] 
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 7>
