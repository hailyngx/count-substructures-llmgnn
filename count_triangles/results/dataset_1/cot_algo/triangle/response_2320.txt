Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of vertices with their corresponding degree:
- Vertex 2: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 5
- Vertex 0: degree 5
- Vertex 7: degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles:
- For the edge (0, 1): Common connections with 3, 7, 9 -> Triangle <0, 1, 3> found.
- For the edge (0, 3): Common connections with 1, 6, 7 -> Triangle <0, 3, 6> found.
- For the edge (0, 7): Common connections with 1, 3, 9 -> Triangle <0, 7, 9> found.
- For the edge (0, 9): Common connections with 1, 4, 7 -> Triangle <0, 4, 9> found.
- For the edge (1, 5): No triangles.
- For the edge (1, 6): Common connections with 3, 7 -> Triangle <1, 3, 6> found.
- For the edge (1, 7): Common connections with 0, 3, 5, 6, 9 -> Triangles <0, 1, 7> and <1, 5, 7> found.
- For the edge (1, 9): Common connections with 0, 4, 7 -> Triangle <0, 1, 9> found.

The total number of triangles is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 5, 7>.
