Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertex 6: 0 connections
Vertices 1 and 9: 1 connection
Vertices 3 and 5: 2 connections
Vertices 7 and 8: 3 connections
Vertices 0 and 4: 6 connections
Vertices 2: 7 connections

Now, let's go through the edges and count the number of triangles:

Consider edge (0, 2):
- Both vertices 0 and 2 have 6 and 7 connections respectively.
- They share connections with vertices 3, 4, 7, and 8.
- This forms four triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>.

Consider edge (0, 3):
- Both vertices 0 and 3 have 6 and 2 connections respectively.
- They share connections with vertices 7 and 8.
- This forms two triangles: <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>.

Consider edge (0, 4):
- Both vertices 0 and 4 have 6 and 6 connections respectively.
- They share connections with vertices 1, 5, and 8.
- This forms three triangles: <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>.

Consider edge (0, 7):
- Both vertices 0 and 7 have 6 and 3 connections respectively.
- They share connections with vertices 2, 3, and 8.
- This forms three triangles: <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 8>.

Consider edge (0, 8):
- Both vertices 0 and 8 have 6 and 3 connections respectively.
- They share connections with vertices 3 and 4.
- This forms one triangle: <0, 8, 3>.

Adding up all the triangles, we have:
[13]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 3>.
