Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 5: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 3): No triangles can be formed with these vertices.
2. Edge (1, 5): Triangle <1, 5, 2> is formed.
3. Edge (1, 9): No triangles can be formed with these vertices.
4. Edge (2, 4): Triangle <2, 4, 5> is formed.
5. Edge (2, 5): Triangle <2, 5, 4> is formed.
6. Edge (2, 7): Triangle <2, 7, 4> is formed.
7. Edge (3, 8): No triangles can be formed with these vertices.
8. Edge (4, 6): No triangles can be formed with these vertices.
9. Edge (4, 7): Triangle <4, 7, 2> is formed.
10. Edge (5, 6): Triangle <5, 6, 4> is formed.
11. Edge (6, 8): Triangle <6, 8, 7> is formed.
12. Edge (6, 9): No triangles can be formed with these vertices.
13. Edge (7, 8): No triangles can be formed with these vertices.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 2>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 7, 4>, <4, 7, 2>, <5, 6, 4>.
