Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for each vertex are: 
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

1. Looking at edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 (Node with 4 connections) has fewer connections than Vertex 2 (Node with 5 connections). No triangle is formed.

2. Looking at edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 (Node with 4 connections) has fewer connections than Vertex 4 (Node with 5 connections). 
   Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5, Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7. 
   Triangle <1, 2, 4> is found.

3. Looking at edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 (Node with 4 connections) has fewer connections than Vertex 5 (Node with 5 connections).
   Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5, Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 8, and 9. 
   Triangle <1, 3, 5> is found.

4. Looking at edge (2, 1): Skip as the condition is not met.

5. Looking at edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 (Node with 5 connections) has fewer connections than Vertex 3 (Node with 3 connections).
   Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8, Node 3 is connected to nodes 5. 
   Triangle <2, 1, 3> is found.

6. Continuing this process for all the edges, we find:
   - Triangle <1, 2, 5>
   - Triangle <1, 5, 6>
   - Triangle <1, 5, 8>
   - Triangle <2, 3, 5>
   - Triangle <4, 0, 6>
   - Triangle <4, 1, 6>
   - Triangle <4, 6, 5>
   - Triangle <5, 6, 8>
   - Triangle <8, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
