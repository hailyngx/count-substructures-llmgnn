Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each node has:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:
Degree 1: Node 5, Node 9
Degree 2: Node 7
Degree 3: Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 8
Degree 4: Node 0, Node 6
Degree 5: Node 1

Now, let's go through the edges in the graph and count the triangles:
(0, 1): None
(0, 3): None
(0, 6): None
(0, 8): None
(1, 0): None
(1, 2): None
(1, 3): None
(1, 4): None
(1, 5): None
(1, 7): None
(2, 1): None
(2, 6): None
(2, 9): None
(3, 0): None
(3, 1): None
(3, 8): None
(4, 1): None
(4, 6): None
(4, 8): None
(5, 1): None
(6, 0): None
(6, 2): None
(6, 4): None
(6, 7): None
(7, 1): None
(7, 6): None
(8, 0): None
(8, 3): None
(8, 4): None
(9, 2): None

There are no triangles in this graph, so the total number of triangles is 0. Hence, the output is [0].
