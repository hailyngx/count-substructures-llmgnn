Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices and their corresponding degrees:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 5
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 5
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 4

Next, we'll relabel the vertices in increasing order of their degrees:
- Vertex 0: label 0
- Vertex 5: label 1
- Vertex 6: label 2
- Vertex 8: label 3
- Vertex 7: label 4
- Vertex 1: label 5
- Vertex 3: label 6
- Vertex 9: label 7
- Vertex 2: label 8
- Vertex 4: label 9

Now, we'll iterate through the edges and count the triangles formed by each edge:
- Edge (0, 4) forms one triangle: <0, 4, 7>
- Edge (0, 7) does not form any triangles (vertex 7 has a higher label than 0)
- Edge (1, 2) forms one triangle: <1, 2, 4>
- Edge (1, 3) forms one triangle: <1, 3, 6>
- Edge (1, 4) forms one triangle: <1, 4, 7>
- Edge (2, 1) does not form any triangles (vertex 1 has a higher label than 2)
- Edge (2, 4) forms one triangle: <2, 4, 7>
- Edge (2, 5) does not form any triangles (vertex 5 has a higher label than 2)
- Edge (2, 8) does not form any triangles (vertex 8 has a higher label than 2)
- Edge (2, 9) forms one triangle: <2, 4, 9>
- Edge (3, 1) does not form any triangles (vertex 1 has a higher label than 3)
- Edge (3, 6) does not form any triangles (vertex 6 has a higher label than 3)
- Edge (3, 8) does not form any triangles (vertex 8 has a higher label than 3)
- Edge (4, 0) forms one triangle: <0, 4, 7>
- Edge (4, 1) forms one triangle: <1, 4, 7>
- Edge (4, 2) forms one triangle: <2, 4, 7>
- Edge (4, 7) does not form any triangles (vertex 7 has a higher label than 4)
- Edge (4, 9) forms one triangle: <2, 4, 9>
- Edge (5, 2) does not form any triangles (vertex 5 has a higher label than 2)
- Edge (5, 6) does not form any triangles (vertex 6 has a higher label than 5)
- Edge (6, 3) does not form any triangles (vertex 6 has a higher label than 3)
- Edge (6, 5) does not form any triangles (vertex 6 has a higher label than 5)
- Edge (7, 0) does not form any triangles (vertex 7 has a higher label than 0)
- Edge (7, 4) does not form any triangles (vertex 7 has a higher label than 4)
- Edge (7, 9) does not form any triangles (vertex 7 has a higher label than 9)
- Edge (8, 2) does not form any triangles (vertex 8 has a higher label than 2)
- Edge (8, 3) does not form any triangles (vertex 8 has a higher label than 3)
- Edge (9, 2) does not form any triangles (vertex 9 has a higher label than 2)
- Edge (9, 4) does not form any triangles (vertex 9 has a higher label than 4)
- Edge (9, 7) does not form any triangles (vertex 9 has a higher label than 7)

Count of triangles in the graph: [4]
Triangles found: <0, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 9>
