Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 2

Next, we sort the nodes by their degree in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

- Node 2 (degree 1) -> relabeled as Node 0
- Node 5 (degree 1) -> relabeled as Node 1
- Node 7 (degree 1) -> relabeled as Node 2
- Node 9 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 3
- Node 0 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 4
- Node 1 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 5
- Node 4 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 6
- Node 6 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Node 7
- Node 3 (degree 4) -> relabeled as Node 8

Now, we go through the edges one by one and count the triangles:

- Edge (2, 4): No triangles.
- Edge (5, 3): No triangles.
- Edge (7, 6): No triangles.
- Edge (3, 6): Triangle <3, 6, 7>.
- Edge (1, 9): No triangles.
- Edge (0, 9): No triangles.
- Edge (4, 2): No triangles.
- Edge (1, 6): No triangles.
- Edge (3, 0): Triangle <0, 3, 4>.
- Edge (6, 1): No triangles.
- Edge (4, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 4>.
- Edge (6, 3): Triangle <3, 6, 7>.
- Edge (9, 0): No triangles.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangles.
- Edge (1, 9): No triangles.
- Edge (0, 3): No triangles.
- Edge (3, 4): Triangle <0, 3, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 3, and the unique triangles found are <3, 6, 7>, <0, 3, 4>.
