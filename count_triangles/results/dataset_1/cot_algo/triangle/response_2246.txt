Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Nodes sorted by their number of connections:
0 (degree 3), 5 (degree 3), 2 (degree 3), 7 (degree 3), 8 (degree 2), 9 (degree 2), 6 (degree 2), 3 (degree 1), 4 (degree 1)

Triangles found using Degree-Based Ordering method:
[9]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9]. 
Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 9> <0, 8, 9> <2, 7, 4> <2, 7, 6> <5, 0, 9> <5, 6, 7> <0, 8, 2> <0, 5, 9> <0, 9, 5>.
