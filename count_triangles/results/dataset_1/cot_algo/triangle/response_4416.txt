Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 7: 0 connections
Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7: 1 connection each
Nodes 0, 8: 2 connections each
Nodes 1, 5, 9: 5 connections each

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their number of connections:

Node 7: 0 (previously 7)
Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Nodes 0, 8: 6, 7
Nodes 1, 5, 9: 8, 9, 10

To count the triangles, we will go through the edges in the order specified:

1. (0, 5): Node 6 (0) has 2 connections, Node 9 (5) has 5 connections. No triangles.
2. (1, 2): Node 8 (1) has 5 connections, Node 1 (2) has 1 connection. Triangle <1, 2, 8>.
3. (1, 3): Node 8 (1) has 5 connections, Node 2 (3) has 1 connection. No triangles.
4. (1, 8): Node 8 (1) has 5 connections, Node 1 (8) has 2 connections. No triangles.
5. (1, 9): Node 8 (1) has 5 connections, Node 10 (9) has 5 connections. Triangle <1, 9, 10>.
6. (2, 5): Node 1 (2) has 1 connection, Node 9 (5) has 5 connections. No triangles.
7. (2, 5): Node 1 (2) has 1 connection, Node 9 (5) has 5 connections. No triangles.
8. (3, 1): Node 2 (3) has 1 connection, Node 8 (1) has 5 connections. No triangles.
9. (4, 9): Node 5 (4) has 1 connection, Node 10 (9) has 5 connections. No triangles.
10. (5, 0): Node 9 (5) has 5 connections, Node 6 (0) has 2 connections. No triangles.
11. (5, 2): Node 9 (5) has 5 connections, Node 1 (2) has 1 connection. Triangle <1, 2, 9>.
12. (5, 8): Node 9 (5) has 5 connections, Node 1 (8) has 2 connections. Triangle <1, 8, 9>.
13. (5, 9): Node 9 (5) has 5 connections, Node 10 (9) has 5 connections. Triangle <5, 9, 10>.
14. (5, 9): Node 9 (5) has 5 connections, Node 10 (9) has 5 connections. No additional triangles.
15. (6, 9): Node 0 (6) has 2 connections, Node 10 (9) has 5 connections. No triangles.
16. (8, 1): Node 1 (8) has 2 connections, Node 8 (1) has 5 connections. No triangles.
17. (8, 5): Node 1 (8) has 2 connections, Node 9 (5) has 5 connections. Triangle <1, 5, 9>.
18. (9, 1): Node 10 (9) has 5 connections, Node 8 (1) has 5 connections. No triangles.
19. (9, 4): Node 10 (9) has 5 connections, Node 5 (4) has 1 connection. No triangles.
20. (9, 5): Node 10 (9) has 5 connections, Node 9 (5) has 5 connections. No additional triangles.
21. (9, 6): Node 10 (9) has 5 connections, Node 0 (6) has 2 connections. No triangles.

There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph: <1, 2, 8>, <1, 9, 10>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 9>. So, the output is [4].
