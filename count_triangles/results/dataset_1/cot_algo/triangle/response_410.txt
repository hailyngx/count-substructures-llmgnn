Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes by their degree in ascending order:
- Node 7: degree 0
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 0
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5

Now, we will go through each edge in the order specified and count the triangles:
- Edge (1, 4): Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 4, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (1, 9): Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 9, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (2, 4): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 4, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (2, 5): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 5, and they share Node 4, forming a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
- Edge (2, 6): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 6, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 4, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (3, 5): Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 5, and they share Node 4, forming a triangle <3, 4, 5>.
- Edge (3, 9): Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 9, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (4, 1): Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 4, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (4, 2): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 4, and they share Node 1, forming a triangle <1, 2, 4>.
- Edge (4, 3): Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 4, and they share Node 5, forming a triangle <3, 4, 5>.
- Edge (4, 6): Node 4 has fewer connections than Node 6, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (5, 2): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 5, and they share Node 4, forming a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
- Edge (5, 3): Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 5, and they share Node 4, forming a triangle <3, 4, 5>.
- Edge (5, 6): Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 6, and they share Node 4, forming a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
- Edge (5, 8): Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 8, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (6, 2): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 6, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (6, 4): Node 4 has fewer connections than Node 6, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (6, 5): Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 6, and they share Node 4, forming a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
- Edge (6, 8): Node 6 has fewer connections than Node 8, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (8, 5): Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 8, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (8, 6): Node 6 has fewer connections than Node 8, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (9, 1): Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 9, but they do not share any connections.
- Edge (9, 3): Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 9, but they do not share any connections.

Count of triangles: 4
Unique triangles: <2, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 6> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
