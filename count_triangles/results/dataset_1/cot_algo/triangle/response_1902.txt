Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labeling is as follows: <1, 3, 0, 5, 4, 7, 2, 9, 6, 8>. 

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:
1. Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
2. Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
8. Edge (3, 1) does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (4, 2) forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
10. Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
11. Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.
12. Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
13. Edge (5, 2) does not form a triangle.
14. Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
15. Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
16. Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
17. Edge (7, 2) does not form a triangle.
18. Edge (7, 4) forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
19. Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle.
20. Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle.
21. Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle.
22. Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle.
23. Edge (9, 4) does not form a triangle.
24. Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.

The total number of triangles is [3], and the unique triangles found are <2, 4, 7>.
