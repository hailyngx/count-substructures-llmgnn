Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by degree:
1. 5 connections: 0, 1
2. 4 connections: 9
3. 3 connections: 3, 4, 7
4. 2 connections: 6, 8
5. 1 connection: 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:
Vertex 0 (5 connections) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 1 (5 connections) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 9 (4 connections) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 3 (3 connections) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 4 (3 connections) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 7 (3 connections) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 6 (2 connections) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 8 (2 connections) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 5 (1 connection) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will check for triangles based on the given edges:

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [11]
