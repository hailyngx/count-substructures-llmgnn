Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
We will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's sort the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most:
- Vertex 4: 0 connections
- Vertex 0 & 4: 1 connection each
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 5 & 6: 3 connections each
- Vertex 8: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 5 connections
- Vertex 3 & 9: 5 connections each
- Vertex 2: 6 connections

Now, let's relabel the vertices according to their degrees:
- Node 4 (0 connections)
- Node 0 (1 connection)
- Node 4 (1 connection)
- Node 7 (2 connections)
- Node 5 (3 connections)
- Node 6 (3 connections)
- Node 8 (4 connections)
- Node 1 (5 connections)
- Node 3 (5 connections)
- Node 9 (5 connections)
- Node 2 (6 connections)

Now, looking at each edge, let's count the number of triangles formed:
- (0, 9): No triangles
- (1, 2): No triangles
- (1, 5): No triangles
- (1, 6): No triangles
- (2, 1): No triangles
- (2, 3): No triangles
- (2, 6): No triangles
- (2, 9): No triangles
- (3, 2): No triangles
- (3, 8): No triangles
- (3, 9): No triangles
- (5, 1): No triangles
- (5, 7): No triangles
- (6, 1): No triangles
- (6, 2): No triangles
- (7, 5): No triangles
- (7, 8): No triangles
- (8, 3): No triangles
- (8, 7): No triangles
- (9, 0): No triangles
- (9, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 9>
- (9, 3): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 1, which is represented as [1] in brackets. The unique triangle found is <0, 2, 9>.
