Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we have the following order: (from least connected to most connected)
0, 9, 2, 6, 8, 1, 5, 7, 4, 3

Examining the edges based on the sorted order:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 6 is connected to node 7.
- Node 8 is connected to node 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.

Calculating the triangles:
- Triangles involving node 0: None
- Triangles involving node 9: None
- Triangles involving node 2: None
- Triangles involving node 6: None
- Triangles involving node 8: None
- Triangles involving node 1: None
- Triangles involving node 5: <1, 2, 4>
- Triangles involving node 7: <3, 4, 7>
- Triangles involving node 4: None
- Triangles involving node 3: None

Total number of triangles: [2]
