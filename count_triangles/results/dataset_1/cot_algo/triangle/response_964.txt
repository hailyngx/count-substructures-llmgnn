Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Node 3 - 0 connections
Node 8 - 1 connection
Node 0 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 2 connections
Node 6 - 2 connections
Node 9 - 2 connections
Node 1 - 3 connections
Node 7 - 4 connections
Node 2 - 5 connections
Node 4 - 5 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 2): Forms triangles with vertices 4 and 9. Triangle: <0, 2, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 9): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (1, 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 8. Triangle: <1, 7, 8>.
5. Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (2, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 6. Triangle: <2, 4, 6>.
7. Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (3, 7): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 9. Triangle: <4, 7, 9>.
11. Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
