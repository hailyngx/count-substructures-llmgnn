Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
(1) - 1 connection
(0, 1, 4, 7) - 2 connections
(2, 5, 6, 9) - 3 connections
(3, 8) - 5 connections

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method on the given graph with the above ordering, the total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
