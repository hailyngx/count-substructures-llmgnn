Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the relabeled graph is as follows:
Nodes: 4, 7, 3, 1, 0, 2, 6, 8, 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze each edge:
- Edge (0, 2): Forms a triangle with node 6. Triangle: <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (0, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 6. Triangle: <0, 5, 1>
- Edge (0, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 6. Triangle: <1, 5, 0>
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 5): Forms a triangle with node 6. Triangle: <3, 5, 6>
- Edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 0): Forms a triangle with node 1. Triangle: <5, 0, 1>
- Edge (5, 1): Forms a triangle with node 0. Triangle: <5, 1, 0>
- Edge (5, 3): Forms a triangle with node 6. Triangle: <5, 3, 6>
- Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 4): No triangles formed.

The total number of triangles is [4] (four triangles in total).
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 1>
<1, 5, 0>
<3, 5, 6>
