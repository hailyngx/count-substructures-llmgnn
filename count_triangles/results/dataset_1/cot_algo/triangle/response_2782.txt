Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph with vertices relabeled is as follows:
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Sorted by degree: 1, 4, 8, 9, 0, 3, 7, 5, 6, 2

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges to count the triangles formed:

- Edge (0, 5):
  - Shared connections: None

- Edge (0, 6):
  - Shared connections: 2

- Edge (0, 7):
  - Shared connections: 2

- Edge (0, 8):
  - Shared connections: None

- Edge (1, 2):
  - Shared connections: None

- Edge (2, 3):
  - Shared connections: None

- Edge (2, 4):
  - Shared connections: None

- Edge (2, 6):
  - Shared connections: 0, 3

- Edge (2, 7):
  - Shared connections: 0, 3

- Edge (3, 6):
  - Shared connections: None

- Edge (5, 9):
  - Shared connections: None

- Edge (7, 9):
  - Shared connections: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 6, 2> <0, 7, 2> <3, 6, 2>.
