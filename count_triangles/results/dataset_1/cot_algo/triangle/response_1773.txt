Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices:
Node 0 is connected to 2 nodes.
Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes.
Node 5 is connected to 2 nodes.
Node 2 is connected to 1 node.
Node 4 is connected to 2 nodes.
Node 9 is connected to 2 nodes.
Node 6 is connected to 3 nodes.
Node 7 is connected to 4 nodes.
Node 8 is connected to 5 nodes.
Node 3 is connected to 6 nodes. 

Based on these connections, we will analyze the edges to find triangles. Since we are only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will analyze the following edges:

(0, 3)
(0, 5)
(1, 3)
(1, 4)
(2, 7)
(4, 1)
(5, 8)
(6, 7)
(7, 2)
(8, 9)

Analyzing each edge to find triangles:
(0, 3): Shared connections with 5 and 8 form a triangle <0, 3, 5>.
(0, 5): No additional triangle.
(1, 3): Shared connection with 4 forms a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
(1, 4): No additional triangle.
(2, 7): No additional triangle.
(4, 1): No additional triangle.
(5, 8): No additional triangle.
(6, 7): No additional triangle.
(7, 2): No additional triangle.
(8, 9): Shared connection with 6 forms a triangle <6, 8, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <6, 8, 9>.
