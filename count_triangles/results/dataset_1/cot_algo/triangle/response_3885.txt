Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the relabeling would be as follows:

- Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 7 (degree 3)
- Node 3 (degree 3)
- Node 4 (degree 3)
- Node 2 (degree 3)
- Node 8 (degree 1)
- Node 0 (degree 5)
- Node 9 (degree 4)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 4)

Then, based on the degree-based ordering rule, we will consider each edge to count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>.
