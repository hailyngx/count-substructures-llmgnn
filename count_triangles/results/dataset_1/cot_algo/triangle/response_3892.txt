Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following order: 

Nodes: 1(3), 2(3), 7(3), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 8(4), 3(5), 9(6), 0(7)

Now, we will consider the edges according to the degree-based ordering method to count the triangles.

Triangles: [11]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
