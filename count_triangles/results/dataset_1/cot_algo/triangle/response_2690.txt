Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices from least to most connections, we get the following order: 6, 7, 2, 5, 9, 0, 1, 4, 3, 8.

Now, we will count the number of triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 4):
   - Vertex 0 has connections with 4, 5, and 8.
   - Vertex 4 has connections with 0, 1, and 3.
   - Shared connection: 0 and 4 have a shared connection with vertex 1.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 4> is found.

2. Edge (0, 5):
   - Vertex 0 has connections with 4, 5, and 8.
   - Vertex 5 has connections with 0, 1, and 3.
   - Shared connection: 0 and 5 have a shared connection with vertex 1.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 5> is found.

3. Edge (0, 8):
   - Vertex 0 has connections with 4, 5, and 8.
   - Vertex 8 has connections with 0, 1, 2, and 3.
   - Shared connection: 0 and 8 have a shared connection with vertex 1.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 8> is found.

4. Edge (1, 2):
   - Vertex 1 has connections with 2, 4, 5, and 8.
   - Vertex 2 has connections with 1 and 8.
   - No triangle is formed.

5. Edge (1, 4):
   - Vertex 1 has connections with 2, 4, 5, and 8.
   - Vertex 4 has connections with 0, 1, and 3.
   - Shared connection: 1 and 4 have shared connections with vertices 0 and 3.
   - Triangles <1, 0, 4> and <1, 3, 4> are found.

6. Edge (1, 5):
   - Vertex 1 has connections with 2, 4, 5, and 8.
   - Vertex 5 has connections with 0, 1, and 3.
   - Shared connection: 1 and 5 have a shared connection with vertex 0.
   - Triangle <1, 0, 5> is found.

7. Edge (1, 8):
   - Vertex 1 has connections with 2, 4, 5, and 8.
   - Vertex 8 has connections with 0, 1, 2, and 3.
   - Shared connection: 1 and 8 have a shared connection with vertex 0.
   - Triangle <1, 0, 8> is found.

8. Edge (2, 8):
   - Vertex 2 has connections with 1 and 8.
   - Vertex 8 has connections with 0, 1, 2, and 3.
   - No triangle is formed.

9. Edge (3, 4):
   - Vertex 3 has connections with 4, 5, 7, and 8.
   - Vertex 4 has connections with 0, 1, and 3.
   - Shared connection: 3 and 4 have a shared connection with vertex 1.
   - Triangle <3, 1, 4> is found.

10. Edge (3, 5):
   - Vertex 3 has connections with 4, 5, 7, and 8.
   - Vertex 5 has connections with 0, 1, and 3.
   - Shared connection: 3 and 5 have a shared connection with vertex 0.
   - Triangle <3, 0, 5> is found.

11. Edge (3, 7):
   - Vertex 3 has connections with 4, 5, 7, and 8.
   - Vertex 7 has connections with 3 and 6.
   - No triangle is formed.

12. Edge (3, 8):
   - Vertex 3 has connections with 4, 5, 7, and 8.
   - Vertex 8 has connections with 0, 1, 2, and 3.
   - Shared connection: 3 and 8 have a shared connection with vertex 1.
   - Triangle <3, 1, 8> is found.

We have found 7 triangles in total: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 0, 4>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 0, 8>, <3, 1, 8>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
