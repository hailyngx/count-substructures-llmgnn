Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeling:
Nodes: 
0 (degree 3) -> A
3 (degree 1) -> B
4 (degree 1) -> C
6 (degree 2) -> D
2 (degree 3) -> E
8 (degree 4) -> F
1 (degree 4) -> G
7 (degree 4) -> H
9 (degree 6) -> I

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. Edge (A, G): A (0) and G (1) share a connection with I (9) forming the triangle <0, 1, 9>.
2. Edge (A, H): A (0) and H (2) share a connection with I (9) forming the triangle <0, 7, 9>.
3. Edge (A, I): A (0) and I (1) share a connection with G (1) forming the triangle <0, 1, 9>.
4. Edge (B, E): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (C, I): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (D, H): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (D, I): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (D, H): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (E, F): E (2) and F (3) share a connection with G (1) forming the triangle <1, 8, 2>.
10. Edge (E, I): E (2) and I (1) share a connection with G (1) forming the triangle <1, 8, 2>.
11. Edge (E, I): E (2) and I (1) share a connection with G (1) forming the triangle <1, 8, 2>.
12. Edge (F, G): F (3) and G (4) share a connection with I (9) forming the triangle <1, 7, 9>.
13. Edge (F, H): F (3) and H (2) share a connection with G (1) forming the triangle <1, 8, 7>.
14. Edge (F, I): F (3) and I (1) share a connection with G (1) forming the triangle <1, 8, 2>.
15. Edge (G, A): A (0) and G (4) share a connection with I (9) forming the triangle <0, 7, 9>.
16. Edge (G, B): G (4) and B (0) share a connection with I (9) forming the triangle <0, 1, 9>.
17. Edge (G, I): G (4) and I (1) share a connection with F (3) forming the triangle <1, 7, 9>.
18. Edge (H, A): A (0) and H (2) share a connection with I (9) forming the triangle <0, 7, 9>.
19. Edge (H, D): H (2) and D (0) share a connection with I (9) forming the triangle <0, 7, 9>.
20. Edge (H, F): H (2) and F (3) share a connection with G (1) forming the triangle <1, 8, 7>.
21. Edge (I, A): A (0) and I (1) share a connection with G (1) forming the triangle <0, 1, 9>.
22. Edge (I, D): I (1) and D (0) share a connection with G (1) forming the triangle <0, 1, 9>.
23. Edge (I, F): F (3) and I (1) share a connection with G (1) forming the triangle <1, 8, 2>.
24. Edge (I, F): F (3) and I (1) share a connection with G (1) forming the triangle <1, 8, 2>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 10 inside brackets []: [10].
