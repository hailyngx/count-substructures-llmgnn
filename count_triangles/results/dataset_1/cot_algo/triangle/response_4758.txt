Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most, the new labels for the nodes in the graph are:
Vertex 1 (degree 2) : {1, 5}
Vertex 2 (degree 2) : {2, 7}
Vertex 3 (degree 3) : {3, 8}
Vertex 4 (degree 4) : {0, 4, 6, 9}
Vertex 5 (degree 4) : {5, 8, 7, 3}
Vertex 6 (degree 4) : {1, 7, 9, 2}
Vertex 7 (degree 4) : {2, 6, 8, 9}
Vertex 8 (degree 5) : {8, 5, 4, 7, 0}
Vertex 9 (degree 7) : {9, 4, 3, 6, 0, 7, 5}
Vertex 10 (degree 7) : {8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 9, 3}

Now, let's count the triangles by examining the edges and the shared connections:
Triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
