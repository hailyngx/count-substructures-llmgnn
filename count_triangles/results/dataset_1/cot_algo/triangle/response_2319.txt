Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following order: 

Node 7: 0 connections
Nodes 4 and 6: 1 connection each 
Node 2: 2 connections
Nodes 0, 1, 5: 3 connections each
Nodes 3 and 9: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections

Now, let's count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 2):
   Node 0 (degree 3) has the lower label, so we check its connections {2, 3, 5}. 
   Node 2 is connected to nodes {0}. Shared connection forms triangle <0, 2, 3>.
   
2. Edge (0, 3):
   Node 0 (degree 3) has the lower label, so we check its connections {2, 3, 5}. 
   Node 3 is connected to nodes {0, 9}. Shared connection forms triangle <0, 3, 9>.

3. Edge (0, 5):
   Node 0 (degree 3) has the lower label, so we check its connections {2, 3, 5}. 
   Node 5 is connected to nodes {0, 6}. Shared connection forms triangle <0, 5, 6>.

4. Edge (1, 8):
   Node 1 (degree 3) has the lower label, so we check its connections {8, 9}. 
   Node 8 is connected to nodes {1, 4, 9}. Shared connection forms triangle <1, 8, 4>.

5. Edge (1, 9):
   Node 1 (degree 3) has the lower label, so we check its connections {8, 9}. 
   Node 9 is connected to nodes {1, 3, 8}. Shared connection forms triangle <1, 9, 3>.

6. Edge (3, 9):
   Node 3 (degree 4) has the lower label, so we check its connections {0, 9}. 
   Node 9 is connected to nodes {1, 3, 8}. Shared connection forms triangle <3, 9, 8>.

7. Edge (5, 6):
   Node 5 (degree 3) has the lower label, so we check its connections {0, 6}. 
   Node 6 is connected to nodes {5}. Shared connection forms triangle <5, 6, 0>.

Counting the total number of triangles, we find [7].
