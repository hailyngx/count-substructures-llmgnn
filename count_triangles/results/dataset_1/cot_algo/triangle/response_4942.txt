Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree of connections, we have the following labels for the vertices:
Vertices: 5, 4, 7, 7, 6, 4, 6, 6, 4, 5

Now, we proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 2) forms a triangle with 6: <0, 2, 6>
(0, 6) forms a triangle with 2: <0, 6, 2>
(0, 8) does not form a triangle.
(0, 9) does not form a triangle.
(1, 3) forms a triangle with 9: <1, 3, 9>
(1, 4) does not form a triangle.
(1, 5) does not form a triangle.
(1, 9) does not form a triangle.
(2, 6) forms a triangle with 0: <2, 6, 0>
(2, 7) does not form a triangle.
(2, 9) forms a triangle with 6: <2, 9, 6>
(3, 6) forms a triangle with 0: <3, 6, 0>
(3, 7) does not form a triangle.
(3, 8) forms a triangle with 5: <3, 8, 5>

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 0>, <2, 9, 6>, <3, 6, 0>
