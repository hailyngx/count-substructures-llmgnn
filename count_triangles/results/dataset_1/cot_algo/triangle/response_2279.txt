Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for each vertex are:
(1) - 1 connection
(0) - 3 connections
(4) - 3 connections
(2) - 3 connections
(3) - 3 connections
(5) - 3 connections
(8) - 4 connections
(9) - 4 connections
(7) - 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, specifically for the edges:
(1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 8) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4)

By examining shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles:
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<3, 7, 4>
<5, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
