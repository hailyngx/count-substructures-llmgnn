Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are reordered based on their number of connections:
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections

Based on the ordering above, we will check each edge to find triangles. 

Triangles found:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <1, 8, 4>
5. <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
