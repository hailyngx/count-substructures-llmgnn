Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 5

Considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can list the triangles formed by shared connections:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle <1, 5, 9>
- Triangle <5, 6, 9>
- Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
