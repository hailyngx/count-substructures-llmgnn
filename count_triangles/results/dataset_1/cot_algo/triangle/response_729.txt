Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list each vertex with their number of connections:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 5 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 3 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices from least to most connections:
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 5 connections

Next, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Checking edge (0, 3): No triangle formed
- Checking edge (0, 4): Triangle <0, 4, 9> found
- Checking edge (0, 8): No triangle formed
- Checking edge (1, 2): No triangle formed
- Checking edge (1, 5): No triangle formed
- Checking edge (2, 7): No triangle formed
- Checking edge (3, 4): Triangle <3, 0, 4> found
- Checking edge (4, 6): No triangle formed
- Checking edge (4, 9): No triangle formed
- Checking edge (5, 7): No triangle formed
- Checking edge (6, 9): No triangle formed

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <3, 0, 4>
