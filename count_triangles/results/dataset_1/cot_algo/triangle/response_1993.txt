Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling for the vertices is as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles: 
- <0, 4, 9>
- <0, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
