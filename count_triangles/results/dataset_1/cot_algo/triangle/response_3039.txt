Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have the following labels for the nodes: 
Node 0: 4 connections    
Node 1: 2 connections    
Node 6: 1 connection    
Node 7: 2 connections    
Node 8: 3 connections    
Node 3: 2 connections    
Node 5: 2 connections    
Node 2: 4 connections    
Node 4: 4 connections    
Node 9: 4 connections    

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Examining the edges, we will find the triangles formed: 
For edge (2, 3), node 3 (2 connections) is the lower label, but node 2 (4 connections) has more connections, so we skip this edge.
For edge (2, 4), we find a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
For edge (2, 5), we find a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
For edge (2, 8), we find a triangle <2, 8, 9>.
For edge (3, 9), we find a triangle <3, 9, 7>.
For edge (4, 5), we find a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
For edge (6, 0), none of the nodes have fewer connections.
For edge (7, 0), none of the nodes have fewer connections.
For edge (7, 9), we find a triangle <3, 9, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
