Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 1 is connected to: 0, 2
Vertex 2 is connected to: 1, 3, 7, 9
Vertex 3 is connected to: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
Vertex 4 is connected to: 0, 3, 6, 7
Vertex 5 is connected to: 0, 3, 7
Vertex 6 is connected to: 0, 4
Vertex 7 is connected to: 0, 2, 4, 5
Vertex 8 is connected to: 0, 3
Vertex 9 is connected to: 2, 3

Now, we relabel the vertices according to the number of connections they have:
0 -> 1, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 7, 3 -> 8, 4 -> 6, 5 -> 4, 6 -> 0, 7 -> 5, 8 -> 3, 9 -> 9

Now, analyzing the list of edges provided, we find the triangles that form:
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 1, 2>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 7, 5>, <2, 7, 4>, <3, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
