Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled based on their connections in ascending order:
```
Vertex 4 has 0 connections.
Vertex 3 has 1 connection.
Vertex 7 has 2 connections.
Vertex 2 has 2 connections.
Vertex 5 has 3 connections.
Vertex 0 has 4 connections.
Vertex 1 has 4 connections.
Vertex 6 has 4 connections.
Vertex 9 has 6 connections.
```

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 6): Shared connections with 9 -> Triangle <0, 6, 9>.
2. Edge (0, 9): No triangle.
3. Edge (1, 2): No triangle.
4. Edge (1, 3): No triangle.
5. Edge (1, 6): Shared connections with 9 -> Triangle <1, 6, 9>.
6. Edge (1, 9): No triangle.
7. Edge (2, 1): No triangle.
8. Edge (2, 7): No triangle.
9. Edge (3, 1): No triangle.
10. Edge (4, 9): No triangle.
11. Edge (5, 6): No triangle.
12. Edge (5, 7): No triangle.
13. Edge (5, 9): Shared connections with 6 and 7 -> Triangle <5, 6, 9>.
14. Edge (6, 0): Shared connections with 9 -> Triangle <0, 6, 9>.
15. Edge (6, 1): Shared connections with 9 -> Triangle <1, 6, 9>.
16. Edge (6, 5): Shared connections with 9 -> Triangle <5, 6, 9>.
17. Edge (6, 9): No triangle.
18. Edge (7, 2): No triangle.
19. Edge (7, 5): No triangle.
20. Edge (7, 9): No triangle.
21. Edge (9, 0): Shared connections with 6 -> Triangle <0, 6, 9>.
22. Edge (9, 1): Shared connections with 6 -> Triangle <1, 6, 9>.
23. Edge (9, 4): No triangle.
24. Edge (9, 5): Shared connections with 6 and 7 -> Triangle <5, 6, 9>.
25. Edge (9, 6): No triangle.
26. Edge (9, 7): No triangle.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
