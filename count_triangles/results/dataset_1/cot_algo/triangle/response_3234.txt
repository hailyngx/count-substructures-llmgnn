Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Nodes in increasing order of degree: 8, 7, 0, 3, 8, 1, 4, 5, 9, 6

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Node 8 -> A
Node 7 -> B
Node 0 -> C
Node 3 -> D
Node 8 -> E
Node 1 -> F
Node 4 -> G
Node 5 -> H
Node 9 -> I
Node 6 -> J

Now, we will list the edges considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(A, 5) (A, 7)
(B, 6) (B, 7)
(C, A) (C, F) (C, I)
(D, B) (D, I)
(E, 5) (E, 7)
(F, 7) (F, A)
(G, A) (G, F) (G, I)
(H, B) (H, D)
(I, A) (I, F) (I, G) (I, J)
(J, 6) (J, B) (J, H)

Now, we will count the triangles:
- <A, I, G>
- <A, F, I>
- <A, 5, 7>
- <B, D, I>
- <B, H, J>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
