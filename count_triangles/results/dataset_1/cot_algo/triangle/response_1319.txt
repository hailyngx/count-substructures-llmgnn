Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's re-label the vertices based on their degree:

- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 1 connection
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections

Next, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge: (0, 4) with shared connections: (1, 9)
- Edge: (0, 7) does not meet the criteria
- Edge: (0, 9) with shared connections: (1, 4)
- Edge: (1, 4) with shared connections: (0, 9)
- Edge: (1, 5) with shared connections: (2, 6)
- Edge: (1, 6) with shared connections: (4, 5)
- Edge: (1, 9) with shared connections: (0, 4)
- Edge: (2, 5) does not meet the criteria
- Edge: (2, 8) does not meet the criteria
- Edge: (3, 8) does not meet the criteria
- Edge: (4, 6) with shared connections: (1, 5)
- Edge: (4, 9) with shared connections: (0, 1)
- Edge: (5, 6) with shared connections: (1, 4)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Total number of triangles: [4]
- Unique triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>
