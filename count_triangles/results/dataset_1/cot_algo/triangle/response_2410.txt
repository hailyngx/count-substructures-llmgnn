Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 9: Degree 1
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 0
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 6: Degree 8

Now, we will go through each edge respecting the order of the nodes based on their degrees.

Checking (0, 4): Nodes 0 and 4 share nodes 6, forming triangle <0, 4, 6>.
Checking (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 share nodes 6, forming triangle <0, 5, 6>.
Checking (0, 6): Nodes 0 and 6 share nodes 4, 5, 7, forming triangles <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 6>.
Checking (0, 7): No triangle is formed.
Checking (1, 6): Nodes 1 and 6 share nodes 0, forming triangle <1, 6, 0>.
Checking (1, 9): No triangle is formed.
Checking (2, 5): Nodes 2 and 5 share nodes 0, 6, forming triangle <2, 5, 0>.
Checking (2, 7): Nodes 2 and 7 share node 6, forming triangle <2, 7, 6>.
Checking (3, 6): Nodes 3 and 6 share no triangle.
Checking (4, 6): Nodes 4 and 6 share nodes 0, 5, forming triangle <4, 6, 0>.
Checking (5, 6): Nodes 5 and 6 share nodes 0, 4, forming triangles <5, 6, 0>, <5, 6, 4>.
Checking (9, 1): No triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 6>, <1, 6, 0>, <2, 5, 0>, <2, 7, 6>, <4, 6, 0>, <5, 6, 4>.
