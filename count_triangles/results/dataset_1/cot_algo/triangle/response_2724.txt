Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to create a degree-based ordering of the vertices:

Node 6 is not present in any edges, so we exclude it from our calculations.

Node 0 has degree 2.
Node 1 has degree 1.
Node 2 has degree 2.
Node 3 has degree 3.
Node 4 has degree 2.
Node 5 has degree 3.
Node 7 has degree 1.
Node 8 has degree 3.
Node 9 has degree 2.

Degree-based ordering: (1, 7) < (0, 2, 4, 9) < (3, 5, 8)

Now, we go through the edges in the order specified:

(0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 share a connection with Node 1, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
(1, 2): Node 1 and Node 2 do not form a triangle.
(2, 0): Already counted.
(2, 1): Already counted.
(3, 5): Node 3 and Node 5 share a connection with Node 8, forming a triangle <3, 5, 8>.
(3, 7): Node 3 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.
(3, 8): Already counted.
(4, 9): Node 4 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.
(5, 3): Already counted.
(5, 8): Already counted.
(5, 9): Node 5 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.
(7, 3): Already counted.
(8, 3): Already counted.
(8, 5): Already counted.
(9, 4): Already counted.
(9, 5): Already counted.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <3, 5, 8>
