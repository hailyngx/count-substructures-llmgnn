Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 

Node 3 - Degree: 2  
Node 1 - Degree: 2  
Node 6 - Degree: 2  
Node 8 - Degree: 3  
Node 0 - Degree: 3  
Node 1 - Degree: 3  
Node 7 - Degree: 4  
Node 5 - Degree: 5  
Node 4 - Degree: 6  
Node 9 - Degree: 7  

Now, let's count the triangles:

- For edge (0, 4) with nodes 0 and 4: No triangles formed.
- For edge (0, 9) with nodes 0 and 9: Triangle <0, 2, 9>.
- For edge (1, 5) with nodes 1 and 5: No triangles formed.
- For edge (2, 4) with nodes 2 and 4: Triangle <2, 4, 9>.
- For edge (2, 5) with nodes 2 and 5: Triangle <2, 5, 7>.
- For edge (2, 7) with nodes 2 and 7: No triangles formed.
- For edge (2, 9) with nodes 2 and 9: Triangle <2, 4, 9>.
- For edge (3, 6) with nodes 3 and 6: No triangles formed.
- For edge (3, 8) with nodes 3 and 8: No triangles formed.
- For edge (4, 2) with nodes 2 and 4: Triangle <2, 4, 9>.
- For edge (4, 7) with nodes 4 and 7: No triangles formed.
- For edge (4, 8) with nodes 4 and 8: No triangles formed.
- For edge (4, 9) with nodes 4 and 9: Triangle <0, 2, 9>.
- For edge (5, 1) with nodes 1 and 5: No triangles formed.
- For edge (5, 2) with nodes 2 and 5: Triangle <2, 5, 7>.
- For edge (5, 6) with nodes 5 and 6: No triangles formed.
- For edge (5, 7) with nodes 5 and 7: Triangle <2, 5, 7>.
- For edge (6, 3) with nodes 3 and 6: No triangles formed.
- For edge (6, 5) with nodes 5 and 6: No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 2) with nodes 2 and 7: No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 4) with nodes 4 and 7: No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 5) with nodes 5 and 7: Triangle <2, 5, 7>.
- For edge (8, 3) with nodes 3 and 8: No triangles formed.
- For edge (8, 4) with nodes 4 and 8: No triangles formed.
- For edge (8, 9) with nodes 8 and 9: No triangles formed.
- For edge (9, 0) with nodes 0 and 9: Triangle <0, 2, 9>.
- For edge (9, 2) with nodes 2 and 9: Triangle <2, 4, 9>.
- For edge (9, 4) with nodes 4 and 9: Triangle <0, 2, 9>.
- For edge (9, 5) with nodes 5 and 9: Triangle <2, 5, 7>.
- For edge (9, 8) with nodes 8 and 9: No triangles formed.

The total number of triangles is [6], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 7>.
