Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. The sorted vertices are:

0 (degree 1)
7 (degree 1)
9 (degree 1)
5 (degree 0)
1 (degree 2)
7 (degree 1)
8 (degree 2)
3 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)
2 (degree 4)
  
Now, we will examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(0, 1): Shared connections: None
(1, 4): Shared connections: None
(1, 9): Shared connections: None
(2, 4): Shared connections: None
(2, 6): Shared connections: None
(2, 7): Shared connections: None
(2, 8): Shared connections: None
(3, 4): Shared connections: None
(3, 6): Shared connections: None
(3, 8): Shared connections: None

After examining all edges, we find that there are no triangles in this graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [0].
