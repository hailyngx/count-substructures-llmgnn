Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
- Vertex 3 has degree 1
- Vertices 1, 5, 6, 8 have degree 1
- Vertices 4, 7 have degree 0
- Vertices 0, 2, 9 have degree 3

Now, we can relabel the vertices in increasing order of degree:
- Vertex 3 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 0
- Vertices 1, 5, 6, 8 (Degree 1) -> Vertices 1, 2, 3, 4
- Vertices 4, 7 (Degree 0) -> Vertices 5, 6
- Vertices 0, 2, 9 (Degree 3) -> Vertices 7, 8, 9

Now, let's list the edges based on the new vertex labels:
- (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 9)

Now, we will count the triangles formed using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- (0, 1) shares a connection with (0, 2), forming a triangle with vertex 1
- (0, 2) shares a connection with (0, 9), forming a triangle with vertex 2

So, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2> and <0, 2, 9>.
