Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices with their degrees are as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 6
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 1
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4

Rearranging the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 6 < Node 0, Node 2, Node 7, Node 8  < Node 1, Node 3, Node 9  < Node 5  < Node 4

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles:
<1, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
