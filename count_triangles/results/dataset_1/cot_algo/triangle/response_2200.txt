Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Node 0: degree = 4
- Node 1: degree = 3
- Node 2: degree = 4
- Node 3: degree = 3
- Node 4: degree = 2
- Node 5: degree = 1
- Node 6: degree = 2
- Node 7: degree = 2
- Node 8: degree = 2
- Node 9: degree = 6

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 5 (degree = 1) -> Node 0
- Node 4 (degree = 2) -> Node 1
- Node 6 (degree = 2) -> Node 2
- Node 7 (degree = 2) -> Node 3
- Node 8 (degree = 2) -> Node 4
- Node 1 (degree = 3) -> Node 5
- Node 3 (degree = 3) -> Node 6
- Node 0 (degree = 4) -> Node 7
- Node 2 (degree = 4) -> Node 8
- Node 9 (degree = 6) -> Node 9

After relabeling, the edges are:
(0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7)

Now, we will count the triangles present in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 7, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 7, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 4: <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle 5: <1, 7, 5>
- Triangle 6: <1, 7, 3>
- Triangle 7: <1, 7, 8>
- Triangle 8: <2, 8, 6>
- Triangle 9: <2, 8, 9>
- Triangle 10: <2, 6, 1>
- Triangle 11: <3, 7, 0>
- Triangle 12: <3, 7, 9>
- Triangle 13: <4, 1, 8>
- Triangle 14: <4, 8, 2>
- Triangle 15: <5, 0, 7>
- Triangle 16: <6, 2, 8>
- Triangle 17: <6, 1, 7>
- Triangle 18: <7, 0, 5>
- Triangle 19: <7, 0, 9>
- Triangle 20: <7, 3, 0>
- Triangle 21: <7, 3, 9>
- Triangle 22: <8, 1, 7>
- Triangle 23: <8, 1, 4>
- Triangle 24: <8, 2, 9>
- Triangle 25: <8, 9, 0>
- Triangle 26: <8, 9, 7>
- Triangle 27: <9, 0, 7>
- Triangle 28: <9, 0, 3>
- Triangle 29: <9, 2, 8>
- Triangle 30: <9, 2, 6>
- Triangle 31: <9, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [31].
