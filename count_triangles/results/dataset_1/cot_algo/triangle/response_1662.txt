Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new ordering is: 1, 7, 9, 8, 6, 3, 2, 5, 0, 4.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.
Counting the triangles results in:<9>.
