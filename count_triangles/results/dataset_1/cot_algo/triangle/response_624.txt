Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeled vertices: 

Node 6 has 1 edge(s)
Node 8 has 1 edge(s)
Node 0 has 2 edge(s)
Node 5 has 2 edge(s)
Node 7 has 3 edge(s)
Node 1 has 4 edge(s)
Node 4 has 4 edge(s)
Node 3 has 6 edge(s)
Node 2 has 6 edge(s)
Node 9 has 7 edge(s)
