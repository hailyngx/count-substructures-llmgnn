Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each node has:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 9: 2 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we should first label nodes from least to most connections as follows:
- Node 5 (Label 0)
- Node 8 (Label 1)
- Node 0 (Label 2)
- Node 1 (Label 3)
- Node 2 (Label 4)
- Node 3 (Label 5)
- Node 9 (Label 6)
- Node 4 (Label 7)
- Node 6 (Label 8)
- Node 7 (Label 9)

Next, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Edge (0, 1) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 0 and 1: None

Edge (0, 4) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 0 and 4: None

Edge (1, 0) - Skip (Vertex with lower label doesn't have fewer connections)

Edge (1, 7) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 1 and 7: None

Edge (2, 4) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 2 and 4: None

Edge (2, 5) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 2 and 5: None

Edge (3, 6) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 3 and 6: None

Edge (3, 7) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 3 and 7: None

Edge (4, 0) - Skip (Vertex with lower label doesn't have fewer connections)

Edge (4, 2) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 4 and 2: None

Edge (4, 7) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 4 and 7: None

Edge (4, 9) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 4 and 9: None

Edge (5, 2) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 5 and 2: None

Edge (6, 3) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 6 and 3: None

Edge (6, 7) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 6 and 7: None

Edge (6, 8) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 6 and 8: None

Edge (7, 1) - Skip (Vertex with lower label doesn't have fewer connections)

Edge (7, 3) - Skip (Vertex with lower label doesn't have fewer connections)

Edge (7, 4) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 7 and 4: 0

Edge (7, 6) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 7 and 6: None

Edge (7, 9) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 7 and 9: None

Edge (8, 6) - Proceed
- Shared connections between 8 and 6: None

Edge (9, 4) - Skip (Vertex with lower label doesn't have fewer connections)

Edge (9, 7) - Skip (Vertex with lower label doesn't have fewer connections)

Total number of triangles: [1]

Unique triangles: <0, 4, 7>
