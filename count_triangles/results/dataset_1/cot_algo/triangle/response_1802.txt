Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in this graph.

First, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Now, we relabel the vertices:
Node 0 (1 connection) becomes Node 0
Node 5 (2 connections) becomes Node 1
Node 7 (2 connections) becomes Node 2
Node 4 (2 connections) becomes Node 3
Node 2 (2 connections) becomes Node 4
Node 8 (3 connections) becomes Node 5
Node 6 (3 connections) becomes Node 6
Node 1 (3 connections) becomes Node 7
Node 9 (4 connections) becomes Node 8
Node 3 (5 connections) becomes Node 9

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
- (1, 4) and (1, 3) have a common connection with Node 3. Thus, we have a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
- (2, 3) and (3, 6) have a common connection with Node 3. Thus, we have a triangle <2, 3, 6>.
- (3, 7) and (7, 9) have a common connection with Node 7. Thus, we have a triangle <3, 7, 9>.
- (4, 1) and (1, 3) have a common connection with Node 3. Thus, we have a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
- (8, 4) and (4, 1) have a common connection with Node 4. Thus, we have a triangle <1, 4, 8>.
- (8, 9) and (9, 7) have a common connection with Node 9. Thus, we have a triangle <7, 8, 9>.

The total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
