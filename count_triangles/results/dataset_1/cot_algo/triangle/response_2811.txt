Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order. Here is the sorted list of vertices from least to most connections:
Vertices: 7, 8, 1, 2, 0, 3, 9, 5, 6, 4

Now, we will count the triangles based on the edges provided:
1. Edge (2, 6): No triangles
2. Edge (3, 1): No triangles
3. Edge (4, 3): No triangles
4. Edge (4, 5): No triangles
5. Edge (5, 4): No triangles
6. Edge (6, 2): No triangles
7. Edge (6, 4): Forms a triangle <2, 4, 6>
8. Edge (6, 5): Forms a triangle <4, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <2, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>
