Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Vertex 3 has 2 connections.
Vertex 5 has 2 connections.
Vertex 8 has 2 connections.
Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
Vertex 9 has 4 connections.
Vertex 4 has 4 connections.
Vertex 1 has 4 connections.
Vertex 7 has 5 connections.
Vertex 2 has 5 connections.
Vertex 0 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph: 

[16]

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 0>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 5, 4>
<6, 5, 7>
<7, 9, 2>
<8, 9, 4>
