Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 - Degree 3
Node 1 - Degree 3
Node 2 - Degree 4
Node 3 - Degree 2
Node 4 - Degree 5
Node 5 - Degree 2
Node 6 - Degree 2
Node 7 - Degree 3
Node 8 - Degree 4
Node 9 - Degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering method, we will examine the edges in the following order:
(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 7)

Counting the triangles that form between the vertices gives us the following:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 1>
- <1, 4, 2>
- <1, 7, 3>
- <2, 8, 4>
- <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
