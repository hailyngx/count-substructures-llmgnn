Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order:
Vertex 2 -> 1
Vertex 7 -> 2
Vertex 4 -> 3
Vertex 5 -> 4
Vertex 9 -> 5
Vertex 8 -> 6
Vertex 1 -> 7
Vertex 6 -> 8

Now, we will examine each edge based on the order of the vertices:
(2, 6) - Check connections for vertex 1 and 5: Triangle formed <1, 2, 6>
(4, 6) - Check connections for vertex 3 and 8: No triangle formed
(5, 1) - Check connections for vertex 4 and 7: Triangle formed <4, 1, 5>
(5, 8) - Check connections for vertex 4 and 6: No triangle formed
(6, 2) - Check connections for vertex 8 and 1: No triangle formed
(6, 4) - Check connections for vertex 8 and 3: No triangle formed
(6, 8) - Check connections for vertex 8 and 6: Triangle formed <1, 6, 8>
(6, 9) - Check connections for vertex 8 and 5: No triangle formed
(7, 1) - Check connections for vertex 2 and 7: No triangle formed
(8, 1) - Check connections for vertex 6 and 7: Triangle formed <1, 6, 8>
(8, 5) - Check connections for vertex 6 and 4: Triangle formed <1, 4, 5>
(8, 6) - Check connections for vertex 6 and 8: No triangle formed
(9, 1) - Check connections for vertex 5 and 7: Triangle formed <1, 5, 9>
(9, 6) - Check connections for vertex 5 and 8: No triangle formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 8>.
