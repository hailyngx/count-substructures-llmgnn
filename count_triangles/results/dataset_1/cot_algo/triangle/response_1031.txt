Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following labels:
- Vertex 0 with degree 2
- Vertex 4 with degree 1
- Vertex 5 with degree 2
- Vertex 7 with degree 2
- Vertex 8 with degree 3
- Vertex 9 with degree 3
- Vertex 3 with degree 4
- Vertex 1 with degree 4
- Vertex 2 with degree 4
- Vertex 6 with degree 4

Counting the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Triangle <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle <2, 1, 6>
- Triangle <2, 1, 8>
- Triangle <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle <3, 6, 1>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <6, 9, 1>
- Triangle <6, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
