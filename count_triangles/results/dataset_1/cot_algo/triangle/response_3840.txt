Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices and their connections in descending order of their degrees:

- Vertex 4: 5 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 1 connection
- Vertex 7: 1 connection

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles by checking shared connections for each edge. 

After analyzing the graph, we can find the following triangles: 

<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 4>
<3, 2, 4>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 6, 2>
<6, 2, 4>

Counting the unique triangles, we find that there are a total of 7 triangles in this graph. 

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [7].
