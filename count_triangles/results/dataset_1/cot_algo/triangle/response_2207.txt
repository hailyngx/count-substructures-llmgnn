Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The triangles in the given graph are:
