Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertices with their degrees in brackets:  
0(4), 1(0), 2(4), 3(2), 4(4), 5(4), 6(2), 7(4), 8(2), 9(4).

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we proceed as follows:
- Edge (0, 3) forms triangle <0, 3, 9>.
- Edge (0, 5) forms triangle <0, 5, 2>.
- Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 9) forms triangle <0, 9, 6>.
- Edge (2, 4) forms triangle <2, 4, 5>.
- Edge (2, 5) forms triangle <2, 5, 4>.
- Edge (2, 7) forms triangle <2, 7, 4>.
- Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 9, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 7, 4>.
