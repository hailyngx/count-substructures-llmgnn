Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 7 - 1 connection  
Vertex 9 - 2 connections  
Vertex 0 - 2 connections  
Vertex 1 - 3 connections  
Vertex 5 - 3 connections  
Vertex 6 - 4 connections  
Vertex 4 - 4 connections  
Vertex 8 - 5 connections  
Vertex 2 - 5 connections  
Vertex 3 - 5 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles:

1. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <3, 4, 2>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
