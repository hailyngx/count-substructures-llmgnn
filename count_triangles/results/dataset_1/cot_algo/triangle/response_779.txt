Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices in this graph is as follows:  
Vertex 1: 2 connections  
Vertex 4: 2 connections  
Vertex 2: 2 connections  
Vertex 5: 2 connections  
Vertex 3: 3 connections  
Vertex 6: 4 connections  
Vertex 0: 4 connections  
Vertex 7: 5 connections  
Vertex 8: 6 connections  
Vertex 9: 6 connections  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge in the order specified and count the number of triangles:

Considering edge (0, 6): No triangles formed.
Considering edge (0, 7): Triangle found: <0, 7, 3>.
Considering edge (0, 8): Triangle found: <0, 8, 6>.
Considering edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
Considering edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
Considering edge (3, 7): No triangles formed.
Considering edge (3, 8): Triangle found: <3, 8, 0>.
Considering edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
Considering edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.
Considering edge (5, 9): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <0, 7, 3>, <0, 8, 6>, <3, 8, 0>.
