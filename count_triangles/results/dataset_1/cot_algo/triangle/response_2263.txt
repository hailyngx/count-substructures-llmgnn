Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently in the given graph. 

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connections, the new vertex order is: 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 7, 0, 3, 5, 9.

Now, following the rule to only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Triangle <0, 1, 9> is formed by the shared connection through vertex 9.
- Triangle <3, 5, 9> is formed by the shared connection through vertex 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
