Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections. In this case, the sorted order is as follows:

Node 6: 1 connection
Node 0, 1, 2, 4: 2 connections
Node 5, 7: 3 connections
Node 8, 9: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Next, we will count the triangles in the graph by checking each edge in the order of the sorted vertices.

Starting with Node 6, we skip it as it has only 1 connection.

Moving to Node 0, we check its edges with nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8. 
- Edge (0, 2) and edge (2, 0) form a triangle with Node 2 shared. 
- Edge (0, 3) and edge (3, 0) form a triangle with Node 3 shared. 
- No triangle with Node 5. 
- Edge (0, 8) and edge (8, 0) form a triangle with Node 8 shared. 

Moving to Node 1, we check its edges with nodes 3, 7, and 9. 
- Edge (1, 3) and edge (3, 1) form a triangle with Node 3 shared. 
- No triangles with nodes 7 and 9.

Moving to Node 2, we skip it since we already considered its edges.

Moving to Node 4, we check its edges with nodes 7, 8, and 9. 
- Edge (4, 7) and edge (7, 4) form a triangle with Node 7 shared. 
- Edge (4, 8) and edge (8, 4) form a triangle with Node 8 shared. 
- No triangles with Node 9.

Moving to Node 5, we skip it since we already considered its edges.

Moving to Node 7, we skip it since we already considered its edges.

Moving to Node 8, we check its edges with nodes 3 and 4. 
- Edge (8, 3) and edge (3, 8) form a triangle with Node 3 shared. 
- No triangle with Node 4.

Finally, moving to Node 9, we check its edges with nodes 3 and 7. 
- Edge (9, 3) and edge (3, 9) form a triangle with Node 3 shared. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <3, 9, 7>.
