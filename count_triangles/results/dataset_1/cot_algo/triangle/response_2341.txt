Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and then relabeling them accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is: 3, 6, 2, 5, 9, 7, 4, 1, 8, 0.

Reordering the vertices in the edge list based on their new labels gives:
(3, 4) (3, 7) (2, 1) (5, 1) (6, 1) (2, 8) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (2, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (4, 0) (5, 1) (9, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (9, 6) (7, 0) (1, 8) (0, 8) (1, 9) (4, 0) (1, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 8) (0, 4) (8, 7) (1, 5)

Counting the unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 5, 8>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
