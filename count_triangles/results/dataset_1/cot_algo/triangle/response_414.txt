Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows: 

Node 7 : 1 connection
Node 3 : 1 connection
Node 9 : 1 connection
Node 8 : 1 connection
Node 4 : 2 connections
Node 6 : 2 connections
Node 2 : 3 connections
Node 1 : 4 connections
Node 5 : 4 connections
Node 0 : 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles by examining the edges. 

After checking the edges, we find that there are 2 triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 2: <1, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [2].
