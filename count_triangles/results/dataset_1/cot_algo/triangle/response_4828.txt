Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have the following ordering:
Vertices: 9, 0, 1, 6, 8, 3, 7, 4, 5, 2

Now, we will count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering:
1. Edge (0, 1): Both vertices have only 2 connections, forming a triangle with vertex 5. Triangle <0, 1, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 2): Vertex 0 has 2 connections, vertex 2 has 4 connections. Common connections: 5. Triangle <0, 2, 5>.
3. Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, vertex 5 has 4 connections. Common connections: 0, 2. Triangles <1, 5, 0>, <1, 5, 2>.
4. Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 has 4 connections, vertex 4 has 4 connections. Common connections: 5. Triangle <2, 4, 5>.
5. Edge (4, 6): Both vertices have 3 connections, forming a triangle with vertex 5. Triangle <4, 6, 5>.
6. Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5 has 4 connections, vertex 8 has 2 connections. Common connections: 2. Triangle <5, 8, 2>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 0>, <1, 5, 2>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 5>.
