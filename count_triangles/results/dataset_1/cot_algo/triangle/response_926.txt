Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following labels for the vertices:  

Vertex 0 : 4 connections  
Vertex 1 : 1 connection  
Vertex 2 : 2 connections  
Vertex 3 : 4 connections  
Vertex 4 : 4 connections  
Vertex 5 : 4 connections  
Vertex 6 : 2 connections  
Vertex 7 : 1 connection  
Vertex 8 : 2 connections  
Vertex 9 : 3 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through the edges and count the triangles formed:

Considering edges with lower labeled vertices initiating the check:
1. (0, 1): No triangles are formed.
2. (2, 4): No triangles are formed.
3. (2, 6): No triangles are formed.
4. (3, 4): Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>.
5. (3, 5): No triangles are formed.
6. (3, 6): No triangles are formed.
7. (5, 4): Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>.
8. (6, 3): No triangles are formed.
9. (8, 9): No triangles are formed.
10. (9, 8): No triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <3, 4, 5>.
