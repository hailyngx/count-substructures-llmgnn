Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 3 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 7 and 1 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 0, 6, and 7 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 4 and 8 have 4 connections each.
- Node 5 has 5 connections.
- Node 2 has 5 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
- <5, 8, 9>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
