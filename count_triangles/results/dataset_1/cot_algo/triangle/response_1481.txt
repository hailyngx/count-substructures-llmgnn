Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most, the new numbering will be as follows:
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 5
Node 1 has degree 6
Node 3 has degree 6
Node 4 has degree 7

Using this new numbering, we can now find the triangles:

Triangles:
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 6>

[Total number of triangles: 4]
