Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes sorted by their number of connections are: 1(2), 8(2), 7(2), 9(3), 3(3), 6(3), 4(4), 1(4), 5(4), 0(7).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the graph are as follows: [13]
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>.
