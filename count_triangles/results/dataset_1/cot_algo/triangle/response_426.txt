Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 6 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph.

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
