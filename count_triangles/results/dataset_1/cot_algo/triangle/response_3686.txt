Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on the number of connections are:
\[0 (degree: 1), 5 (degree: 1), 7 (degree: 2), 1 (degree: 3), 3 (degree: 3), 5 (degree: 3), 2 (degree: 4), 4 (degree: 4), 8 (degree: 4), 9 (degree: 5)\]

The triangles formed in this graph are:
<0, 1, 5>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

So the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
