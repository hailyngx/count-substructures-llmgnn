Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

0: 3 connections
1: 2 connections
7: 1 connection
8: 2 connections
2: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
9: 6 connections
5: 7 connections
3: 7 connections

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Checking each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
<2, 3, 0>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<8, 5, 6>
<8, 5, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12]. The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 0>, <1, 4, 5>, <8, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, and <0, 3, 9>.
