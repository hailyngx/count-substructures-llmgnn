Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Number of connections for each vertex:
0: 2
1: 2
2: 3
3: 4
6: 4
7: 2
8: 2
9: 2

Therefore, the ordering of the vertices from least to most connected is: 0, 1, 7, 8, 9, 6, 2, 3.

Next, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 (0), 1 (1), 7 (2), 8 (3), 9 (4), 6 (5), 2 (6), 3 (7).

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:
- Edge (0, 1): Both have 2 connections, no triangles.
- Edge (0, 2): Node 0 has 2 connections, no triangles.
- Edge (1, 6): Both have 2 connections, no triangles.
- Edge (2, 6): Both have 3 connections, no triangles.
- Edge (2, 9): Node 2 has 3 connections, no triangles.
- Edge (3, 6): Node 6 has 4 connections, forms triangle <3, 6, 2>.
- Edge (3, 7): Node 7 has 2 connections, no triangles.
- Edge (3, 8): Node 8 has 2 connections, no triangles.
- Edge (3, 9): Node 9 has 2 connections, no triangles.

So, the total number of triangles is [1]. The unique triangle found is <3, 6, 2>.
