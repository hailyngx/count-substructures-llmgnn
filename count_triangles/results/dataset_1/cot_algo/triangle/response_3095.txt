Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled based on their number of connections:
- Node 0 with 3 connections
- Node 1 with 2 connections
- Node 2 with 4 connections
- Node 3 with 1 connection
- Node 4 with 2 connections
- Node 5 with 2 connections
- Node 6 with 3 connections
- Node 7 with 6 connections
- Node 8 with 2 connections
- Node 9 with 3 connections

Examining the edges, we find that we can count the following triangles:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [7].
