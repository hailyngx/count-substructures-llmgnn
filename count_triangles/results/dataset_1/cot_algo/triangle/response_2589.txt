Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on the number of connections (degree):
Vertices in order: 3, 9, 10 (degree: 0) <1, 2, 7> (degree: 1) <4, 6, 8> (degree: 2) <5> (degree: 3)

Now, we check each edge with the lower labeled vertex having the fewer connections:
- Edge (1, 4): Both vertices have degree 2 and the shared connection is vertex 8. Therefore, there is a triangle <1, 4, 8>.
- Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has degree 2 and vertex 8 has degree 2. The shared connection is vertex 4, forming a triangle <1, 8, 4>.
- Edge (2, 6): Both vertices have degree 1, but there are no shared connections, so no triangle.
- Edge (4, 1): Already counted in the triangle <1, 4, 8>.
- Edge (4, 5): Both vertices have degree 2 and the shared connection is vertex 8. Therefore, there is a triangle <4, 5, 8>.
- Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5 has degree 3, and vertex 8 has degree 2. The shared connection is vertex 4, forming a triangle <5, 8, 4>.
- Edge (6, 2): Already counted in the triangle <1, 8, 4>.
- Edge (6, 7): Both vertices have degree 1, but there are no shared connections, so no triangle.
- Edge (8, 1): Already counted in the triangle <1, 8, 4>.
- Edge (8, 5): Already counted in the triangle <4, 5, 8>.

Now, we count the total number of triangles: 3
Unique triangles found: <1, 4, 8>, <1, 8, 4>, <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
