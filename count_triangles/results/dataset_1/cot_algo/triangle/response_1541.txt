Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. 
The sorted list is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 8, 4, 9, 6  

Now, we will count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between the vertices of each edge:

Starting with edge (1, 5):
Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 5, so we check shared connections of vertex 1 and 5: Vertex 1: {5}, Vertex 5: {1, 6}
There is one triangle <1, 5, 6>

Moving on to edge (2, 9):  
Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 9, so we check shared connections of vertex 2 and 9: Vertex 2: {}, Vertex 9: {3, 6, 7, 8}

Continuing with the other edges following the same method, we get the following triangles:
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 9, 6>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
