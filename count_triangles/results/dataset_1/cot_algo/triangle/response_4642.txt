Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. Then we relabel the vertices accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is: 
0 - degree 2
1 - degree 4
9 - degree 4
7 - degree 4
4 - degree 4
5 - degree 4
6 - degree 4
2 - degree 5
8 - degree 5
3 - degree 6

Now, let's check for triangles:

Triangles:
1. <2, 3, 8>
2. <3, 4, 6>
3. <3, 4, 9>
4. <3, 5, 7>
5. <3, 5, 8>
6. <3, 6, 7>
7. <3, 7, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 7]
