Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
```
Node 1: 1 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 5: 7 connections
```

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 2) forms triangle with node 5: <0, 2, 5>
2. Edge (0, 3) does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (0, 4) forms triangle with node 5: <0, 4, 5>
4. Edge (0, 5) forms triangle with nodes 2 and 4: <0, 2, 5> and <0, 4, 5>
5. Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle, as node 1 has the lowest label.
7. Edge (2, 5) forms triangle with nodes 0 and 4: <0, 2, 5> and <0, 4, 5>
8. Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (3, 4) forms triangle with nodes 0 and 5: <0, 3, 4>
11. Edge (3, 5) forms triangle with nodes 0 and 4: <0, 3, 5>
12. Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.
13. Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle, as node 5 has the highest label.
14. Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
15. Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
16. Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
17. Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 3, 4>, and <0, 3, 5>.
