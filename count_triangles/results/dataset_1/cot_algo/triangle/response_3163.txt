Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Starting with the edges and the vertices with the lower labels having fewer connections:
1. (0, 2): No triangles
2. (1, 6): No triangles
3. (2, 3): Triangle formed <2, 3, 4>
4. (2, 0): No triangles
5. (2, 3): No triangles
6. (3, 2): No triangles
7. (3, 4): Triangle formed <2, 3, 4>
8. (3, 9): No triangles
9. (4, 3): No triangles
10. (4, 5): No triangles
11. (4, 8): Triangle formed <3, 4, 5>
12. (5, 4): No triangles
13. (5, 8): Triangle formed <3, 4, 5>
14. (5, 9): No triangles
15. (6, 1): No triangles
16. (6, 7): No triangles
17. (7, 6): No triangles
18. (8, 4): Triangle formed <3, 4, 5>
19. (8, 5): No triangles
20. (9, 3): No triangles
21. (9, 5): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 5>
