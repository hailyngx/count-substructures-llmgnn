Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is: 

Node 2: Degree 1  
Nodes 3, 6, 8: Degree 2  
Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5: Degree 3  
Nodes 7, 9: Degree 4  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we process the edges as follows:

1. **Edge (0, 1)**: Both nodes have degree 3, so we proceed.  
   - Shared connections: None  

2. **Edge (0, 7)**: Nodes 0 and 7 have degrees 3 and 4 respectively.  
   - Shared connections: None  

3. **Edge (0, 8)**: Node 0 has degree 3, so we proceed.  
   - Shared connections: None  

4. **Edge (1, 4)**: Nodes 1 and 4 have degrees 3, so we proceed.  
   - Shared connections: None  

5. **Edge (1, 5)**: Nodes 1 and 5 have degrees 3, so we proceed.  
   - Shared connections: None  

6. **Edge (3, 5)**: Nodes 3 and 5 have degrees 2 and 3 respectively.  
   - Shared connections: None  

7. **Edge (3, 6)**: Nodes 3 and 6 have degrees 2, so we proceed.  
   - Shared connections: None  

8. **Edge (4, 7)**: Nodes 4 and 7 have degrees 3 and 4 respectively.  
   - Shared connections: None  

9. **Edge (5, 9)**: Nodes 5 and 9 have degrees 3 and 4 respectively.  
   - Shared connections: None  

10. **Edge (7, 9)**: Nodes 7 and 9 have degrees 4, so we proceed.  
    - Shared connections: None  

Based on the analysis above, the total number of triangles is [0]. 

The unique triangles found are:  
- <0, 1, 4>  
- <3, 5, 9>
