Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the relabeled graph and edges are as follows:

Vertices: 2, 6, 0, 8, 3, 1, 9, 7, 5, 4

Edges: (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

[Total number of triangles: 5]
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 4>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
