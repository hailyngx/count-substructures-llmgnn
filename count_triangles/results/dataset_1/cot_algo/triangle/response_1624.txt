Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted list of vertices is: 

Node 3: degree 2
Node 0: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 6: degree 7

Now, we'll traverse the edges based on the vertices' labels in increasing order. We'll count the number of triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 9, 6>
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 1>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 5>
<3, 1, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 6>
<5, 2, 6>
<6, 1, 4>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 2, 1>
<6, 2, 4>
<6, 2, 5>
<6, 3, 1>
<6, 4, 5>
<6, 4, 7>
<6, 5, 2>
<6, 5, 4>
<6, 5, 7>
<6, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 7, 5>
<6, 8, 4>
<6, 9, 0>
<6, 9, 1>
<6, 9, 7>

Total number of triangles: [34]
