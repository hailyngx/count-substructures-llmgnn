Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their connections from least to most, the relabeled graph will be as follows: 

Vertices: 3, 7, 0, 4, 6, 8, 9, 2, 5, 1

The edges that we will process based on the Degree-Based Ordering method are: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (4, 5), (5, 8), (6, 9)

There are 7 triangles in the graph:
[7] 

The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 6, 9>.
