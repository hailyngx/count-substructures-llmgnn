Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes by their degree:

Node 3: degree 0
Node 7: degree 1
Node 9: degree 1
Node 0: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6
Node 1: degree 7

Now, we go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

For the edge (0, 1):
Node 0 (degree 2) is lower labeled, and they share Node 6. So, triangle <0, 1, 6> is formed.

For the edge (0, 6):
Node 0 is lower labeled, and they don't share any common neighbor. No triangle is formed.

For the edge (1, 2):
Node 1 (degree 7) is lower labeled, and they share Nodes 4 and 5. So, triangles <1, 2, 4> and <1, 2, 5> are formed.

Continue this process for all edges, ensuring the lower labeled node's degree is smaller:

Total triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 5>
