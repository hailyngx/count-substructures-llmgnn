Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections. In this case, the sorted vertices are: 

Vertices with degrees:
0: 2
5: 2
6: 2
3: 2
4: 3
9: 4
7: 4
1: 5
2: 5
8: 5

Now, we can count the triangles:

- Triangle <4, 7, 1>
- Triangle <4, 9, 8>
- Triangle <1, 7, 3>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
