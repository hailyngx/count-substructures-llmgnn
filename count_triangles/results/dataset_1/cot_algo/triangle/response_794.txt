Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
- Node 2 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 3, 4, and 5 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 7 and 8 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 1 and 9 have 4 connections each.
- Node 0 has 5 connections.
- Node 6 has 6 connections.

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on the sorted order:
- Node 2 (label 0)
- Nodes 3, 4, 5 (label 1, 2, 3)
- Nodes 7, 8 (label 4, 5)
- Nodes 1, 9 (label 6, 7)
- Node 0 (label 8)
- Node 6 (label 9)

Now, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will count the triangles formed by shared connections:
- Triangle 1: <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle 2: <1, 6, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
