Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degree of connection in ascending order, the vertices are as follows:
0 - degree: 1
2 - degree: 1
3 - degree: 1
6 - degree: 1
9 - degree: 1
7 - degree: 2
1 - degree: 3
5 - degree: 7
8 - degree: 7
4 - degree: 8

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider each edge starting from vertices with lower labels and fewer connections. 

By following the method and counting the triangles formed by shared connections, we find the following unique triangles: 
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [2].
