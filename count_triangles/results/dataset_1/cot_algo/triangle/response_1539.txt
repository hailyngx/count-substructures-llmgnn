Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabeling them accordingly, the new ordering of the vertices becomes: 

Node 9 - 1 connection
Node 0 - 2 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 3 - 4 connections
Node 4 - 4 connections
Node 7 - 4 connections
Node 5 - 5 connections
Node 6 - 5 connections
Node 2 - 6 connections
Node 8 - 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, the triangles can be counted as follows: 

Triangles: [<0, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
