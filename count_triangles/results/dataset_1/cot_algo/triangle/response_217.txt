Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabelling them, the new ordering of the nodes is: 2, 1, 7, 9, 6, 8, 3, 4, 5, 0.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 6>
