Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new vertex labels will be: 

Vertex 2 - Degree 1
Vertex 4 - Degree 1
Vertex 9 - Degree 1
Vertex 1 - Degree 2
Vertex 3 - Degree 2
Vertex 4 - Degree 2
Vertex 7 - Degree 4
Vertex 8 - Degree 4
Vertex 6 - Degree 5
Vertex 0 - Degree 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will count the triangles. 

Triangles:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [4]
