Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the nodes based on their degrees, we get the following relabeling: 

Nodes sorted by degree (lowest to highest): 1, 9, 0, 8, 5, 7, 4, 3, 6, 2

After relabeling, the edges become: (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the shared connections between the vertices of each edge:

Total number of triangles: [18]

Unique triangles found:
