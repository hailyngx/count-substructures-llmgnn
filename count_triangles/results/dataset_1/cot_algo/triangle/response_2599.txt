Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Starting with the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertex 4 has 3 connections.
Vertex 2 has 3 connections.
Vertex 6 has 2 connections.
Vertex 8 has 2 connections.
Vertex 9 has 2 connections.
Vertex 5 has 3 connections.
Vertex 7 has 4 connections.
Vertex 1 has 4 connections.
Vertex 3 has 4 connections.
Vertex 0 has 6 connections.

Relabeling the vertices accordingly:

0 -> 0
1 -> 1
2 -> 2
3 -> 3
4 -> 4
5 -> 5
6 -> 6
7 -> 7
8 -> 8
9 -> 9

Now, we check each edge to count the triangles:

(0, 1) forms triangles with: <0, 3, 1>; <0, 7, 1>; <0, 1, 5>.
(0, 3) forms triangles with: <0, 1, 3>; <0, 7, 3>; <0, 3, 2>; <0, 3, 7>; <0, 5, 3>.
(0, 5) forms triangles with: <0, 1, 5>; <0, 5, 8>.
(0, 6) does not form any triangles.
(0, 7) forms triangles with: <0, 1, 7>; <0, 7, 4>; <0, 7, 3>.
(1, 2) forms a triangle with: <1, 3, 2>.
(1, 3) forms triangles with: <1, 3, 2>; <1, 7, 3>; <1, 4, 3>.
(1, 7) forms triangles with: <1, 3, 7>; <1, 4, 7>; <1, 7, 5>; <1, 7, 0>.
(2, 3) forms a triangle with: <2, 6, 3>.
(2, 6) does not form any triangles.
(3, 7) forms triangles with: <3, 1, 7>; <3, 2, 7>; <3, 4, 7>; <3, 7, 0>.
(4, 5) forms a triangle with: <4, 0, 5>.
(4, 7) forms triangles with: <4, 0, 7>; <4, 7, 1>; <4, 7, 5>; <4, 9, 7>.
(4, 9) does not form any triangles.
(5, 8) does not form any triangles.
(6, 2) does not form any triangles.
(7, 0) forms triangles with: <7, 1, 0>; <7, 3, 0>; <7, 4, 0>; <7, 0, 5>.
(8, 5) does not form any triangles.
(8, 9) does not form any triangles.
(9, 8) does not form any triangles.

Total number of triangles: [17]
