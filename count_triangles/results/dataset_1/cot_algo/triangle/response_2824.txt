Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 0 - 5 edges
Node 1 - 2 edges
Node 2 - 3 edges
Node 3 - 2 edges
Node 4 - 4 edges
Node 5 - 2 edges
Node 6 - 3 edges
Node 7 - 3 edges
Node 8 - 1 edge
Node 9 - 4 edges

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <0, 6, 5>
2. Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <0, 7, 4>
3. Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (2, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <2, 7, 0>
8. Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <4, 7, 0>
11. Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
12. Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 6, 5>, <0, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 0>.
