Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new ordering is: 7, 6, 2, 1, 3, 5, 0, 4, 8, 9.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles and list them:

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 8, 9>
