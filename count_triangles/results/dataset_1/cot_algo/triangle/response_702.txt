Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  
Vertex 6 has 1 connection.  
Vertex 4 has 1 connection.  
Vertices 1 and 9 have 1 connection each.  
Vertices 3 and 6 have 2 connections each.  
Vertices 2 and 4 have 3 connections each.  
Vertices 5 and 8 have the most connections with 4 connections each.  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges as follows:  
Edge (0, 2) -> Both vertices have 4 connections, skip.  
Edge (0, 5) -> Vertex 0 has 4 connections and Vertex 5 has 4 connections.  
Edge (0, 7) -> Vertex 0 has 4 connections and Vertex 7 has 4 connections.  
Edge (0, 8) -> Vertex 0 has 4 connections and Vertex 8 has 4 connections.  
Edge (1, 8) -> Vertex 1 has 1 connection, skip.  
Edge (2, 5) -> Vertex 2 has 3 connections, skip.  
Edge (3, 8) -> Vertex 3 has 2 connections, skip.  
Edge (3, 9) -> Vertices 3 and 9 have 2 connections each.  
Edge (4, 5) -> Vertex 4 has 1 connection, skip.  
Edge (5, 7) -> Vertex 5 has 4 connections and Vertex 7 has 4 connections.  
Edge (6, 7) -> Vertex 6 has 1 connection, skip.  
Edge (7, 8) -> Vertex 7 has 4 connections and Vertex 8 has 4 connections.  
Edge (8, 1) -> Vertex 8 has 4 connections, skip.  

There are 3 triangles in the graph:  
1. <0, 5, 7>  
2. <3, 7, 9>  
3. <7, 0, 8>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
