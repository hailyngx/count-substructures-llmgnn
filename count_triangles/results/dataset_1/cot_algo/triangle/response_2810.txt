Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections), we have the following new labels for the nodes:
- Node 1: 1 connections
- Node 5: 1 connections
- Node 7: 1 connections
- Node 9: 1 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 6: 6 connections

Now, we will check each edge in the graph to find the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2): Both nodes 0 and 2 have 3 and 4 connections respectively. So, we proceed with node 0.
2. Edge (0, 8): Node 0 has 3 connections and node 8 has 4 connections. So, we skip this edge.
3. Edge (1, 4): Both nodes 1 and 4 have 1 and 2 connections respectively. So, we proceed with node 1.
4. Edge (2, 6): Both nodes 2 and 6 have 4 and 6 connections respectively. So, we proceed with node 2.
5. Edge (2, 9): Node 2 has 4 connections and node 9 has 1 connection. So, we proceed with node 9.
6. Edge (3, 6): Both nodes 3 and 6 have 3 and 6 connections respectively. So, we proceed with node 3.
7. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 has 3 connections and node 8 has 4 connections. So, we skip this edge.
8. Edge (4, 6): Node 4 has 2 connections and node 6 has 6 connections. So, we proceed with node 4.
9. Edge (5, 6): Both nodes 5 and 6 have 1 and 6 connections respectively. So, we proceed with node 5.
10. Edge (6, 8): Node 6 has 6 connections and node 8 has 4 connections. So, we skip this edge.
11. Edge (6, 3): Node 6 has 6 connections and node 3 has 3 connections. We find a triangle <3, 6, 4>.
12. Edge (6, 4): Node 6 has 6 connections and node 4 has 2 connections. We find a triangle <4, 6, 0>.
13. Edge (6, 5): Node 6 has 6 connections and node 5 has 1 connection. So, we skip this edge.
14. Edge (6, 8): Node 6 has 6 connections and node 8 has 4 connections. So, we skip this edge.
15. Edge (6, 8): Node 6 has 6 connections and node 8 has 4 connections. So, we skip this edge.
16. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 has 6 connections and node 7 has 1 connection. So, we skip this edge.
17. Edge (8, 0): Node 8 has 4 connections and node 0 has 3 connections. So, we proceed with node 0.
18. Edge (8, 3): Node 8 has 4 connections and node 3 has 3 connections. We find a triangle <3, 8, 0>.
19. Edge (8, 6): Node 8 has 4 connections and node 6 has 6 connections. So, we proceed with node 8.
20. Edge (8, 7): Node 8 has 4 connections and node 7 has 1 connection. So, we skip this edge.
21. Edge (9, 2): Node 9 has 1 connection and node 2 has 4 connections. So, we proceed with node 9.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is 2, and they are <3, 6, 4> and <4, 6, 0>. 

Therefore, the final output is [2].
