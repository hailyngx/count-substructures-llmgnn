Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree:
Node 3: degree 1
Node 5: degree 1
Node 1: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 2: degree 6
Node 7: degree 6

Reordering the vertices:
Node 3 -> Node 0
Node 5 -> Node 1
Node 1 -> Node 2
Node 5 -> Node 3
Node 0 -> Node 4
Node 4 -> Node 5
Node 8 -> Node 6
Node 9 -> Node 7
Node 2 -> Node 8
Node 7 -> Node 9
