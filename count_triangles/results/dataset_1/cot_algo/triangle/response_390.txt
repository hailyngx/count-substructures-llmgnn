Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 3 has 2 connections.
Vertex 4 has 2 connections.
Vertex 7 has 2 connections.
Vertex 0 has 2 connections.
Vertex 2 has 3 connections.
Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
Vertex 1 has 5 connections.
Vertex 5 has 5 connections.
Vertex 8 has 5 connections.
Vertex 9 has 6 connections.

We will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 3 -> 0
Vertex 4 -> 1
Vertex 7 -> 2
Vertex 0 -> 3
Vertex 2 -> 4
Vertex 6 -> 5
Vertex 1 -> 6
Vertex 5 -> 7
Vertex 8 -> 8
Vertex 9 -> 9

Next, we will analyze the edges in the graph based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge: (0, 8)
   Both vertices have the same degree, so proceed with lower labeled vertex.
   Check shared connections of 0 and 8: 9
   Triangle: <0, 8, 9>

2. Edge: (0, 9)
   Vertex 0 has fewer connections than 9, so proceed.
   Check shared connections of 0 and 9: 8
   Triangle: <0, 8, 9>

3. Edge: (1, 2)
   Vertex 1 has fewer connections than 2, so proceed.
   Check shared connections of 1 and 2: No triangle formed.

4. Edge: (1, 4)
   Vertex 1 has fewer connections than 4, so proceed.
   Check shared connections of 1 and 4: 5
   Triangle: <1, 4, 5>

5. Edge: (1, 8)
   Vertex 1 has fewer connections than 8, so proceed.
   Check shared connections of 1 and 8: 9
   Triangle: <1, 8, 9>

6. Edge: (1, 9)
   Vertex 1 has fewer connections than 9, so proceed.
   Check shared connections of 1 and 9: 8
   Triangle: <1, 8, 9>

7. Edge: (2, 1)
   Both vertices have the same degree, so proceed with lower labeled vertex.
   Check shared connections of 2 and 1: No triangle formed.

8. Edge: (2, 9)
   Vertex 2 has fewer connections than 9, so proceed.
   Check shared connections of 2 and 9: No triangle formed.

9. Remaining edges do not result in forming any triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
