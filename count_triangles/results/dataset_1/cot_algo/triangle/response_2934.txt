Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 1
Node 4 has degree 6
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 4

Relabeling the nodes:
Node 3 -> 0
Node 1 -> 1
Node 2 -> 2
Node 6 -> 3
Node 0 -> 4
Node 5 -> 5
Node 7 -> 6
Node 8 -> 7
Node 9 -> 8
Node 4 -> 9

Edges to consider (lower labeled vertex comes first):
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 3), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (9, 2), (9, 5), (9, 7)
