Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabelling them accordingly, the new order is as follows:
Node 5 (Degree 1)
Node 1 (Degree 1)
Node 0 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 2)
Node 9 (Degree 3)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 7 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 5)
Node 3 (Degree 5)
Node 2 (Degree 6)

Now, we will go through the edges based on the relabelling. 
Analyzing the edges, we can find the triangles as follows:
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <3, 7, 8>

After counting all the triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
