Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  

Node 4: degree 1  
Node 6: degree 2  
Node 5: degree 3  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 5  
Node 8: degree 5  
Node 0: degree 6  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  
By checking the shared connections, we can count the total number of triangles.  

The total number of triangles is [5].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 8>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<1, 2, 8>  
<1, 8, 9>  
<3, 7, 9>
