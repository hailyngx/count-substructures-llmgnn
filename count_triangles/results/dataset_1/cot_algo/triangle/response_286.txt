Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
   - Vertex 7: 0 connections
   - Vertex 2: 0 connections
   - Vertex 8: 1 connection
   - Vertex 3: 1 connection
   - Vertex 0: 3 connections
   - Vertex 1: 3 connections
   - Vertex 9: 3 connections
   - Vertex 5: 4 connections
   - Vertex 4: 5 connections
   - Vertex 6: 5 connections

2. Relabel the vertices based on the sorted order:
   - Vertex 7 (0 connections) becomes Vertex 0
   - Vertex 2 (0 connections) becomes Vertex 1
   - Vertex 8 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 2
   - Vertex 3 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 3
   - Vertex 0 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 4
   - Vertex 1 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 5
   - Vertex 9 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 6
   - Vertex 5 (4 connections) becomes Vertex 7
   - Vertex 4 (5 connections) becomes Vertex 8
   - Vertex 6 (5 connections) becomes Vertex 9

3. Traverse the edges and count the triangles formed:
   - Edge (0, 1): Check common connections between Vertex 4 and Vertex 5.
     - Common connections: Vertex 6
     - Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>
   - Edge (0, 5): Proceed
   - Edge (0, 6): Proceed
   - Edge (1, 0): Skip (already counted)
   - Edge (1, 4): Proceed
   - Edge (1, 5): Proceed
   - Edge (2, 5): Skip (Vertex 1 has more connections)
   - Edge (3, 5): Skip (Vertex 1 has more connections)
   - Edge (3, 6): Proceed
   - Edge (4, 1): Skip (already counted)
   - Edge (4, 6): Proceed
   - Edge (4, 8): Check common connections between Vertex 2 and Vertex 0.
     - Common connections: None
   - Edge (4, 9): Proceed
   - Edge (5, 0): Skip (already counted)
   - Edge (5, 1): Skip (already counted)
   - Edge (5, 2): Skip (Vertex 1 has more connections)
   - Edge (5, 3): Skip (Vertex 1 has more connections)
   - Edge (6, 0): Skip (already counted)
   - Edge (6, 3): Skip (Vertex 1 has more connections)
   - Edge (6, 4): Proceed
   - Edge (6, 9): Proceed
   - Edge (8, 4): Check common connections between Vertex 2 and Vertex 0.
     - Common connections: None
   - Edge (9, 4): Proceed
   - Edge (9, 6): Proceed

4. Total number of triangles: 4
5. Unique triangles found: <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>
