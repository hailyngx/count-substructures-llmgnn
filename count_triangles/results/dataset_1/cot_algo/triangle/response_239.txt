Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees:

Node 3: degree 0
Nodes 2 and 6: degree 1
Nodes 1 and 7: degree 2
Nodes 8 and 3: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Nodes 4 and 5 and 9: degree 5

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 share 3 common connections (7, 9, 1). <0, 4, 1>
2. Edge (0, 7): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 and Node 9 share 2 common connections (4, 5). <0, 9, 4>
4. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 and Node 4 share 1 common connection (5). <1, 4, 5>
5. Edge (1, 5): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (4, 0): Already counted in edge 1.
9. Edge (4, 1): Already counted in edge 4.
10. Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (4, 9): Already counted in edge 3.
12. Edge (5, 1): Already counted in edge 4.
13. Edge (5, 2): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (5, 7): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (5, 9): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (6, 1): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (7, 0): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (7, 5): No triangle formed.
20. Edge (8, 4): Already counted in edge 10.
21. Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed.
22. Edge (8, 9): No triangle formed.
23. Edge (9, 0): Already counted in edge 3.
24. Edge (9, 4): Already counted in edge 3.
25. Edge (9, 5): No triangle formed.
26. Edge (9, 8): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 1>, <0, 9, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, and <4, 8, 9>.
