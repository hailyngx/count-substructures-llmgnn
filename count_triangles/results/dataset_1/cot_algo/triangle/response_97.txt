Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we get the following list: 

Vertices: (0-3), (4), (5), (6-8), (9)

Now, we will check for triangles by examining each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. 

(0, 1): Both connect to vertex 6, forming the triangle <0, 1, 6>.
(0, 6): No triangles formed.
(0, 9): No triangles formed.
(1, 2): No triangles formed.
(1, 3): Both connect to vertex 5, forming the triangle <1, 3, 5>.
(1, 5): No triangles formed.
(1, 6): No triangles formed.
(1, 7): No triangles formed.
(2, 3): Both connect to vertex 1, forming the triangle <2, 3, 1>.
(2, 4): No triangles formed.
(2, 5): No triangles formed.
(3, 5): Both connect to vertex 1, forming the triangle <3, 5, 1>.
(3, 6): Both connect to vertex 1, forming the triangle <3, 6, 1>.
(3, 7): No triangles formed.
(4, 6): No triangles formed.
(5, 6): No triangles formed.
(6, 7): No triangles formed.
(6, 8): No triangles formed.
(6, 9): No triangles formed.
(7, 9): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <1, 3, 5>, and <2, 3, 1>.
