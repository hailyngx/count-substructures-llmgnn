Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
1: 0, 3, 5, 6
2: 0, 3, 5
3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
4: 3, 8
5: 0, 1, 2, 7
6: 1, 8
7: 5, 9
8: 4, 6
9: 0, 3, 7
```

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree in increasing order:

```
0: 5
1: 4
2: 3
3: 5
4: 2
5: 4
6: 2
7: 2
8: 2
9: 3
```

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we can count the number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 4>, <7, 9, 0>
