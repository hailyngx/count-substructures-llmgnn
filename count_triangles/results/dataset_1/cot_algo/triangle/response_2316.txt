Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of the nodes is: 

Node 8, Node 7, Node 6, Node 9, Node 1, Node 0, Node 5, Node 3, Node 4, Node 2

Checking each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we find the following triangles: 
- Triangle <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle <2, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
