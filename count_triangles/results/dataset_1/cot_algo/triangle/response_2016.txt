Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
0 -- 3 -- 7
|         |
|         |
9 -- 1     8
|       \ /
2 -- 4   6
    |
    5
```

After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have:
1. Node 4: Degree 1
2. Node 5: Degree 1
3. Node 1: Degree 1
4. Node 0: Degree 2
5. Node 8: Degree 2
6. Node 9: Degree 3
7. Node 7: Degree 3
8. Node 2: Degree 3
9. Node 6: Degree 4
10. Node 3: Degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 3) is counted as a triangle with vertices 0, 3, 7.
- Edge (0, 7) is counted as a triangle with vertices 0, 7, 3.
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 0) is already counted.
- Edge (3, 6) is counted as a triangle with vertices 3, 6, 0.
- Edge (3, 7) is already counted.
- Edge (3, 9) is counted as a triangle with vertices 3, 9, 6.
- Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 3) is already counted.
- Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) is already counted.
- Edge (7, 0) is already counted.
- Edge (7, 3) is already counted.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) is already counted.
- Edge (9, 6) is already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 7>, <3, 6, 0>, <3, 9, 6>.
