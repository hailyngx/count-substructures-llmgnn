Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 7: 0 connections
Vertex 10: 0 connections
Vertices 1, 2, 3, and 5: 3 connections each
Vertices 8 and 6: 4 connections each
Vertices 4 and 9: 5 connections each

Now, we'll relabel the vertices:
Vertex 1 (3 connections) becomes Vertex A
Vertex 2 (3 connections) becomes Vertex B
Vertex 3 (3 connections) becomes Vertex C
Vertex 5 (3 connections) becomes Vertex D
Vertex 8 (4 connections) becomes Vertex E
Vertex 6 (4 connections) becomes Vertex F
Vertex 4 (5 connections) becomes Vertex G
Vertex 9 (5 connections) becomes Vertex H
Vertex 7 and Vertex 10 will not be included in the analysis since they have 0 connections.

Now, analyzing the edges considering the lower label:
- Edge (1, 4): Vertex A and Vertex G share connections with Vertex 9 forming triangle <A, G, H>.
- Edge (1, 5): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (1, 9): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (2, 3): Vertex B and Vertex C share connections with Vertex 6 forming triangle <B, C, F>.
- Edge (2, 4): Vertex B and Vertex G share connections with Vertex 9 forming triangle <B, G, H>.
- Edge (2, 6): Vertex B and Vertex F share connections with Vertex 3 forming triangle <B, F, C>.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (3, 6): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (4, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (4, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (4, 8): Vertex G and Vertex E share connections with Vertex 9 forming triangle <G, E, H>.
- Edge (4, 9): Already counted.
- Edge (5, 1): Already checked.
- Edge (5, 3): Already checked.
- Edge (6, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (6, 3): Already checked.
- Edge (6, 9): Already counted.
- Edge (8, 4): Already checked.
- Edge (9, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 4): Already checked.
- Edge (9, 6): Already checked.

Thus, there are a total of [3] triangles in the graph, namely <A, G, H>, <B, G, H>, and <B, F, C>.
