Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. After relabeling the vertices accordingly, we can start counting the triangles.

The sorted vertices are: 8, 6, 7, 2, 0, 5, 9, 4, 1, 3.

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge in the graph:

1. (0, 1) - No triangle.
2. (0, 2) - No triangle.
3. (0, 3) - No triangle.
4. (0, 8) - No triangle.
5. (1, 3) - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>.
6. (1, 4) - No triangle.
7. (1, 5) - No triangle.
8. (1, 7) - No triangle.
9. (2, 3) - No triangle.
10. (3, 4) - Triangle formed: <1, 3, 4>.
11. (3, 7) - No triangle.
12. (3, 9) - No triangle.
13. (4, 9) - No triangle.
14. (5, 6) - No triangle.
15. (5, 9) - No triangle.
16. (6, 9) - No triangle.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 4>.
