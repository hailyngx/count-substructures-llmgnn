Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 1

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. (7, 1) -> <7, 1, x>
2. (8, 6) -> <8, 6, x>
3. (9, 4) -> <9, 4, x>
4. (1, 3) -> No triangle
5. (1, 4) -> <1, 4, x>
6. (1, 7) -> No triangle
7. (3, 4) -> <3, 4, x>
8. (4, 6) -> No triangle
9. (4, 9) -> No triangle
10. (3, 1) -> <3, 1, x>
11. (4, 1) -> <4, 1, x>
12. (4, 3) -> No triangle
13. (6, 4) -> No triangle

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <7, 1, x>, <8, 6, x>, <9, 4, x>, <1, 4, x>, <3, 1, x>
