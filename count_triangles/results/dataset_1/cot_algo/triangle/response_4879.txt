Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 
1 → 0 connections
2 → 1 connection
4 → 1 connection
6 → 1 connection
5 → 2 connections
8 → 2 connections
3 → 5 connections
7 → 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This gives us the following unique triangles:
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 3>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
