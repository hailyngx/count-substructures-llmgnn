Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 0 → Degree 2
Node 1 → Degree 1
Node 2 → Degree 1
Node 3 → Degree 3
Node 4 → Degree 2
Node 5 → Degree 4
Node 6 → Degree 4
Node 7 → Degree 3
Node 8 → Degree 2
Node 9 → Degree 1

Triangles formed by the given graph are: 
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
