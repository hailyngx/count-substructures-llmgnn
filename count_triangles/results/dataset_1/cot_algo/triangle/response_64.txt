Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new order is as follows:
Node 3 - 2 connections
Node 1 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 0 connections
Node 0 - 3 connections
Node 6 - 4 connections
Node 7 - 3 connections
Node 4 - 4 connections
Node 2 - 6 connections
Node 8 - 4 connections
Node 9 - 5 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2): The shared connections are 4 and 6, forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 4): The shared connections are 2 and 6, forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
3. Edge (0, 8): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (1, 6): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (2, 3): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (2, 7): The shared connections are 1 and 4, forming a triangle <1, 2, 4>.
9. Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (2, 9): The shared connection is 4, forming a triangle <2, 4, 9>.
11. Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (4, 6): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (4, 7): The shared connections are 1 and 2, forming a triangle <1, 2, 4>.
14. Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
15. Edge (6, 1): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (6, 2): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (6, 4): No triangles formed.
18. Edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.
19. Edge (7, 2): The shared connections are 4 and 1, forming a triangle <1, 2, 4>.
20. Edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
21. Edge (8, 0): No triangles formed.
22. Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed.
23. Edge (8, 9): No triangles formed.
24. Edge (9, 2): The shared connection is 4, forming a triangle <2, 4, 9>.
25. Edge (9, 3): No triangles formed.
26. Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.
27. Edge (9, 8): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles found: <0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 4>.
