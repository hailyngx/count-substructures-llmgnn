Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we get the following list:
Vertices: 1, 3, 8, 0, 4, 7, 9, 6, 5, 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

Calculating triangles for each edge:
1. Edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 has 2 connections, and Vertex 5 has 6 connections. Checking for shared connections, they share vertices 1 and 9. So, triangle <0, 1, 5> is formed.
2. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has 2 connections, and Vertex 9 also has 2 connections. They share no common connections.
3. Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, and Vertex 2 has 4 connections. They share vertex 5. So, triangle <1, 5, 2> is formed.
4. Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 has 4 connections, and Vertex 4 has 2 connections. They share vertex 6. So, triangle <2, 6, 4> is formed.
5. Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 has 4 connections, and Vertex 6 has 4 connections. They share vertices 4 and 5. So, triangle <2, 4, 6> is formed.
6. Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 has 4 connections, and Vertex 7 has 3 connections. They share vertex 2. So, triangle <2, 6, 7> is formed.
7. Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 has 2 connections, and Vertex 5 has 6 connections. They share vertices 1 and 9. So, triangle <3, 1, 5> is formed.
8. Edge (3, 7): Vertex 3 has 2 connections, and Vertex 7 has 3 connections. They share no common connections.
9. Edge (4, 2): Vertex 4 has 2 connections, and Vertex 2 has 4 connections. They share vertex 6. So, triangle <4, 6, 2> is formed.
10. Edge (4, 6): Already counted in step 5.
11. Edge (5, 0): Already counted in step 1.
12. Edge (5, 1): Already counted in step 3.
13. Edge (5, 3): Already counted in step 7.
14. Edge (5, 6): Already counted in step 5.
15. Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5 has 6 connections, and Vertex 8 has 2 connections. They share no common connections.
16. Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 has 6 connections, and Vertex 9 also has 2 connections. They share no common connections.
17. Edge (6, 2): Already counted in step 6.
18. Edge (6, 4): Already counted in step 9.
19. Edge (6, 5): Already counted in step 5.
20. Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 has 4 connections, and Vertex 9 has 2 connections. They share vertex 5. So, triangle <6, 5, 9> is formed.
21. Edge (7, 2): Already counted in step 6.
22. Edge (7, 3): Already counted in step 7.
23. Edge (7, 8): Vertex 7 has 3 connections, and Vertex 8 has 2 connections. They share no common connections.
24. Edge (8, 5): Already counted in step 15.
