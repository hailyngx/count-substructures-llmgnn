Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is: 1(1), 0(3), 8(3), 5(3), 9(3), 6(4), 7(4), 4(5), 2(6).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge in the graph:
- Edge (0, 2): Forms triangles with 4 and 5. <0, 2, 4> and <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle with 2. <0, 4, 2>
- Edge (0, 5): Forms a triangle with 2. <0, 5, 2>
- Edge (1, 4): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 5): Forms a triangle with 0. <2, 5, 0>
- Edge (2, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with 2. <4, 7, 2>
- Edge (4, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 6): Forms a triangle with 2. <5, 6, 2>
- Edge (7, 8): Forms a triangle with 2. <7, 8, 2>
- Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
