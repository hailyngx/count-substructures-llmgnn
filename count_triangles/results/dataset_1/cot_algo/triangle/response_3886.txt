Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Now, we will process the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Edge (0, 4): Shared connections with 2, 3 forming triangle <0, 2, 3>.
Edge (0, 9): No triangle.
Edge (1, 3): Shared connection with 4 forming triangle <1, 3, 4>.
Edge (1, 6): Shared connection with 4 forming triangle <1, 4, 6>.
Edge (1, 7): No triangle.
Edge (2, 4): No triangle.
Edge (2, 9): No triangle.
Edge (3, 1): Shared connection with 4 forming triangle <1, 3, 4>.
Edge (3, 4): Shared connection with 0 forming triangle <0, 3, 4> and shared connection with 1 forming triangle <1, 3, 4>.
Edge (3, 9): Shared connection with 6 forming triangle <3, 6, 9>.
Edge (4, 0): Shared connections with 3 forming triangle <0, 3, 4> and shared connection with 2 forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
Edge (4, 2): Shared connection with 3 forming triangle <0, 2, 3> and shared connection with 0 forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
Edge (4, 3): Shared connections with 0 forming triangle <0, 3, 4> and with 1 forming triangle <1, 3, 4>.
Edge (4, 6): Shared connections with 1 forming triangle <1, 4, 6> and with 3 forming triangle <3, 4, 6>.
Edge (4, 8): No triangle.
Edge (5, 6): No triangle.
Edge (5, 7): No triangle.
Edge (6, 1): Shared connections with 4 forming triangle <1, 4, 6> and shared connection with 7 forming triangle <1, 6, 7>.
Edge (6, 4): Shared connections with 1 forming triangle <1, 4, 6> and with 3 forming triangle <3, 4, 6>.
Edge (6, 5): No triangle.
Edge (6, 9): No triangle.
Edge (7, 1): No triangle.
Edge (7, 5): No triangle.
Edge (8, 4): No triangle.
Edge (9, 0): No triangle.
Edge (9, 2): No triangle.
Edge (9, 3): Shared connection with 6 forming triangle <3, 6, 9>.
Edge (9, 6): No triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 6>.
