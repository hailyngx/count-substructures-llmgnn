Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections). Let's relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 0 has degree 4
Vertex 1 has degree 2
Vertex 2 has degree 4
Vertex 3 has degree 3
Vertex 4 has degree 4
Vertex 5 has degree 3
Vertex 6 has degree 2
Vertex 7 has degree 5
Vertex 8 has degree 3

Next, we will go through the given edges and count the triangles:

For edge (0, 2):
Vertex 0 (degree 4) < Vertex 2 (degree 4)
Shared connections: 3, 4
Triangles formed: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>

For edge (0, 3):
Vertex 0 (degree 4) < Vertex 3 (degree 3)
Shared connections: 2
Triangles formed: <0, 2, 3>

For edge (0, 4):
Vertex 0 (degree 4) < Vertex 4 (degree 4)
Shared connections: 2
Triangles formed: <0, 2, 4>

For edge (0, 6):
Vertex 0 (degree 4) < Vertex 6 (degree 2)
Shared connections: None
No triangles formed.

For edge (1, 4):
Vertex 1 (degree 2) < Vertex 4 (degree 4)
Shared connections: None
No triangles formed.

For edge (1, 8):
Vertex 1 (degree 2) < Vertex 8 (degree 3)
Shared connections: None
No triangles formed.

For edge (2, 3):
Vertex 2 (degree 4) < Vertex 3 (degree 3)
Shared connections: 0
Triangles formed: <0, 2, 3>

(Continuing to check remaining edges)

After checking all edges, the total number of triangles found in the graph is: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>
