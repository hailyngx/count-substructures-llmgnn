Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degree:

0: degree 6
1: degree 4
6: degree 5
5: degree 2
8: degree 3
7: degree 2
3: degree 1
2: degree 1
9: degree 2
4: degree 2

Next, we will go through each edge in increasing order of the vertex with the lower label and count the triangles:

Triangles: [<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 8>]

Total number of triangles: [8]
