Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 7 [Degree 1]
- Node 1 [Degree 2]
- Node 0 [Degree 1]
- Node 6 [Degree 2]
- Node 9 [Degree 3]
- Node 3 [Degree 4]
- Node 8 [Degree 4]
- Node 5 [Degree 4]
- Node 4 [Degree 5]
- Node 2 [Degree 0]

Now, considering each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles formed:
- Triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle <3, 4, 8>
- Triangle <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle <3, 5, 8>
- Triangle <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <4, 5, 8>
- Triangle <4, 5, 9>
- Triangle <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [10].
