Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices in ascending order of their degrees (number of connections). The sorted list of vertices is: 

Vertex 0: Degree 1  
Vertex 1: Not present  
Vertex 2: Degree 2  
Vertex 3: Degree 3  
Vertex 4: Degree 2  
Vertex 5: Degree 5  
Vertex 6: Degree 4  
Vertex 7: Degree 4  
Vertex 8: Degree 3  
Vertex 9: Degree 6  

Now, let's go through the edges and count the number of triangles present:

1. Edge (0, 9): Skipped because vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
2. Edge (2, 4): Skipped because vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 4.
3. Edge (2, 5): Skipped because vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 5.
4. Edge (3, 4): Skipped because vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 4.
5. Edge (3, 7): Skipped because vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 7.
6. Edge (3, 9): Skipped because vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
7. Edge (4, 2): Skipped because vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 2.
8. Edge (4, 3): Skipped because vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 3.
9. Edge (5, 2): Skipped because vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 5.
10. Edge (5, 6): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>
11. Edge (5, 7): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>
12. Edge (5, 8): Skipped because vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 8.
13. Edge (5, 9): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>
14. Edge (6, 5): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>
15. Edge (6, 7): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>
16. Edge (6, 8): Skipped because vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 8.
17. Edge (6, 9): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>
18. Edge (7, 3): Skipped because vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 3.
19. Edge (7, 5): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>
20. Edge (7, 6): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>
21. Edge (7, 9): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>
22. Edge (8, 5): Skipped because vertex 8 has fewer connections than vertex 5.
23. Edge (8, 6): Skipped because vertex 8 has fewer connections than vertex 6.
24. Edge (8, 9): Skipped because vertex 8 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
25. Edge (9, 0): Skipped because vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 0.
26. Edge (9, 3): Skipped because vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 3.
27. Edge (9, 5): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>
28. Edge (9, 6): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>
29. Edge (9, 7): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>
30. Edge (9, 8): Skipped because vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 8.

The total number of triangles found is 7, and the unique triangles are: <5, 6, 7>. 

Therefore, the output is: [7]
