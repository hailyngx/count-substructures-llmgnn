Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3

Now we relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 2 (degree 1) becomes node 0
- Node 3 (degree 2) becomes node 1
- Node 6 (degree 2) becomes node 2
- Node 8 (degree 2) becomes node 3
- Node 7 (degree 3) becomes node 4 
- Node 9 (degree 3) becomes node 5
- Node 4 (degree 3) becomes node 6
- Node 0 (degree 4) becomes node 7
- Node 1 (degree 4) becomes node 8
- Node 5 (degree 4) becomes node 9

Now, we need to check the edges in the order of the labels:
1. (0, 1): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
2. (0, 5): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
3. (0, 8): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
4. (0, 9): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
5. (1, 4): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
6. (1, 5): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
7. (1, 8): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
8. (2, 4): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
9. (3, 6): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
10. (3, 7): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
11. (4, 9): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
12. (5, 6): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
13. (5, 7): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
14. (6, 5): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
15. (7, 9): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
16. (8, 0): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
17. (9, 7): Check for shared connections. No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
