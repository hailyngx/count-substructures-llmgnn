Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0 with 5 connections
Node 1 with 4 connections
Node 2 with 4 connections
Node 3 with 2 connections
Node 4 with 3 connections
Node 5 with 3 connections
Node 6 with 3 connections
Node 7 with 4 connections
Node 8 with 1 connection
Node 9 with 4 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering method, we look at each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Using this approach, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
