Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 has 6 connections and Vertex 4 has 2 connections. Checking shared connections gives us a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
- Edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 has 6 connections and Vertex 5 has 2 connections. Checking shared connections gives us a triangle <0, 5, 1>.
- Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 has 6 connections and Vertex 6 has 2 connections. Checking shared connections gives us a triangle <0, 6, 2>.
- Edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 has 6 connections and Vertex 7 has 1 connection. Checking shared connections gives us no triangles.
- Edge (1, 5): Proceeding with Vertex 1.
- Edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 has 1 connection and Vertex 9 has 5 connections. Checking shared connections gives us no triangles.
- Edge (2, 6): Proceeding with Vertex 2.
- Edge (2, 8): Vertex 2 has 3 connections and Vertex 8 has 1 connection. Checking shared connections gives us no triangles.
- Edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has 3 connections and Vertex 9 has 5 connections. Checking shared connections gives us a triangle <2, 9, 1>.
- Edge (3, 7): Proceeding with Vertex 3.
- Edge (4, 9): Proceeding with Vertex 4.
- Edge (8, 9): Proceeding with Vertex 8.

Count of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 6, 2>
