Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degrees:

Node 0: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5

Next, we will relabel the nodes according to their degrees:

Node 0: Degree 1 → Label 0
Node 1: Degree 2 → Label 1
Node 5: Degree 2 → Label 2
Node 7: Degree 4 → Label 3
Node 4: Degree 4 → Label 4
Node 6: Degree 4 → Label 5
Node 8: Degree 4 → Label 6
Node 9: Degree 4 → Label 7
Node 2: Degree 5 → Label 8
Node 3: Degree 5 → Label 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 7):
    - Node 0 (Label 0) has no connections fewer than Node 7 (Label 3), so we skip this edge.
2. Edge (1, 5):
    - Node 1 (Label 1) has fewer connections than Node 5 (Label 2).
    - Node 1 and Node 5 share Node 3 (Label 9) as a common connection, forming a triangle <1, 3, 5>.
3. Edge (2, 3):
    - Node 2 (Label 8) has fewer connections than Node 3 (Label 9).
    - Node 2 and Node 3 share Node 6 (Label 5) as a common connection, forming a triangle <2, 3, 6>.
    - Node 2 and Node 3 also share Node 8 (Label 6) as a common connection, forming a triangle <2, 3, 8>.
4. Edge (2, 6):
    - Node 2 (Label 8) has fewer connections than Node 6 (Label 5).
    - Node 2 and Node 6 share Node 8 (Label 6) as a common connection, forming a triangle <2, 6, 8>.
5. Edge (2, 8):
    - Node 2 (Label 8) has fewer connections than Node 8 (Label 6).
    - Node 2 and Node 8 share Node 3 (Label 9) as a common connection, forming a triangle <2, 3, 8>.
6. Edge (3, 5):
    - Node 3 (Label 9) has fewer connections than Node 5 (Label 2), but we have already counted this in step 2.
7. Edge (3, 7):
    - Node 3 (Label 9) has fewer connections than Node 7 (Label 3).
    - Node 3 and Node 7 share Node 4 (Label 4) as a common connection, forming a triangle <3, 4, 7>.
    - Node 3 and Node 7 also share Node 9 (Label 7) as a common connection, forming a triangle <3, 7, 9>.
8. Edge (3, 9):
    - Node 3 (Label 9) has fewer connections than Node 9 (Label 7).
    - Node 3 and Node 9 share Node 4 (Label 4) as a common connection, forming a triangle <3, 4, 9>.
9. Edge (4, 7):
    - Node 4 (Label 4) has fewer connections than Node 7 (Label 3).
    - Node 4 and Node 7 share Node 9 (Label 7) as a common connection, forming a triangle <4, 7, 9>.
10. Edge (4, 8):
    - Node 4 (Label 4) has fewer connections than Node 8 (Label 6).
    - Node 4 and Node 8 share Node 6 (Label 5) as a common connection, forming a triangle <4, 6, 8>.
    - Node 4 and Node 8 also share Node 9 (Label 7) as a common connection, forming a triangle <4, 8, 9>.
11. Edge (4, 9):
    - Node 4 (Label 4) has fewer connections than Node 9 (Label 7), but we have already counted this in step 9.
12. Edge (5, 1):
    - Node 5 (Label 2) has fewer connections than Node 1 (Label 1), but we have already counted this in step 2.
13. Edge (5, 3):
    - Node 5 (Label 2) has fewer connections than Node 3 (Label 9), but we have already counted this in step 2.
14. Edge (6, 2):
    - Node 6 (Label 5) has fewer connections than Node 2 (Label 8), but we have already counted this in step 4.
15. Edge (6, 8):
    - Node 6 (Label 5) has fewer connections than Node 8 (Label 6), but we have already counted this in step 4.
16. Edge (6, 9):
    - Node 6 (Label 5) has fewer connections than Node 9 (Label 7).
    - Node 6 and Node 9 share Node 4 (Label 4) as a common connection, forming a triangle <4, 6, 9>.
17. Edge (7, 0):
    - Node 7 (Label 3) has fewer connections than Node 0 (Label 0), but we have already counted this in step 1.
18. Edge (7, 3):
    - Node 7 (Label 3) has fewer connections than Node 3 (Label 9), but we have already counted this in step 7.
19. Edge (7, 4):
    - Node 7 (Label 3) has fewer connections than Node 4 (Label 4).
    - Node 7 and Node 4 share Node 9 (Label 7) as a common connection, forming a triangle <4, 7, 9>.
20. Edge (8, 2):
    - Node 8 (Label 6) has fewer connections than Node 2 (Label 8), but we have already counted this in step 5.
21. Edge (8, 4):
    - Node 8 (Label 6) has fewer connections than Node 4 (Label 4), but we have already counted this in step 10.
22. Edge (8, 6):
    - Node 8 (Label 6) has fewer connections than Node 6 (Label 5), but we have already counted this in step 15.
23. Edge (9, 3):
    - Node 9 (Label 7) has fewer connections than Node 3 (Label 9), but we have already counted this in step 8.
24. Edge (9, 4):
    - Node 9 (Label 7) has fewer connections than Node 4 (Label 4), but we have already counted this in step 11.
25. Edge (9, 6):
    - Node 9 (Label 7) has fewer connections than Node 6 (Label 5), but we have already counted this in step 16.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5], and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, and <4, 6, 9>.
