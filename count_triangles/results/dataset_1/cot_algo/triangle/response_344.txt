Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes: 5, 9, 0, 2, 5, 3, 8, 6, 1, 7

After relabeling based on degree: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
