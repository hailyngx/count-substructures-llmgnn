Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 6 has 0 connections.
Nodes 7 and 8 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 3, 5, 9 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 1 and 0 have 3 connections each.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.

Next, we relabel the nodes based on their degree:

Node 6 (0 connections) -> Node 1
Nodes 7 and 8 (1 connection) -> Nodes 2 and 3
Nodes 3, 5, 9 (2 connections) -> Nodes 4, 5, and 6
Nodes 1 and 0 (3 connections) -> Nodes 7 and 8
Node 2 (4 connections) -> Node 9
Node 4 (5 connections) -> Node 10

Now, we go through each edge to count the number of triangles:

For the edge (0, 4):
Node 1 (0-connections node) does not have fewer connections.
For the edge (0, 9):
Node 1 (0-connections node) does not have fewer connections.
For the edge (1, 3):
Node 2 (1-connection node) does have fewer connections. Shared connection with Node 4 -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>
For the edge (1, 4):
Node 2 (1-connection node) does have fewer connections. Shared connection with Node 10 -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 10>
For the edge (1, 9):
Node 2 (1-connection node) does have fewer connections. Shared connection with Node 6 -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>
For the edge (2, 4):
Node 3 (2-connection node) does have fewer connections.
For the edge (2, 5):
Node 3 (2-connection node) does have fewer connections.
For the edge (2, 8):
Node 3 (2-connection node) does have fewer connections.
For the edge (3, 1):
Node 4 (2-connection node) does have fewer connections.
For the edge (4, 0):
Node 5 (3-connection node) does have fewer connections.
For the edge (4, 1):
Node 5 (3-connection node) does have fewer connections.
For the edge (4, 2):
Node 5 (3-connection node) does have fewer connections.
For the edge (5, 2):
Node 6 (2-connection node) does have fewer connections.
For the edge (5, 7):
Node 6 (2-connection node) does have fewer connections.
For the edge (7, 5):
Node 8 (1-connection node) does have fewer connections.
For the edge (8, 2):
Node 9 (1-connection node) does have fewer connections.
For the edge (9, 0):
Node 10 (1-connection node) does have fewer connections.
For the edge (9, 1):
Node 10 (1-connection node) does have fewer connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <2, 3, 5>, <2, 6, 9>, and <2, 4, 10>.
