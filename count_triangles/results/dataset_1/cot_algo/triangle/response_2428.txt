Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, the vertices need to be sorted based on their degrees:

- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 1 connection
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

- Vertex 6 (Degree: 1) -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 9 (Degree: 1) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 0 (Degree: 2) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 2 (Degree: 2) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 4 (Degree: 2) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 1 (Degree: 2) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 7 (Degree: 3) -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 8 (Degree: 3) -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 5 (Degree: 4) -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 3 (Degree: 4) -> Vertex 9

Next, we examine each edge according to the labeling:

- Edge (0, 2) forms triangle with shared connection: 5
- Edge (0, 5) does not form triangle
- Edge (1, 4) does not form triangle
- Edge (1, 8) forms triangle with shared connections: 3, 5
- Edge (2, 0) does not form triangle
- Edge (3, 5) forms triangle with shared connections: 7, 8
- Edge (3, 7) does not form triangle
- Edge (3, 8) does not form triangle
- Edge (3, 9) does not form triangle
- Edge (4, 1) does not form triangle
- Edge (4, 6) does not form triangle
- Edge (5, 0) does not form triangle
- Edge (5, 3) forms triangle with shared connections: 7, 8
- Edge (5, 7) does not form triangle
- Edge (5, 8) does not form triangle
- Edge (6, 4) does not form triangle
- Edge (7, 3) does not form triangle
- Edge (7, 5) does not form triangle
- Edge (8, 1) forms triangle with shared connections: 3, 5
- Edge (8, 3) does not form triangle
- Edge (8, 5) does not form triangle
- Edge (9, 3) does not form triangle

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles: <2, 5, 8>
