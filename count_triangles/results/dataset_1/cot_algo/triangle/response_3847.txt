Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 4 has degree 0
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 6

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and examining the given edges, we can count the number of triangles:

- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <2, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
