Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After reordering the nodes based on their degrees, the new ordering is: 4, 1, 6, 7, 5, 9, 0, 3, 2, 8.

Now let's check the shared connections to count the number of triangles:
- Node 4 (degree 1) has edges with node 8 (degree 5) and forms a triangle with node 5 (degree 3): <4, 5, 8>.
- Node 1 (degree 1) has an edge with node 5 (degree 3) but there are no shared connections to form a triangle.
- Node 6 (degree 1) has an edge with node 0 (degree 4) but there are no shared connections to form a triangle.
- Node 7 (degree 1) has an edge with node 0 (degree 4) and forms a triangle with node 3 (degree 4): <7, 0, 3>.
- Node 5 (degree 3) has edges with nodes 1 (degree 1), 3 (degree 4), and 8 (degree 5) but all possible triangles are already counted.
- Node 9 (degree 1) has edges with node 2 (degree 4) and forms a triangle with node 3 (degree 4): <9, 2, 3>.
- Node 0 (degree 4) has edges with nodes 2 (degree 4), 6 (degree 1), 7 (degree 1), and 8 (degree 5) but all possible triangles are already counted.
- Node 3 (degree 4) has edges with nodes 2 (degree 4), 5 (degree 3), 7 (degree 1), 8 (degree 5), and 9 (degree 1) but all possible triangles are already counted.
- Node 2 (degree 4) has edges with nodes 0 (degree 4), 3 (degree 4), 8 (degree 5), and 9 (degree 1) but all possible triangles are already counted.
- Node 8 (degree 5) has edges with nodes 0 (degree 4), 2 (degree 4), 3 (degree 4), 4 (degree 1), and 5 (degree 3) but all possible triangles are already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
