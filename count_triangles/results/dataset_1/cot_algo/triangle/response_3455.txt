Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- 0 (degree 4)
- 1 (degree 2)
- 2 (degree 2)
- 3 (degree 2)
- 4 (degree 2)
- 5 (degree 2)
- 6 (degree 5)
- 7 (degree 2)
- 8 (degree 4)
- 9 (degree 3)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (1, 0) forms triangle <0, 1, 3>
- (1, 3) forms triangle <1, 3, 8>
- (6, 8) forms triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
