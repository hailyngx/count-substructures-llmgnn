Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the updated labels for the vertices are:  
Node 2 has 2 connections.  
Node 5 has 1 connection.  
Node 0 has 2 connections.  
Node 1 has 2 connections.  
Node 4 has 2 connections.  
Node 8 has 3 connections.  
Node 6 has 4 connections.  
Node 9 has 3 connections.  
Node 3 has 5 connections.  
Node 7 has 6 connections.  

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 3): Check for triangles involving vertex 0 and vertex 3. We find triangles <0, 3, 9> and <0, 3, 8>.
- Edge (0, 8): This edge is not proceeded with as the lower-labeled vertex 0 has more connections.
- Edge (1, 6): Check for triangles involving vertex 1 and vertex 6. We find a triangle <1, 6, 4>.
- Edge (1, 7): Check for triangles involving vertex 1 and vertex 7. We find triangles <1, 7, 2> and <1, 7, 6>.
- Edge (2, 7): Check for triangles involving vertex 2 and vertex 7. We find a triangle <2, 7, 1>.
- Edge (2, 8): Check for triangles involving vertex 2 and vertex 8. We find a triangle <2, 8, 0>.
- Edge (3, 0): This edge is not proceeded with as the lower-labeled vertex 0 has more connections.
- Edge (3, 7): Check for triangles involving vertex 3 and vertex 7. We find a triangle <3, 7, 1>.
- Edge (3, 8): Check for triangles involving vertex 3 and vertex 8. We find a triangle <3, 8, 2>.
- Edge (3, 9): Check for triangles involving vertex 3 and vertex 9. We find a triangle <3, 9, 6>.
- Edge (4, 6): Check for triangles involving vertex 4 and vertex 6. We find a triangle <4, 6, 1>.
- Edge (4, 9): This edge is not proceeded with as the lower-labeled vertex 4 has more connections.
- Edge (5, 7): Check for triangles involving vertex 5 and vertex 7. We find no triangles.
- Edge (6, 1): This edge is not proceeded with as the lower-labeled vertex 1 has more connections.
- Edge (6, 4): This edge is not proceeded with as the lower-labeled vertex 4 has more connections.
