Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on the number of connections each node has. Then, we will relabel the nodes accordingly.

Node Degrees:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Nodes sorted by degree:
0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 6

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections between nodes where the node with a lower label has fewer connections, we can find the triangles in the graph.

Triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<3, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [2]
