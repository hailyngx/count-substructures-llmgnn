Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by degree and relabeling them accordingly, the new order of vertices based on the number of connections is: 

Node 3 (Degree 2) <br>
Node 5 (Degree 2) <br>
Node 4 (Degree 2) <br>
Node 0 (Degree 4) <br>
Node 2 (Degree 4) <br>
Node 6 (Degree 6) <br>
Node 1 (Degree 7) <br>
Node 9 (Degree 7) <br>
Node 8 (Degree 7) <br>
Node 7 (Degree 8) 

Now, we will find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For edge (0, 1): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (0, 7): Triangle <0, 7, 2> is formed.
- For edge (0, 9): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (1, 6): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (1, 7): Triangle <1, 7, 6> is formed.
- For edge (1, 9): Triangle <1, 9, 3> is formed.
- For edge (2, 7): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (2, 8): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (3, 8): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (3, 9): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (4, 9): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (5, 6): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (6, 7): No triangle is formed.
- For edge (6, 8): Triangle <6, 8, 2> is formed.
- For edge (7, 8): Triangle <7, 8, 2> is formed.
- For edge (8, 9): Triangle <8, 9, 4> is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 7, 2>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 9, 3>, <6, 8, 2>, and <8, 9, 4>.
