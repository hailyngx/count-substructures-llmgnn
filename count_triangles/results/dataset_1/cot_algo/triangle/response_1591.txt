Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices is as follows:
Node 9 - 2 connections
Node 0 - 2 connections
Node 6 - 3 connections
Node 2 - 3 connections
Node 7 - 4 connections
Node 5 - 4 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 8 - 6 connections
Node 3 - 6 connections
Node 4 - 8 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:

From the edges, we see that the vertices with lower labels that share connections are:
(0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 9)

By analyzing the shared connections, we can find the triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
