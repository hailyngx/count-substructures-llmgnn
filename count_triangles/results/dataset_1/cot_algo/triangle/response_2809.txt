Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 6 has 2 connections.
Vertices 7 and 8 have 3 connections each.
Vertices 3, 4, and 9 have 4 connections each.
Vertices 1, 2, and 5 have 5 connections each.
Vertex 0 has 6 connections.

Now, we will relabel the vertices as follows:
Vertex 6 -> A
Vertex 7 -> B
Vertex 8 -> C
Vertex 3 -> D
Vertex 4 -> E
Vertex 9 -> F
Vertex 1 -> G
Vertex 2 -> H
Vertex 5 -> I
Vertex 0 -> J

We will now list the edges that meet the criteria (lower label has fewer connections):

(A, J) forms a triangle with shared connection I.
(B, E) forms a triangle with shared connection I.
(B, I) forms a triangle with shared connection E.
(C, I) forms a triangle with shared connection H.
(D, I) forms a triangle with shared connection J.
(F, I) forms a triangle with shared connection H.
(G, A) forms a triangle with shared connection J.
(G, E) forms a triangle with shared connection I.
(G, I) forms a triangle with shared connection E.
(H, I) forms a triangle with shared connection G.

Counting these unique triangles, we get a total of 9 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9]. 
The unique triangles found are: <A, J, I>, <B, E, I>, <B, I, E>, <C, I, H>, <D, I, J>, <F, I, H>, <G, A, J>, <G, E, I>, <H, I, G>.
