Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

0 (degree 2) <br>
1 (degree 3) <br>
2 (degree 1) <br>
3 (degree 3) <br>
4 (degree 5) <br>
5 (degree 3) <br>
6 (degree 4) <br>
7 (degree 5) <br>
8 (degree 3) <br>
9 (degree 2) <br>

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

From edge (0, 5): <0, 5> form a triangle with shared connection 7.  
From edge (1, 2): No triangles formed.  
From edge (1, 4): <1, 4, 7> form a triangle with shared connection 1.  
From edge (3, 7): No triangles formed.  
From edge (3, 8): No triangles formed.  
From edge (4, 1): No triangles formed.  
From edge (4, 6): No triangles formed.  
From edge (4, 7): <4, 6, 7> form a triangle with shared connection 4.  
From edge (5, 0): No triangles formed.  
From edge (5, 7): No triangles formed.  
From edge (6, 4): <6, 7, 4> form a triangle with shared connection 4.  
From edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.  
From edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.  
From edge (7, 3): No triangles formed.  
From edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.  
From edge (7, 5): No triangles formed.  
From edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.  
From edge (8, 3): No triangles formed.  
From edge (8, 4): No triangles formed.  
From edge (9, 6): No triangles formed.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, and <4, 6, 7>.
