Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the vertices will be relabeled as follows: 

Node 1 (degree 0): 1
Node 4 (degree 0): 2
Node 8 (degree 0): 3
Node 9 (degree 0): 4
Node 0 (degree 4): 5
Node 5 (degree 4): 6
Node 2 (degree 4): 7
Node 7 (degree 4): 8
Node 3 (degree 5): 9
Node 6 (degree 6): 10

Now, we will go through the edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Considering edge (0, 3):
Nodes 5 and 9 share connection with node 3, forming triangle <3, 5, 9>.

Considering edge (0, 6):
Nodes 5 and 10 share connection with node 6, forming triangle <5, 6, 10>. 

Considering edge (0, 8):
No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (0, 9):
No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (1, 2):
No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (1, 7):
No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (2, 1):
No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (2, 5):
No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (2, 6):
Nodes 7 and 10 share connection with node 6, forming triangle <6, 7, 10>.

Considering edge (3, 7):
Nodes 5 and 8 share connection with node 7, forming triangle <5, 7, 8>.

Considering edge (4, 5):
No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (5, 2):
No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (5, 4):
No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (5, 6):
Nodes 7 and 10 share connection with node 6, forming triangle <6, 7, 10>.

Considering edge (6, 0):
Nodes 5 and 9 share connection with node 6, forming triangle <5, 6, 9>. 

Considering edge (6, 2):
Nodes 7 and 10 share connection with node 6, forming triangle <6, 7, 10>. 

Considering edge (6, 5):
Nodes 7 and 10 share connection with node 6, forming triangle <6, 7, 10>.

Considering edge (6, 7):
Nodes 8 and 10 share connection with node 7, forming triangle <7, 8, 10>.

Considering edge (6, 9):
No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (7, 1):
No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (7, 3):
Nodes 5 and 8 share connection with node 7, forming triangle <5, 7, 8>.

Considering edge (7, 6):
Nodes 8 and 10 share connection with node 7, forming triangle <7, 8, 10>.

Considering edge (8, 0):
No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (9, 0):
No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (9, 6):
No triangles are formed.

Based on the above analysis, the total number of triangles is 6, and the list of unique triangles found is <3, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 10>, <6, 7, 10>, <7, 8, 10>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [6].
