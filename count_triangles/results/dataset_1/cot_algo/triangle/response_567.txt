Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Node 3: Degree 1  
Node 1: Degree 1  
Node 6: Degree 1  
Node 9: Degree 1  
Node 2: Degree 1  
Node 5: Degree 3  
Node 1: Degree 3  
Node 8: Degree 3  
Node 4: Degree 4  
Node 0: Degree 6  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting the triangles. 

Triangles:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 4, 1>
3. <0, 4, 5>
4. <0, 7, 5>
5. <0, 7, 8>
6. <4, 7, 5>
7. <4, 0, 5>
8. <4, 1, 7>
9. <7, 5, 8>
10. <8, 5, 0>

Total number of triangles: [10]
