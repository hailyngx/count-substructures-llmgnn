Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in increasing order, we relabel the vertices as follows: 

Node 0 -> 4 connections
Node 1 -> 2 connections
Node 2 -> 3 connections
Node 3 -> 2 connections
Node 4 -> 4 connections
Node 5 -> 2 connections
Node 6 -> 1 connection
Node 7 -> 5 connections
Node 8 -> 3 connections
Node 9 -> 5 connections

Using Degree-Based Ordering, we start counting triangles by processing each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
- <0, 7, 9>
- <1, 8, 9>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <7, 8, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
