Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Vertex 5 (Degree 1)  
Vertex 1 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 4 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 7 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 0 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 6 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 9 (Degree 4)  
Vertex 2 (Degree 5)  
Vertex 8 (Degree 5)  
Vertex 3 (Degree 6)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed to count the triangles:  
1. Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with vertex 1 connecting to vertices 0 and 3.  
2. Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 0 connecting to vertices 1 and 3.  
3. Edge (0, 5) does not form a triangle.  
4. Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 1 connecting to vertices 0 and 3.  
5. Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.  
6. Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.  
7. Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.  
8. Edge (3, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 3 connecting to vertices 0 and 9.  
9. Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 3 connecting to vertices 0 and 9.  
10. Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.  
11. Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle.  
12. Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.  
13. Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.  
14. Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.  
15. Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.  

Total number of triangles: [4]  

Unique triangles found:  
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 3, 6>  
<0, 3, 9>  
<3, 6, 9>
