Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted list of vertices with their connections is as follows:
(0: 2 connections) - (6: 2 connections) - (8: 1 connection) - (3: 2 connections) - (4: 2 connections) - (9: 2 connections) - (5: 4 connections) - (1: 5 connections) - (7: 5 connections) - (2: 5 connections)

Now, we will count the number of triangles present in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 5]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
