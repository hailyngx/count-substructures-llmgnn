Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the graph.

The vertices of the graph sorted by their degree are:
Vertices: 5, 9, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 1, 7, 0

After relabeling based on the sorting:
5 -> 0, 9 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 5 -> 4, 6 -> 5, 8 -> 6, 1 -> 7, 7 -> 8, 0 -> 9

The edges that can form triangles are:
(5, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6)

Calculating the triangles:
1. Triangle with edges (5, 6), (5, 4), (4, 6) or vertices (0, 6, 5) 
2. Triangle with edges (2, 5), (2, 6), (5, 6) or vertices (4, 5, 2)
3. Triangle with edges (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6) or vertices (3, 4, 5)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 6, 5>, <4, 5, 2>, and <3, 4, 5>.
