Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0: 1 connection
2: 1 connection
5: 1 connection
7: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
4: 3 connections
6: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
1: 5 connections
3: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Checking edge (0, 6):
Vertex 0 has 1 connection: No triangle.
Checking edge (1, 3):
Vertex 1 has 5 connections, vertex 3 has 6 connections. Shared connections: 1 (with vertices 4 and 9). Triangle found: <1, 3, 4>.
Checking edge (1, 4):
Vertex 1 has 5 connections: No triangle.
Checking edge (1, 7):
Vertex 1 has 5 connections, vertex 7 has 2 connections. Shared connection: 1. Triangle found: <1, 3, 7>.
Checking edge (1, 9):
Vertex 1 has 5 connections, vertex 9 has 4 connections. Shared connection: 1. Triangle found: <1, 3, 9>.
Checking edge (2, 9):
Vertex 2 has 1 connection: No triangle.
Checking edge (3, 4):
Vertex 3 has 6 connections, vertex 4 has 3 connections. Shared connection: 3. Triangle found: <3, 1, 4>.
Checking edge (3, 6):
Vertex 3 has 6 connections, vertex 6 has 4 connections. Shared connection: None. No triangle.
Checking edge (3, 8):
Vertex 3 has 6 connections, vertex 8 has 2 connections. Shared connection: None. No triangle.
Checking edge (3, 9):
Vertex 3 has 6 connections, vertex 9 has 4 connections. Shared connection: 3. Triangle found: <3, 1, 9>.
Checking edge (5, 6):
Vertex 5 has 1 connection: No triangle.
Checking edge (6, 0):
Vertex 6 has 4 connections, vertex 0 has 1 connection. Shared connection: None. No triangle.
Checking edge (6, 3):
Vertex 6 has 4 connections, vertex 3 has 6 connections. Shared connection: None. No triangle.
Checking edge (6, 5):
Vertex 6 has 4 connections, vertex 5 has 1 connection. Shared connection: None. No triangle.
Checking edge (7, 1):
Vertex 7 has 2 connections: No triangle.
Checking edge (7, 8):
Vertex 7 has 2 connections, vertex 8 has 2 connections. Shared connection: None. No triangle.
Checking edge (8, 3):
Vertex 8 has 2 connections: No triangle.
Checking edge (8, 7):
Vertex 8 has 2 connections: No triangle.
Checking edge (9, 1):
Vertex 9 has 4 connections: No triangle.
Checking edge (9, 2):
Vertex 9 has 4 connections, vertex 2 has 1 connection. Shared connection: None. No triangle.
Checking edge (9, 3):
Vertex 9 has 4 connections: No triangle.

Total number of triangles: 3
Triangles: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 9>
