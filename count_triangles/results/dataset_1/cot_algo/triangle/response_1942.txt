Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each node:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on the number of connections from least to most:
- Node 3: 1
- Node 5: 1
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 2
- Node 4: 2
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 4
- Node 2: 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): Node 0 has connections with Node 2. Since Node 0 has a lower label and fewer connections, we check for shared connections. The shared connection is Node 1, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (1, 2): Node 1 has connections with Node 2. Since Node 1 has a lower label and fewer connections, we check for shared connections. The shared connection is Node 0, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (1, 7): Node 1 has connections with Node 7. Since Node 1 has a lower label and fewer connections, we check for shared connections. The shared connection is Node 2, forming a triangle <1, 2, 7>.

Counting the total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 7>
