Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertex 9: Degree 4  
Vertex 7: Degree 4  
Vertex 3: Degree 1  
Vertex 2: Degree 2  
Vertex 4: Degree 4  
Vertex 6: Degree 4  
Vertex 5: Degree 4  
Vertex 0: Degree 4  
Vertex 1: Degree 5  
Vertex 8: Degree 4  

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph, the edges to consider in the order are:  
(3,0) (2,1) (6,2) (5,6) (7,5) (8,7) (9,8)  
Vertices 3 and 0 share a connection with vertex 1, forming triangle <0,1,3>.  
Vertices 2 and 1 share a connection with vertex 6, forming triangle <1,2,6>.  
Vertices 6 and 5 share a connection with vertex 1, forming triangle <1,5,6>.  
Vertices 5 and 7 share a connection with vertex 6, forming triangle <5,6,7>.  
Vertices 7 and 8 share a connection with vertex 5, forming triangle <5,7,8>.  
Vertices 8 and 9 share a connection with vertex 7, forming triangle <7,8,9>.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
