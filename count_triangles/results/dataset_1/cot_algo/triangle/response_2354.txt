Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each vertex:

- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 5
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 1
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 3

Now, we sort the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
Vertices by order: 5 -> 7 -> 0 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 9 -> 2

Next, we check the edges in the order they appear. We only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

1. Edge (0, 2): Both have 2 connections. No triangle formed.
2. Edge (0, 4): Both have 2 connections. No triangle formed.
3. Edge (2, 0): The lower label is 0 which has 2 connections. Possible triangle: <0, 2, 4>.
4. Edge (2, 5): The lower label is 2 which has 5 connections. No triangle formed.
5. Edge (2, 7): The lower label is 2 which has 5 connections. No triangle formed.
6. Edge (2, 8): The lower label is 2 which has 5 connections. No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 2): Both have 5 connections. No triangle formed.
8. Edge (4, 0): The lower label is 0 which has 2 connections. Possible triangle: <0, 2, 4>.
9. Edge (4, 6): The lower label is 4 which has 2 connections. Possible triangle: <0, 4, 6>.
10. Edge (6, 4): The lower label is 4 which has 2 connections. No triangle formed.
11. Edge (6, 9): The lower label is 6 which has 2 connections. No triangle formed.
12. Edge (7, 2): The lower label is 2 which has 5 connections. No triangle formed.
13. Edge (8, 2): The lower label is 2 which has 5 connections. No triangle formed.
14. Edge (8, 8): Both have 3 connections. No triangle formed.
15. Edge (9, 6): The lower label is 6 which has 2 connections. No triangle formed.
16. Edge (9, 8): The lower label is 8 which has 3 connections. No triangle formed.
