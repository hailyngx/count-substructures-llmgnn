Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph, we sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 9: 0 connections
Nodes 3, 4, 9: 1 connection each
Nodes 0, 2, 5: 2 connections each
Nodes 7, 9: 4 connections
Nodes 1, 6, 8: 5 connections

Next, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This means we will focus on edges involving vertices 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 

We look for triangles considering the shared connections between the vertices of each edge:

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
