Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we assign new labels to the vertices as follows:
- Node 0 has 1 connection
- Node 1 has 1 connection
- Node 5 has 1 connection
- Node 7 has 1 connection
- Node 9 has 1 connection
- Node 4 has 2 connections
- Node 8 has 3 connections
- Node 6 has 5 connections
- Node 2 has 5 connections
- Node 3 has 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the total number of triangles to be 6. 

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the output is [6].
