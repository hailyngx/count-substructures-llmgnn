Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the nodes based on their degree:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes in ascending order based on their degrees:

Node 0 (degree 1) becomes Node 0
Node 1 (degree 2) becomes Node 1
Node 5 (degree 3) becomes Node 2
Node 4 (degree 3) becomes Node 3
Node 7 (degree 2) becomes Node 4
Node 2 (degree 4) becomes Node 5
Node 3 (degree 4) becomes Node 6
Node 8 (degree 4) becomes Node 7
Node 6 (degree 3) becomes Node 8
Node 9 (degree 2) becomes Node 9

Next, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:

By following the degree-based ordering and considering lower-labeled vertices with fewer connections, we find:
- Node 0 doesn't form any triangles.
- Node 1 doesn't form any triangles.
- Node 2 forms a triangle with (2, 5, 7).
- Node 3 forms a triangle with (3, 4, 8).
- Node 4 doesn't form any triangles.
- Node 5 doesn't form any triangles.
- Node 6 forms a triangle with (6, 8, 9).
- Node 7 doesn't form any triangles.
- Node 8 doesn't form any triangles.
- Node 9 doesn't form any triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <6, 8, 9>.
