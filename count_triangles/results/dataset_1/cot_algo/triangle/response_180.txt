Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective connections:
0 (4 connections), 1 (1 connection), 3 (1 connection), 7 (2 connections), 5 (2 connections), 8 (2 connections), 4 (2 connections), 9 (3 connections), 6 (4 connections), 2 (4 connections).

We will now go through each edge and count the number of triangles by following the method described earlier:

1. Edge (0, 2): Check for shared connections with vertices 0 and 2. Shared connections: 3, 5, 8. Triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>.
2. Edge (0, 3): Check for shared connections with vertices 0 and 3. Shared connections: - (No triangles formed).
3. Edge (0, 5): Check for shared connections with vertices 0 and 5. Shared connections: 7. Triangles: <0, 5, 7>.
4. Edge (0, 8): Check for shared connections with vertices 0 and 8. Shared connections: 6, 6. Triangles: <0, 8, 6> (Counted only once).
5. Edge (1, 9): Since vertex 1 has the least connections, no triangles are formed.
6. Edge (2, 4): Check for shared connections with vertices 2 and 4. Shared connections: 6. Triangles: <2, 4, 6>.
7. Continuing similarly for the remaining edges, we find no additional triangles.
    
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 8, 6>, and <2, 4, 6>.
