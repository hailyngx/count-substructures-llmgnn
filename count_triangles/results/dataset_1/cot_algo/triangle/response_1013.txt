Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

- Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
Node 7 has 0 connections.
Nodes 6 and 9 have 1 connection.
Nodes 0, 1, 5 have 2 connections.
Nodes 8 has 3 connections.
Nodes 2 has 4 connections.
Nodes 3 and 4 have 6 connections.

Relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 7 -> Node 0
Node 6 -> Node 1
Node 9 -> Node 2
Node 0 -> Node 3
Node 1 -> Node 4
Node 5 -> Node 5
Node 8 -> Node 6
Node 2 -> Node 7
Node 3 -> Node 8
Node 4 -> Node 9

Considering the edges with the lower labeled vertices having fewer connections:

- Looking at the edges, we can now check for triangles by examining shared connections:
<3, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 3, 8>

This results in a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
