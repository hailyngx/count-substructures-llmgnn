Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

1. Vertex 3 has degree 1.
2. Vertices 6 and 7 have degree 1.
3. Vertices 1 and 8 have degree 2.
4. Vertices 5 and 6 have degree 2.
5. Vertices 2 and 7 have degree 3.

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 3 -> A (lowest degree)
Vertices 6, 7 -> B
Vertices 1, 8 -> C
Vertices 5 -> D
Vertices 2 -> E (highest degree)

Now, we will examine the edges, ensuring that we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (1, 2): Both vertices have the same degree. No triangle formed.
2. Edge (1, 7): A is connected to B. No triangle formed.
3. Edge (2, 6): B is connected to E. No triangle formed.
4. Edge (3, 8): A is connected to C. No triangle formed.
5. Edge (4, 5): D is connected to D. Triangle <4, 5, 9> formed.
6. Edge (4, 9): D is connected to C. No triangle formed.
7. Edge (5, 9): D is connected to C. No triangle formed.
8. Edge (8, 9): C is connected to D. No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1], and the unique triangle found is <4, 5, 9>.
