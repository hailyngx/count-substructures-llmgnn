Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling: 
Vertices: 0, 8, 4, 1, 5, 3, 7, 6, 2, 9

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph: 
1. Edge (0, 2) forms triangle with 2, 9
2. Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle
3. Edge (1, 2) forms triangle with 2, 7
4. Edge (1, 7) forms triangle with 1, 2
5. Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle
6. Edge (1, 9) forms triangle with 1, 2
7. Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle
8. Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle
9. Edge (2, 7) forms triangle with 1, 7
10. Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle
11. Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle
12. Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle
13. Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle
14. Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle
15. Edge (5, 6) forms triangle with 7, 6
16. Edge (5, 7) forms triangle with 1, 7
17. Edge (6, 9) forms triangle with 9, 3

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 9>.
