Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:

Sorted vertices by their number of connections:
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections
Therefore, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 3 -> 0
Node 5 -> 1
Node 6 -> 2
Node 8 -> 3
Node 9 -> 4
Node 1 -> 5
Node 5 -> 6
Node 2 -> 7
Node 7 -> 8
Node 4 -> 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

(0, 4): No triangles
(0, 7): No triangles
(0, 9): No triangles
(1, 2): No triangles
(1, 4): No triangles
(2, 1): No triangles
(2, 7): No triangles
(3, 4): No triangles
(4, 0): No triangles
(4, 1): No triangles
(4, 3): No triangles
(4, 8): No triangles
(5, 9): No triangles
(6, 7): No triangles
(7, 0): No triangles
(7, 2): No triangles
(7, 6): No triangles
(8, 4): No triangles
(9, 0): No triangles
(9, 5): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
