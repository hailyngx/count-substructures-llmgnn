Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles in the graph:
1. (1, 4): No triangles
2. (2, 4): No triangles
3. (2, 9): No triangles
4. (3, 4): No triangles
5. (3, 6): No triangles
6. (4, 1): No triangles
7. (4, 2): No triangles
8. (4, 3): No triangles
9. (4, 9): <2, 4, 9>
10. (5, 6): No triangles
11. (5, 7): No triangles
12. (6, 3): No triangles
13. (6, 5): No triangles
14. (6, 7): No triangles
15. (6, 9): <4, 6, 9>
16. (7, 5): No triangles
17. (7, 6): No triangles
18. (7, 8): No triangles
19. (8, 7): No triangles
20. (8, 9): No triangles
21. (9, 2): No triangles
22. (9, 4): <2, 4, 9>
23. (9, 6): <4, 6, 9>
24. (9, 8): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <2, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 9>.
