Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 4: 0 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles by examining the edges. 

There are a total of 11 triangles in the graph: 
\[10\]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <1, 7, 5>, <5, 7, 6>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 5>, <0, 9, 8>
