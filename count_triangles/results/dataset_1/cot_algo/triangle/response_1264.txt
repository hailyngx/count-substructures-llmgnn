Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, we have:

Vertices: 2, 5, 1, 7, 3, 6, 0, 4, 8, 9

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 6):
   - Vertex 0 has connections with 6, 9
   - Vertex 6 has connections with 0, 3, 4
   - Shared connections: 0, 9
   - Triangle: <0, 6, 9> 

2. Edge (0, 9):
   - Vertex 0 has connections with 6, 9
   - Vertex 9 has connections with 0, 4, 5, 7, 8
   - Shared connections: 0, 9
   - Triangle: <0, 6, 9>
   
3. Edge (1, 4):
   - Vertex 1 has connections with 4
   - Vertex 4 has connections with 1, 6, 8, 9
   - Shared connections: 1, 4
   - Triangle: <1, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [2]
