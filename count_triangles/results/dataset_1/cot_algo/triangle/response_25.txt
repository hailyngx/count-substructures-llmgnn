Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the new order of vertices is:
Vertex 1 (degree 2)
Vertex 5 (degree 2)
Vertex 4 (degree 2)
Vertex 3 (degree 3)
Vertex 7 (degree 3)
Vertex 0 (degree 5)
Vertex 2 (degree 5)
Vertex 6 (degree 6)
Vertex 8 (degree 7)
Vertex 9 (degree 4)

Now, examining the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections, we look at each edge:
(0, 6) forms triangles with 2 shared connections: 8, 9
(0, 8) does not form a triangle since 0 and 8 have common connections but do not form a triangle due to degree-based ordering.
(0, 9) does not form a triangle since 0 and 9 have common connections but do not form a triangle due to degree-based ordering.
(1, 3) does not form a triangle since 1 and 3 have common connections but do not form a triangle due to degree-based ordering.
(1, 5) does not form a triangle since 1 and 5 do not have any common connections.
(2, 6) forms triangles with 2 shared connections: 8, 9
(2, 8) does not form a triangle since 2 and 8 have common connections but do not form a triangle due to degree-based ordering.
(2, 9) does not form a triangle since 2 and 9 have common connections but do not form a triangle due to degree-based ordering.
(3, 1) does not form a triangle since 1 and 3 have common connections but do not form a triangle due to degree-based ordering.
(3, 6) forms a triangle with one shared connection: 8
(4, 8) does not form a triangle since 4 and 8 do not have any common connections.
(5, 1) does not form a triangle since 1 and 5 do not have common connections.
(6, 0) does not form a triangle since 0 and 6 have common connections but do not form a triangle due to degree-based ordering.
(6, 2) forms triangles with 2 shared connections: 8, 9
(6, 3) forms a triangle with one shared connection: 8
(8, 0) does not form a triangle since 0 and 8 have common connections but do not form a triangle due to degree-based ordering.
(8, 2) does not form a triangle since 2 and 8 have common connections but do not form a triangle due to degree-based ordering.
(8, 4) does not form a triangle since 4 and 8 do not have any common connections.
(8, 6) forms triangles with 2 shared connections: 0, 2
(8, 9) does not form a triangle since 8 and 9 have common connections but do not form a triangle due to degree-based ordering.
(9, 0) does not form a triangle since 0 and 9 have common connections but do not form a triangle due to degree-based ordering.
(9, 2) does not form a triangle since 2 and 9 have common connections but do not form a triangle due to degree-based ordering.
(9, 8) does not form a triangle since 8 and 9 have common connections but do not form a triangle due to degree-based ordering.

The total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
