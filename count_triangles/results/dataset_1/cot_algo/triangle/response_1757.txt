Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 5

Now, considering only the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections, we can find the triangles:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle 3: <0, 8, 6>
- Triangle 4: <0, 8, 5>
- Triangle 5: <1, 8, 5>
- Triangle 6: <1, 8, 6>
- Triangle 7: <2, 0, 9>
- Triangle 8: <2, 3, 0>
- Triangle 9: <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle 10: <2, 9, 6>
- Triangle 11: <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle 12: <3, 5, 8>
- Triangle 13: <3, 9, 4>
- Triangle 14: <3, 9, 6>
- Triangle 15: <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle 16: <5, 8, 6>
- Triangle 17: <6, 8, 9>
- Triangle 18: <6, 9, 7>
- Triangle 19: <6, 9, 4>
- Triangle 20: <7, 4, 9>
- Triangle 21: <9, 4, 7>

Therefore, there are 21 triangles in total. The list of unique triangles found is <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 8, 6>, <2, 0, 9>, <2, 3, 0>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 9, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 9, 4>, <3, 9, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 6>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 9, 4>, <7, 4, 9>, <9, 4, 7>.
