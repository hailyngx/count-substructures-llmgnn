Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes by their degree:

Node 2: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections

Now, let's count the triangles. We will start with edges involving nodes with the lowest degree.

Triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
