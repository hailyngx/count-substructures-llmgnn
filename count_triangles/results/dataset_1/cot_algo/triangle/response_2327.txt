Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  

Node 0 has 2 connections  
Node 1 has 1 connection  
Node 4 has 1 connection  
Node 7 has 2 connections  
Node 9 has 2 connections  
Node 2 has 3 connections  
Node 8 has 4 connections  
Node 5 has 5 connections  
Node 3 has 6 connections  
Node 6 has 6 connections  
  
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles by examining each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  
  
Count of triangles: [12]  
  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 5, 4>  
<0, 5, 6>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<1, 6, 5>  
<1, 6, 8>  
<1, 6, 2>  
<5, 6, 8>  
<5, 6, 2>  
<3, 5, 8>  
<3, 5, 6>  
<6, 8, 3>
