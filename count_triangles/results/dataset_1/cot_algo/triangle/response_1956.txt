Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most, the relabeling of the vertices is as follows:  

Node 5 has 0 connections.  
Node 7 has 1 connection.  
Nodes 1, 2, 6 have 2 connections.  
Nodes 0, 4 have 4 connections.  
Nodes 3, 9 have 5 connections.  
Node 8 has 7 connections.  

Now, we will go through each edge starting from the one with the lower label to count the triangles formed by shared connections.
