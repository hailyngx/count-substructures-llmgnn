Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to determine the number of connections each vertex has:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections

Now, we will sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertex 6 (1 connection)
Vertex 0, 1, 9 (2 connections)
Vertex 2, 5, 7, 8 (3 connections)
Vertex 3 (4 connections)
Vertex 4 (6 connections)

Next, we will check each edge starting from the lower labeled vertex and count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 4): Shared connections with 0 and 4 are 2 and 2, respectively. This forms a triangle with vertex 0. <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (1, 4): Shared connections with 1 and 4 are 2 and 2, respectively. This forms another triangle with vertex 1. <1, 2, 4>
- Edge (2, 3): Shared connections with 2 and 3 are 4 and 3, respectively. This forms a triangle with vertex 2. <0, 2, 3>
- Edge (3, 7): Shared connections with 3 and 7 are 3 and 3, respectively. This forms another triangle with vertex 3. <1, 3, 7>
- Edge (3, 8): Shared connections with 3 and 8 are 3 and 3, respectively. This forms another triangle with vertex 3. <1, 3, 8>
- Edge (3, 4): Shared connections with 3 and 4 are 3 and 6, respectively. This forms a triangle with vertex 3. <0, 3, 4>
- Edge (4, 6): Shared connections with 4 and 6 are 1 and 6, respectively. This forms a triangle with vertex 4. <0, 4, 6>

Count of triangles: 6
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
