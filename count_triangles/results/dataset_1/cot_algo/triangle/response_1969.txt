Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labeling of the nodes is as follows: 

Node 0 has 4 connections.  
Node 1 has 5 connections.  
Node 3 has 4 connections.  
Node 9 has 2 connections.  
Node 6 has 2 connections.  
Node 8 has 3 connections.  
Node 2 has 4 connections.  
Node 7 has 5 connections.  
Node 5 has 5 connections.  
Node 4 has 6 connections.  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 4>
