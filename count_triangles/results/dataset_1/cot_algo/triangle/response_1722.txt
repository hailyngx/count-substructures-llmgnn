Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
1. 5 connections: Node 0
2. 4 connections: Node 3, Node 9
3. 3 connections: Node 2, Node 6, Node 7
4. 2 connections: Node 1
5. 1 connection: Node 4, Node 8

Triangles found:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
