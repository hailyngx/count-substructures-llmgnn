Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree:

Nodes: 9, 1, 4, 7, 8, 5, 3, 6, 2, 0

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 6]

<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
