Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0 has degree 2.
Node 1 has degree 1.
Node 6 has degree 2.
Node 7 has degree 2.
Node 8 has degree 2.
Node 9 has degree 3.
Node 2 has degree 4.
Node 5 has degree 4.
Node 3 has degree 4.
Node 4 has degree 5.

Relabeling the nodes:
Node 1 (degree 1) -> label 0
Node 0 (degree 2) -> label 1
Node 6 (degree 2) -> label 2
Node 7 (degree 2) -> label 3
Node 8 (degree 2) -> label 4
Node 9 (degree 3) -> label 5
Node 2 (degree 4) -> label 6
Node 5 (degree 4) -> label 7
Node 3 (degree 4) -> label 8
Node 4 (degree 5) -> label 9

Checking the edges based on the labeling:
(0, 3): Node 0 and Node 8 -> share Node 6 -> Triangle <0, 6, 8>
(0, 9): Node 0 and Node 5 -> share Node 2 -> Triangle <0, 2, 5>
(1, 6): Not considered as Node 1 has lower degree than Node 6.
(2, 5): Not considered as Node 2 has higher degree than Node 5.
(2, 8): Node 2 and Node 4 -> share Node 9 -> Triangle <2, 4, 9>
(2, 9): Not considered as Node 2 has higher degree than Node 9.
(3, 4): Node 3 and Node 9 -> share Node 5 -> Triangle <3, 4, 5>
(3, 6): Node 3 and Node 2 -> share Node 0 -> Triangle <0, 2, 3>
(4, 5): Node 4 and Node 7 -> share Node 5 -> Triangle <4, 5, 7>
(4, 7): Node 4 and Node 3 -> share Node 5 -> Already counted in (4, 5).
(4, 8): Node 4 and Node 2 -> share Node 9 -> Already counted in (2, 8).
(5, 7): Not considered as Node 5 has higher degree than Node 7.
(5, 9): Node 5 and Node 2 -> share Node 9 -> Already counted in (2, 9).
(6, 1): Not considered as Node 6 has higher degree than Node 1.
(6, 3): Node 6 and Node 2 -> share Node 0 -> Already counted in (0, 6).
(7, 4): Not considered as Node 7 has lower degree than Node 4.
(7, 5): Not considered as Node 7 has lower degree than Node 5.
(8, 2): Not considered as Node 8 has lower degree than Node 2.
(8, 4): Not considered as Node 8 has lower degree than Node 4.
(9, 0): Not considered as Node 9 has higher degree than Node 0.
(9, 2): Not considered as Node 9 has higher degree than Node 2.
(9, 5): Not considered as Node 9 has higher degree than Node 5.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles: <0, 6, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 5>
