Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 9: 1 connection
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections

Next, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 9 (1 connection) -> Node 0
Node 2 (1 connection) -> Node 1
Node 3 (2 connections) -> Node 2
Node 4 (3 connections) -> Node 3
Node 7 (4 connections) -> Node 4
Node 5 (4 connections) -> Node 5
Node 0 (5 connections) -> Node 6
Node 1 (5 connections) -> Node 7

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the relabeled nodes:

Edges with lower-labeled vertex having fewer connections:
(0, 1) - Shared connections: 5
(0, 5) - Shared connections: 4
(0, 7) - Shared connections: 4
(1, 3) - Shared connections: None
(1, 4) - Shared connections: 3
(1, 5) - Shared connections: 4
(2, 4) - Shared connections: None
(3, 7) - Shared connections: 4

Counting the total number of triangles gives us [2].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 7> and <1, 3, 4>.
