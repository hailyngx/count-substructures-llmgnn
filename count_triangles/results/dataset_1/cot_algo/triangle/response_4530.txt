Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 5 - Degree 4
Vertex 7 - Degree 2
Vertex 8 - Degree 2
Vertex 0 - Degree 3
Vertex 6 - Degree 4
Vertex 2 - Degree 4
Vertex 4 - Degree 5
Vertex 1 - Degree 6
Vertex 3 - Degree 5
Vertex 9 - Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges involving vertices with lower labels having fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles and identify them:

Total number of triangles: [10]
Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
