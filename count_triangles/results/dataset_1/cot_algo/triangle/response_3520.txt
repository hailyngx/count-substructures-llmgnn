Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in this graph. To do this, we first determine the degree of each node:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 9: 3 connections

Vertices sorted by degree: 2, 1, 5, 0, 4, 9, 7, 3

Re-labeling: 
Node 2 -> 0
Node 1 -> 1
Node 5 -> 2
Node 0 -> 3
Node 4 -> 4
Node 9 -> 5
Node 7 -> 6
Node 3 -> 7

Now, examining the edges and counting the triangles:
- (0, 3) and (3, 0): <0, 3, 4>
- (0, 4) and (4, 0): <0, 3, 4>
- (0, 7) and (7, 0): <0, 3, 7>
- (1, 3) and (3, 1): <1, 3, 7>
- (1, 5) and (5, 1): <1, 3, 5>
- (2, 3) and (3, 2): <0, 2, 3>
- (3, 4) and (4, 3): <0, 3, 4>
- (3, 7) and (7, 3): <0, 3, 7>
- (3, 9) and (9, 3): <0, 3, 5>
- (4, 5) and (5, 4): <1, 3, 5>
- (7, 9), (9, 7), and (7, 3): <0, 6, 5>
- (7, 9), (9, 7), and (9, 3): <0, 6, 5>

Total number of triangles: [10]
