Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After analyzing the edges, we find the following triangles:
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 7, 5>
<2, 3, 0>
<2, 8, 6>
<7, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
