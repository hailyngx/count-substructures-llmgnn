Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex numbering is as follows: 
Node 9 (Degree 1) -> Node 5 (Degree 1) -> Node 8 (Degree 2) -> Node 6 (Degree 2) -> Node 3 (Degree 2) -> Node 4 (Degree 3) -> Node 1 (Degree 4) -> Node 2 (Degree 5) -> Node 7 (Degree 5) -> Node 0 (Degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. Node 9 - Node 0: No triangles
2. Node 5 - Node 9: No triangles
3. Node 8 - Node 4: No triangles
4. Node 6 - Node 4: No triangles
5. Node 3 - Node 0: No triangles
6. Node 4 - Node 6: No triangles
7. Node 1 - Node 0: Triangle <0, 1, 2>
8. Node 2 - Node 1: Triangle <0, 1, 2>
9. Node 2 - Node 7: No triangles
10. Node 7 - Node 0: Triangle <0, 1, 7>, Triangle <0, 2, 7>, Triangle <1, 2, 7>
11. Node 7 - Node 1: Triangle <0, 1, 7>, Triangle <1, 2, 7>
12. Node 7 - Node 2: Triangle <0, 2, 7>, Triangle <1, 2, 7>
13. Node 7 - Node 4: No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 7>.
