Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The vertices and their connections are as follows after sorting by number of connections:

- Vertex 0: 3, 5, 7
- Vertex 1: 4, 5, 9
- Vertex 2: 3, 5
- Vertex 3: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Vertex 4: 1, 6, 7
- Vertex 5: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Vertex 6: 3, 4
- Vertex 7: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Vertex 8: 7
- Vertex 9: 1

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 5. Triangle: <0, 3, 5>
- Edge (0, 5): Forms triangles with vertices 1 and 2. Triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (0, 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 3. Triangle: <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (1, 4): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (1, 9): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (2, 3): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (2, 5): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 0): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 2): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 5): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 6): Forms a triangle with vertex 4. Triangle: <3, 4, 6>
- Edge (3, 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (4, 1): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle with vertex 3. Triangle: <3, 4, 6>
- Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <0, 4, 7>
- Edge (5, 0): Forms a triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (5, 1): Forms a triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (5, 2): Forms triangles with vertices 0 and 3. Triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 5>
- Edge (5, 3): Forms triangles with vertices 0 and 2. Triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 5>
- Edge (6, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 4. Triangle: <3, 4, 6>
- Edge (6, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 3. Triangle: <3, 4, 6>
- Edge (7, 0): Forms a triangle with vertex 3. Triangle: <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (7, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (7, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <0, 4, 7>
- Edge (7, 8): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (8, 7): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 1): Does not form any triangles.
