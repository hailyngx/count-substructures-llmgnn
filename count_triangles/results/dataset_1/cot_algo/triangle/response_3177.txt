Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to find the degree of each vertex based on the given edges:

- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 3
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 5
- Vertex 9: degree 3

Now, we need to relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:

- Vertex 0 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 7 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 3 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 4 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 5 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 9 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 1 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 6 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 8 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 8

Now, we need to list the edges in the new labeling:

- Edges: (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4)

We will now count the triangles formed by these edges. The triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, and <3, 4, 5>. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
