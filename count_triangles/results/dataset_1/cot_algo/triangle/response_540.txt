Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
(4 connections) - 0
(2 connections) - 1, 4, 8, 9
(3 connections) - 3, 7
(4 connections) - 2, 5, 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles:

- For edge (0, 2):
  - Both vertices have 4 connections, so we proceed.
  - Shared connections: 5
  - Triangle: <0, 2, 5>

- For edge (0, 5):
  - Vertex 0 has 4 connections, while vertex 5 has 3 connections. We proceed.
  - Shared connections: 3
  - Triangle: <0, 5, 3>

- For edge (1, 3):
  - Both vertices have 2 connections, so we proceed.
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (1, 8):
  - Both vertices have 2 connections, so we proceed.
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (2, 3):
  - Vertex 2 has 4 connections, while vertex 3 has 3 connections. We proceed.
  - Shared connections: 0, 5
  - Triangle: <2, 3, 0>, <2, 3, 5>

- For edge (2, 9):
  - Vertex 2 has 4 connections, while vertex 9 has 2 connections. We proceed.
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (3, 1):
  - Vertex 3 has 3 connections, while vertex 1 has 2 connections. We proceed.
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (3, 5):
  - Both vertices have 3 connections, so we proceed.
  - Shared connections: 0
  - Triangle: <3, 5, 0>

- For edge (4, 6):
  - Both vertices have 2 connections, so we proceed.
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (5, 7):
  - Vertex 5 has 3 connections, while vertex 7 has 2 connections. We proceed.
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (6, 8):
  - Both vertices have 2 connections, so we proceed.
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (7, 9):
  - Both vertices have 2 connections, so we proceed.
  - Shared connections: None

Based on the above analysis, the total number of triangles is [6].
Unique triangles found: 
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 3>, <2, 3, 0>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 0>, <4, 6, 8>
