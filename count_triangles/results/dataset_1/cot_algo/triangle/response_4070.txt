Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on their number of connections:

Vertices: 2, 5, 6, 8, 0, 4, 9, 1, 7, 3

Now, we will count the number of triangles by examining each edge:

Edge (0, 3):
- Both vertices have 3 connections: 9, 2, 4
- Triangle: <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle: <0, 3, 2>
- Triangle: <0, 3, 4>

Edge (0, 9):
- Both vertices have 3 connections: 3, 1, 7
- Triangle: <0, 9, 3>
- Triangle: <0, 9, 1>
- Triangle: <0, 9, 7>

Edge (1, 5):
- Both vertices have 2 connections: 6, 7
- No triangles formed.

Edge (1, 7):
- Vertex 1 has 3 connections while vertex 7 has 4 connections.
- Triangle: <1, 7, 3>
- Triangle: <1, 7, 4>

Edge (1, 9):
- Both vertices have 3 connections: 0, 3, 7
- No new triangles formed.

Edge (2, 3):
- Vertex 2 has 2 connections while vertex 3 has 4 connections.
- No new triangles formed.

- Triangle: <3, 7, 1>
- Triangle: <3, 7, 4>
- Triangle: <3, 7, 0>
- Triangle: <3, 7, 9>

Edge (3, 8):
- Vertex 3 has 4 connections while vertex 8 has 2 connections.
- No new triangles formed.

- Triangle: <4, 7, 1>
- Triangle: <4, 7, 3>
- Triangle: <4, 7, 6>
- Triangle: <4, 7, 9>

Edge (5, 1):
