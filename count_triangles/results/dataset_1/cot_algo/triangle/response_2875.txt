Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:

- Node 1: degree = 4
- Node 2: degree = 1
- Node 3: degree = 7
- Node 4: degree = 1
- Node 5: degree = 2
- Node 6: degree = 4
- Node 7: degree = 3
- Node 8: degree = 2
- Node 9: degree = 3
- Node 10: degree = 0

Next, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 10 (degree = 0) --> New label: 1
- Node 2 (degree = 1) --> New label: 2
- Node 4 (degree = 1) --> New label: 3
- Node 5 (degree = 2) --> New label: 4
- Node 8 (degree = 2) --> New label: 5
- Node 9 (degree = 3) --> New label: 6
- Node 7 (degree = 3) --> New label: 7
- Node 6 (degree = 4) --> New label: 8
- Node 1 (degree = 4) --> New label: 9
- Node 3 (degree = 7) --> New label: 10

Now, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles:

Triangles:
- <6, 1, 9>
- <6, 1, 4>
- <6, 1, 3>
- <6, 1, 9>
- <6, 9, 8>
- <6, 8, 3>
- <6, 8, 7>
- <6, 1, 4>
- <6, 4, 3>
- <6, 3, 10>
- <6, 3, 7>
- <6, 3, 8>
- <8, 6, 7>
- <8, 6, 3>
- <8, 6, 1>
- <8, 6, 9>
- <8, 3, 10>
- <7, 6, 1>
- <7, 6, 3>
- <1, 6, 4>
- <1, 6, 3>
- <4, 6, 3>

Total number of triangles: [22]
