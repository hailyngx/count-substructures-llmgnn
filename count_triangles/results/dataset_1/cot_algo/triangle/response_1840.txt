Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Nodes: 0, 3, 5, 9
Degree 1: 0, 3, 5, 9
Nodes: 6
Degree 2: 6
Nodes: 2
Degree 3: 2
Nodes: 4, 8
Degree 4: 4, 8
Nodes: 1, 7
Degree 5: 1, 7

Now, we will count the triangles by looking at each edge starting from the vertices with lower degrees.

Triangles:
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
