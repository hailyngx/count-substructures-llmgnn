Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
Vertices: 1, 9, 3, 4, 5, 9, 0, 2, 8, 7

Now, let's relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 1 ⟶ 0
Vertex 9 ⟶ 1
Vertex 3 ⟶ 2
Vertex 4 ⟶ 3
Vertex 5 ⟶ 4
Vertex 9 ⟶ 1
Vertex 0 ⟶ 5
Vertex 2 ⟶ 6
Vertex 8 ⟶ 7
Vertex 7 ⟶ 8

Now, let's check the edges based on the relabeled vertices:

Edges:
(5, 6) (5, 0) (0, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (1, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by the edges:

Triangles: 
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
