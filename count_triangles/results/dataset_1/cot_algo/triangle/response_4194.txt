Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
- Node 0: 6 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 9: 1 connection

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
- Node 9 (1 connection)
- Node 5 (2 connections)
- Node 1 (3 connections)
- Node 6 (3 connections)
- Node 7 (3 connections)
- Node 2 (4 connections)
- Node 4 (4 connections)
- Node 3 (5 connections)
- Node 0 (6 connections)
- Node 8 (5 connections)

Next, we will count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method:

1. Considering edge (0, 1): Both nodes have 3 common connections (nodes 2, 3, 8). Therefore, we have one triangle <0, 1, 2>.
2. Considering edge (0, 2): Both nodes have 3 common connections (nodes 1, 3, 8). Therefore, we have one triangle <0, 2, 1>.
3. Considering edge (0, 3): Both nodes have 4 common connections (nodes 1, 2, 4, 8). Therefore, we have one triangle <0, 3, 1>.
4. Considering edge (0, 4): Both nodes have 2 common connections (nodes 3, 6). Therefore, we have one triangle <0, 4, 3>.
5. Considering edge (0, 6): Both nodes have 1 common connection (node 4). Therefore, we have one triangle <0, 6, 4>.
6. Considering edge (0, 8): Both nodes have 3 common connections (nodes 1, 2, 3). Therefore, we have one triangle <0, 8, 1>.
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
