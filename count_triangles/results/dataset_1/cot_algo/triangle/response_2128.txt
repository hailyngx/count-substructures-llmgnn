Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the nodes by their degree:

0 - degree 3  
1 - degree 3  
2 - degree 4  
3 - degree 2  
4 - degree 7  
5 - degree 2  
6 - degree 4  
7 - degree 3  
8 - degree 2  
9 - degree 1  

Next, we will analyze each edge considering the lower degree node first:
