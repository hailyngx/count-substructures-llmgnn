Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degree, the new node labels are:
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 6
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3

Now, we only consider edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
(0, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 6
(0, 5) forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 3
(0, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 5
(0, 8) does not form a triangle
(0, 9) does not form a triangle
(1, 3) does not form a triangle
(1, 4) does not form a triangle
(1, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5
(1, 7) does not form a triangle
(1, 8) does not form a triangle
(2, 3) does not form a triangle
(2, 4) does not form a triangle
(3, 4) does not form a triangle
(3, 5) does not form a triangle
(3, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5
(4, 1) does not form a triangle
(4, 2) does not form a triangle
(4, 3) does not form a triangle
(5, 0) does not form a triangle
(5, 3) does not form a triangle
(5, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 3
(6, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 5
(6, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5
(6, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5
(6, 7) does not form a triangle
(7, 1) does not form a triangle
(7, 6) does not form a triangle
(8, 0) does not form a triangle
(8, 1) does not form a triangle
(8, 9) does not form a triangle
(9, 0) does not form a triangle
(9, 8) does not form a triangle

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<0, 1, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
