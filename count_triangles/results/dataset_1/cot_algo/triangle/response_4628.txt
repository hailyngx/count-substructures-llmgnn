Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degrees from least to most connected:
Nodes: 3, 5, 8, 7, 0, 1, 6, 2, 9, 4

Next, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
3 → 0, 5 → 1, 8 → 2, 7 → 3, 0 → 4, 1 → 5, 6 → 6, 2 → 7, 9 → 8, 4 → 9

Now, we will check each edge based on their labels and count the triangles:
Triangles: [3]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
