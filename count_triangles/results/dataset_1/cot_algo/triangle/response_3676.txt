Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Nodes 4 and 7 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 1, 2, 8 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 6 and 9 have 4 connections each.
Node 3 has 5 connections.
And node 0 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles in the graph.

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 6>
