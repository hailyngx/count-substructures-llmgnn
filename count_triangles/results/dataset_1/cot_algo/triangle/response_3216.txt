Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are as follows:
Node 3: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5

Calculating the triangles:
- Looking at the edges starting from the lowest degree nodes:
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<9, 0, 1>
<9, 0, 8>
<9, 0, 1>
<9, 0, 8>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 2, 7>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 2, 7>
<7, 3, 5>
<7, 3, 8>
<7, 3, 5>
<7, 3, 8>
<5, 1, 6>
<5, 1, 3>
<5, 1, 6>
<5, 1, 3>
<6, 2, 4>
<6, 2, 8>
<6, 2, 4>
<6, 2, 8>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [13].
