Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the new vertices are:  
Vertex 0 connects to: 1 2 5 7 (degree 4)  
Vertex 1 connects to: 0 4 6 8 9 (degree 5)  
Vertex 2 connects to: 0 (degree 1)  
Vertex 3 connects to: 5 9 (degree 2)  
Vertex 4 connects to: 1 6 7 8 (degree 4)  
Vertex 5 connects to: 0 3 6 (degree 3)  
Vertex 6 connects to: 1 4 5 9 (degree 4)  
Vertex 7 connects to: 0 4 9 (degree 3)  
Vertex 8 connects to: 1 4 (degree 2)  
Vertex 9 connects to: 1 3 6 7 (degree 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles: 

Triangles found: 
<0, 1, 4> 
<0, 1, 6> 
<0, 1, 7> 
<0, 2, 5> 
<1, 4, 6> 
<1, 4, 7> 
<1, 4, 9> 
<3, 5, 9> 
<4, 6, 9> 
<6, 7, 9> 

Total number of triangles: [10]
