Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
Node 0: degree 1
Node 4: degree 1
Node 6: degree 1
Node 7: degree 1
Node 9: degree 1
Node 3: degree 2
Node 1: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 6
Node 5: degree 7

Calculating the number of triangles:
- Node 0 forms triangles with node 5.
- Node 4 forms triangles with node 8.
- Node 6 forms triangles with node 2.
- Node 7 forms triangles with node 5.
- Node 9 forms triangles with node 1.
- Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 2 forms a triangle with node 5.
- Node 5 doesn't form any additional triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 2>, <4, 8, 5>, <6, 2, 1>, <7, 5, 0>, <9, 1, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <3, 5, 8>, <1, 8, 5>.
