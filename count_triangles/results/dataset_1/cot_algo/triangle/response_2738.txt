Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the vertices based on their degree:

0: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
8: 3 connections
6: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
7: 5 connections
9: 6 connections

Now, we will examine each edge and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 4):
   - Vertex 0 and 4 share a connection with vertex 2, forming the triangle <0, 2, 4>.

2. Edge (0, 9):
   - Vertex 0 and 9 share connections with vertices 2 and 4, forming the triangles <0, 2, 9> and <0, 4, 9>.

3. Edge (1, 3):
   - No triangles are formed.

4. Edge (1, 7):
   - No triangles are formed.

5. Edge (2, 4):
   - No triangles are formed.

6. Edge (2, 9):
   - No triangles are formed.

7. Edge (3, 1):
   - No triangles are formed.

8. Edge (3, 7):
   - Vertex 3 and 7 share a connection with vertex 5, forming the triangle <3, 5, 7>.

9. Edge (3, 8):
   - Vertex 3 and 8 share a connection with vertex 6, forming the triangle <3, 6, 8>.

10. Edge (4, 0):
   - No triangles are formed.

11. Edge (4, 2):
   - No triangles are formed.

12. Edge (5, 6):
   - No triangles are formed.

13. Edge (5, 7):
   - Vertex 5 and 7 share a connection with vertex 3, forming the triangle <3, 5, 7>.

14. Edge (6, 5):
   - No triangles are formed.

15. Edge (6, 8):
   - No triangles are formed.

16. Edge (6, 9):
   - Vertex 6 and 9 share connections with vertices 3 and 8, forming the triangles <6, 3, 8> and <6, 8, 9>.

17. Edge (7, 1):
   - No triangles are formed.

18. Edge (7, 3):
   - Vertex 7 and 3 share a connection with vertex 5, forming the triangle <3, 5, 7>.

19. Edge (7, 5):
   - Vertex 7 and 5 share a connection with vertex 3, forming the triangle <3, 5, 7>.

20. Edge (7, 9):
   - Vertex 7 and 9 share connections with vertices 3 and 8, forming the triangles <7, 3, 8> and <7, 8, 9>.

21. Edge (8, 3):
   - Vertex 8 and 3 share a connection with vertex 6, forming the triangle <3, 6, 8>.

22. Edge (8, 6):
   - No triangles are formed.

23. Edge (8, 9):
   - No triangles are formed.

24. Edge (9, 0):
   - No triangles are formed.

25. Edge (9, 2):
   - No triangles are formed.

26. Edge (9, 6):
   - No triangles are formed.

27. Edge (9, 7):
   - Vertex 9 and 7 share connections with vertices 3 and 8, forming the triangles <9, 3, 8> and <9, 7, 8>.

28. Edge (9, 8):
   - No triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9] inside brackets. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <6, 3, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 3, 8>, and <7, 8, 9> each listed inside <> once.
