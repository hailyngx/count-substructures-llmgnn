Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

By sorting the nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following list of vertices with their labels:
Node 3: 1
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 4
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 6
Node 0: 7
Node 4: 8
Node 9: 9
Node 8: 10

Next, we examine the edges based on the labels of the nodes:
Edge (0, 3):
Node 0 is labeled 7, Node 3 is labeled 1. Since Node 0 has a higher label than Node 3, we proceed.

Edge (0, 6):
Node 0 is labeled 7, Node 6 is labeled 3. Since Node 0 has a higher label than Node 6, we proceed.

Edge (1, 2):
Node 1 is labeled 5, Node 2 is labeled 6. Since Node 1 has a lower label than Node 2, we skip this edge.

Edge (1, 7):
Node 1 is labeled 5, Node 7 is labeled 4. Since Node 1 has a lower label than Node 7, we proceed.
This edge forms a triangle: <1, 5, 7>.

Edge (2, 1):
This edge was skipped previously due to the node ordering.

Edge (2, 9):
This edge was skipped previously due to the node ordering.

Edge (3, 0):
Node 3 is labeled 1, Node 0 is labeled 7. Since Node 3 has a lower label than Node 0, we skip this edge.

Edge (4, 8):
Node 4 is labeled 8, Node 8 is labeled 10. Since Node 4 has a lower label than Node 8, we proceed.

Edge (4, 9):
Node 4 is labeled 8, Node 9 is labeled 9. Since Node 4 has a lower label than Node 9, we skip this edge.

Edge (5, 8):
Node 5 is labeled 2, Node 8 is labeled 10. Since Node 5 has a lower label than Node 8, we skip this edge.

Edge (6, 0):
Node 6 is labeled 3, Node 0 is labeled 7. Since Node 6 has a lower label than Node 0, we skip this edge.

Edge (7, 1):
This edge was skipped previously due to the node ordering.

Edge (8, 4):
This edge was skipped previously due to the node ordering.

Edge (8, 5):
Node 8 is labeled 10, Node 5 is labeled 2. Since Node 8 has a higher label than Node 5, we proceed.

Edge (8, 9):
Node 8 is labeled 10, Node 9 is labeled 9. Since Node 8 has a higher label than Node 9, we proceed.
This edge forms a triangle: <8, 9, 10>.

Edge (9, 2):
This edge was skipped previously due to the node ordering.

Edge (9, 4):
This edge was skipped previously due to the node ordering.

Edge (9, 8):
This edge was skipped previously due to the node ordering.

The total number of triangles in the graph is 2, and they are as follows:
[<1, 5, 7>, <8, 9, 10>].
