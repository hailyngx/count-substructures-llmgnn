Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted vertices are: 
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 0: degree 5
Vertex 7: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 6
Vertex 5: degree 8
Vertex 9: degree 8

The edges that meet the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections" are:
(0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 9)
(1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 9)
(3, 8), (3, 9)
(4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)
(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9)
(6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9)
(7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)
(8, 3), (8, 4)
(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Triangles (0, 1, 5) and (0, 4, 5) are formed in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 5> <0, 4, 5>.
