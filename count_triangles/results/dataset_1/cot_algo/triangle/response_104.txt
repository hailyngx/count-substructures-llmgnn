Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding degrees are:
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 5
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 5
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 6
- Vertex 9: degree 2

The degree-based ordering is: 2, 4, 6, 7, 3, 5, 0, 8, 1, 9

With this ordering, we examine the edges to count the triangles:
1. Edge (2, 5) - Ignored as vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 5.
2. Edge (4, 5) - Ignored as vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 5.
3. Edge (6, 7) - Ignored as vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 7.
4. Edge (6, 9) - Ignored as vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 9.

After examining all edges, we find the number of triangles to be 2 and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 8>, and <1, 3, 7>.

Therefore, the output is:
