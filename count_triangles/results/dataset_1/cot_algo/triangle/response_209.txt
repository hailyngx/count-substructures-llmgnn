Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the relabeling is as follows:
Node 0: 1 connections
Node 5: 1 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

- For edge (0, 2):
  Node 0 has 1 connection and node 2 has 5 connections. Checking shared connections, we find the triangle <0, 2, 3>.

- For edge (1, 4):
  Node 1 has 4 connections and node 4 has 2 connections. Checking shared connections, we find the triangle <1, 4, 3>.

- For edge (1, 6):
  Node 1 has 4 connections and node 6 has 3 connections. Checking shared connections, we find the triangle <1, 6, 7>.

- For edge (1, 8):
  Node 1 has 4 connections and node 8 has 6 connections. Checking shared connections, we find the triangle <1, 8, 3>.

- For edge (2, 0):
  This has already been counted with edge (0, 2).

- For edge (2, 3):
  Node 2 has 5 connections and node 3 has 4 connections. Checking shared connections, we find the triangle <2, 3, 4>.

- For edge (2, 5):
  Node 2 has 5 connections and node 5 has 1 connection. There are no triangles formed here.

- For edge (3, 2):
  This has already been counted with edge (2, 3).

- For edge (3, 4):
  This edge forms a triangle with edge (1, 4), which has already been counted.

- For edge (3, 8):
  Node 3 has 4 connections and node 8 has 6 connections. Checking shared connections, we find the triangle <3, 8, 1>.

- For edge (4, 1):
  This edge forms a triangle with edge (1, 4), which has already been counted.

- For edge (4, 3):
  This has already been counted with edge (3, 4).

- For edge (5, 2):
  This edge has already been checked.

- For edge (6, 1):
  This edge has already been checked.

- For edge (6, 7):
  Node 6 has 3 connections and node 7 has 2 connections. Checking shared connections, we find the triangle <6, 7, 8>.

- For edge (6, 8):
  This edge forms a triangle with edge (1, 8), which has already been counted.

- For edge (7, 6):
  This edge has already been checked.

- For edge (7, 8):
  This edge forms a triangle with edge (1, 8), which has already been counted.

- For edge (8, 1):
  This edge has already been checked.

- For edge (8, 3):
  This edge forms a triangle with edge (3, 8), which has already been counted.

- For edge (8, 6):
  This edge forms a triangle with edge (1, 6), which has already been counted.

- For edge (8, 7):
  This edge has already been checked.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 8, 3>, <2, 3, 4>.
