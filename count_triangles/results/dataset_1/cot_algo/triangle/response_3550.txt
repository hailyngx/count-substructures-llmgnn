Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes sorted by degree:
1. node 1 - 1 connection
2. node 3 - 1 connection
3. node 4 - 1 connection
4. node 7 - 2 connections
5. node 8 - 4 connections
6. node 6 - 4 connections
7. node 2 - 4 connections
8. node 5 - 5 connections
9. node 9 - 6 connections
10. node 0 - 6 connections

Now we will relabel the nodes based on their degree ordering:
- node 1 -> node 0
- node 3 -> node 1
- node 4 -> node 2
- node 7 -> node 3
- node 8 -> node 4
- node 6 -> node 5
- node 2 -> node 6
- node 5 -> node 7
- node 9 -> node 8
- node 0 -> node 9

Next, we will go through the edges while following the lower label rule and count the triangles:

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <0, 6, 8>
5. <2, 7, 9>
6. <5, 6, 8>
7. <5, 8, 9>
8. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
