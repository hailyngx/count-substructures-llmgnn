Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 6: Degree 0
Node 7: Degree 0
Node 1: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles and list them:
Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <5, 9, 6>, <9, 3, 5>
