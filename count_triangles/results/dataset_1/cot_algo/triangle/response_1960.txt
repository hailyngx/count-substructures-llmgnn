Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle 3: <1, 8, 5>
- Triangle 4: <1, 9, 6>
- Triangle 5: <2, 0, 6>
- Triangle 6: <2, 4, 0>
- Triangle 7: <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle 8: <6, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
