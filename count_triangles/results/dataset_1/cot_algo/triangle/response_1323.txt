Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Node 1 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 2 and 9 have 2 connections.
- Nodes 3, 7, and 8 have 3 connections.
- Nodes 4 and 5 have 4 connections.
- Node 0 (with 5 connections) and Node 6 (with 6 connections) are the most connected nodes.

Using the edge list provided and the information above, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <4, 0, 5>
2. Triangle <5, 0, 7>
3. Triangle <5, 0, 9>
4. Triangle <6, 1, 2>
5. Triangle <6, 2, 8>
6. Triangle <6, 3, 8>
7. Triangle <6, 7, 0>
8. Triangle <8, 2, 3>
9. Triangle <8, 3, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles: [9]
