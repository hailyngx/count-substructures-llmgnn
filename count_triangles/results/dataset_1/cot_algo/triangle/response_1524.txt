Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are as follows:
- Node 2 with 2 connections
- Node 1 with 2 connections
- Node 7 with 3 connections
- Node 6 with 3 connections
- Node 9 with 4 connections
- Node 8 with 5 connections
- Node 5 with 5 connections
- Node 4 with 6 connections
- Node 3 with 6 connections
- Node 0 with 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we find the following:
- Triangles involving vertex 2: None
- Triangles involving vertex 1: None
- Triangles involving vertex 7: <5, 7, 8>
- Triangles involving vertex 6: <2, 3, 6> <5, 6, 7>
- Triangles involving vertex 9: <0, 4, 9> <0, 5, 9>
- Triangles involving vertex 8: <5, 6, 8> <5, 7, 8>
- Triangles involving vertex 5: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangles involving vertex 4: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangles involving vertex 3: <2, 3, 6> <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
