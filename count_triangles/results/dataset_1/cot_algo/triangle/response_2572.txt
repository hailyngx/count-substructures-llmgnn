Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices by degree (in ascending order):
0: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
3: 2 connections
6: 1 connection
7: 1 connection
8: 1 connection
4: 0 connections
5: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
2: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
3 -> 2
6 -> 3
7 -> 4
8 -> 5
4 -> 6
5 -> 7
9 -> 8
2 -> 9

Checking edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 2) forms a triangle with 9: <0, 2, 9>
(0, 9) forms a triangle with 2: <0, 9, 2>
(1, 2) does not form a triangle
(1, 6) does not form a triangle
(1, 9) forms a triangle with 0: <1, 9, 0>
(2, 0) does not form a triangle
(2, 1) does not form a triangle
(2, 5) does not form a triangle
(2, 8) does not form a triangle
(3, 5) does not form a triangle
(3, 7) does not form a triangle
(5, 2) does not form a triangle
(5, 3) does not form a triangle
(5, 9) forms a triangle with 0: <5, 9, 0>
(6, 1) does not form a triangle
(7, 3) does not form a triangle
(8, 2) does not form a triangle
(9, 0) does not form a triangle
(9, 1) does not form a triangle
(9, 5) does not form a triangle

Total number of triangles found: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 2, 9>, <0, 9, 2>
