Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections), the vertices can be relabeled as follows:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering approach, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Checking vertices 0 and 2: shared connection with vertex 5
Checking vertices 0 and 5: shared connections with vertices 2 and 7
Checking vertices 0 and 7: shared connections with vertices 5 and 1
Checking vertices 1 and 5: shared connections with vertices 0, 7, and 8
Checking vertices 1 and 7: shared connections with vertices 0, 5, 8, and 4
Checking vertices 1 and 8: shared connection with vertex 5
Checking vertices 4 and 7: no shared connection
Checking vertices 5 and 9: shared connection with vertex 7

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 9>.
