Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following labels:
- Node 9 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 3, 7 have 2 connections.
- Nodes 5, 6 have 3 connections.
- Nodes 2, 4, 8 have 4 connections.
- Node 1 has 5 connections.
- Node 0 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges in the following order:
(9, 8), (9, 8), (3, 5), (3, 1), (7, 5), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 8), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 1), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 1), (4, 0), (2, 8), (2, 5), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 2), (8, 0), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 0), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 4), (0, 2), (0, 1)

By examining the shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<8, 6, 5>, <3, 1, 7>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 0, 1>, <2, 5, 8>, <0, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
