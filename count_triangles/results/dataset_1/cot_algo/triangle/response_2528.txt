Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

- Node 3: Degree 2
- Node 7: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 5
- Node 1: Degree 6
- Node 4: Degree 6
- Node 0: Degree 7

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

- Node 3: Label 1
- Node 7: Label 2
- Node 8: Label 3
- Node 6: Label 4
- Node 9: Label 5
- Node 2: Label 6
- Node 5: Label 7
- Node 1: Label 8
- Node 4: Label 9
- Node 0: Label 10

Next, we will check each edge using the lower labeled vertex:

- Edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle with 5: <0, 4, 5>
- Edge (0, 5): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (0, 7): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (0, 8): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (1, 2): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle with 0: <1, 5, 0>
- Edge (1, 6): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (1, 7): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (1, 8): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (1, 9): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (2, 1): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (2, 5): Forms a triangle with 0: <2, 5, 0>
- Edge (2, 9): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (3, 6): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (3, 7): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (4, 0): Forms a triangle with 5: <4, 0, 5>
- Edge (4, 6): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (4, 9): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 0): Forms a triangle with 4: <5, 0, 4>
- Edge (5, 1): Forms a triangle with 0: <5, 1, 0>
- Edge (5, 2): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (6, 1): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (6, 3): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (6, 4): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (7, 0): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (7, 1): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (7, 3): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (7, 8): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 0): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 1): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 7): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 1): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 2): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 4): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 5): Does not form a triangle

Finally, we count the total number of triangles: [3]
