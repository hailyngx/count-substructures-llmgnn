Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  
1. 5 connections: 3  
2. 4 connections: 2, 9  
3. 3 connections: 0, 4, 6, 7  
4. 1 connection: 1, 8

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

Considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge: (1, 3) 
    - Check shared connections for vertices 1 and 3: 3 
    - Triangle found: <1, 3, 2>

- Edge: (1, 3) 
    - Check shared connections for vertices 1 and 3: 3 
    - Triangle found: <1, 3, 6>

- Edge: (2, 3) 
    - Check shared connections for vertices 2 and 3: None 

- Edge: (2, 4) 
    - Check shared connections for vertices 2 and 4: None 

- Edge: (2, 7) 
    - Check shared connections for vertices 2 and 7: None 

- Edge: (2, 9) 
    - Check shared connections for vertices 2 and 9: 3 
    - Triangle found: <2, 9, 3>

- Edge: (3, 1) 
    - Check shared connections for vertices 3 and 1: 3
    - Triangle found: <3, 1, 2>

- Edge: (3, 6) 
    - Check shared connections for vertices 3 and 6: None 

- Edge: (4, 2) 
    - Check shared connections for vertices 4 and 2: None 

- Edge: (4, 9) 
    - Check shared connections for vertices 4 and 9: 2 
    - Triangle found: <4, 9, 2>
