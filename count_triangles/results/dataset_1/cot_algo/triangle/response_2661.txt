Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 0 (degree 4)  
Vertex 1 (degree 2)  
Vertex 2 (degree 6)  
Vertex 3 (degree 3)  
Vertex 4 (degree 1)  
Vertex 5 (degree 1)  
Vertex 6 (degree 3)  
Vertex 7 (degree 1)  
Vertex 8 (degree 1)  
Vertex 9 (degree 5)  

Now, looking at each edge in the graph based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Analyzing edge (0, 1): No triangles formed.  
Analyzing edge (0, 2): Triangle found!  
Analyzing edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.  
Analyzing edge (0, 9): Triangle found!  
Analyzing edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.  
Analyzing edge (2, 3): Triangle found!  
Analyzing edge (2, 4): No triangles formed.  
Analyzing edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.  
Analyzing edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.  
Analyzing edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.  
Analyzing edge (3, 9): Triangle found!  
Analyzing edge (6, 7): Triangle found!  
Analyzing edge (9, 7): No triangles formed.  

Count of triangles: 4  
Unique triangles found:  
<0, 2, 3>  
<0, 2, 9>  
<2, 3, 6>  
<6, 7, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
