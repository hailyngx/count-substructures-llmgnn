Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 1
- Vertex 3: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 2 (original label 2) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 3 (original label 3) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 7 (original label 7) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 0 (original label 0) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 5 (original label 5) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 8 (original label 8) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 6 (original label 6) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 4 (original label 4) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 1 (original label 1) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 9 (original label 9) becomes Vertex 9

Now, we will examine each edge:

1. Edge (0, 6): Both vertices have degrees ≥3, so we proceed.
2. Edge (1, 2): Vertice 2 has degree 1 < degree of vertex 1, so we proceed.
3. Edge (1, 5): Vertex 5 has degree 2 < degree of vertex 1, so we proceed. This edge forms a triangle with vertex 1 and vertex 9.
4. Edge (1, 9): Both vertices have degrees ≥4, so we proceed.
5. Edge (2, 1): Ignore as we consider each edge only once.
6. Edge (3, 8): Both vertices have degrees <3, so we stop.
7. Edge (4, 7): Vertex 7 has degree 3 < degree of vertex 4, so we proceed. This edge forms a triangle with vertex 4 and vertex 9.
8. Edge (4, 9): Vertex 9 has degree 4 > degree of vertex 4, so we ignore this edge.
9. Edge (5, 1): Ignore as we consider each edge only once.
10. Edge (5, 6): Vertex 5 has degree 2 < degree of vertex 6, so we proceed. This edge forms a triangle with vertex 1 and vertex 9.
11. Edge (6, 0): Ignore as we consider each edge only once.
12. Edge (6, 5): Ignore as we consider each edge only once.
13. Edge (7, 4): Ignore as we consider each edge only once.
14. Edge (8, 3): Both vertices have degrees <3, so we stop.
15. Edge (8, 9): Vertex 9 has degree 4 > degree of vertex 8, so we ignore this edge.
16. Edge (9, 1): Ignore as we consider each edge only once.
17. Edge (9, 4): Ignore as we consider each edge only once.
18. Edge (9, 8): Ignore as we consider each edge only once.

Total Number of Triangles: 3
Unique Triangles: <1, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 9> and <1, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
