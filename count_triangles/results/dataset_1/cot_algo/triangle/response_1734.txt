Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Vertices: 3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 0, 8, 9, 6, 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Check the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   (0, 1): 1 shares connections with 0 and 7.
   (0, 4): 0 and 5 share connections with 0.
   (0, 5): 0 and 4 share connections with 0.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 5>
