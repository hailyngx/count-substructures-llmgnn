Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 0 -> 4 connections  
Node 1 -> 4 connections  
Node 3 -> 2 connections  
Node 6 -> 4 connections  
Node 9 -> 2 connections  
Node 2 -> 5 connections  
Node 7 -> 5 connections  
Node 5 -> 6 connections  
Node 8 -> 4 connections  
Node 4 -> 5 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider edges involving vertices with lower labels and fewer connections.  
Upon checking these edges, the triangles formed are:  
1. <0, 2, 5>  
2. <0, 2, 7>  
3. <0, 5, 1>  
4. <0, 5, 4>  
5. <0, 5, 6>  
6. <1, 2, 5>  
7. <1, 2, 7>  
8. <1, 5, 4>  
9. <1, 5, 6>  
10. <3, 4, 2>  
11. <3, 4, 5>  
12. <6, 4, 2>  
13. <6, 4, 5>  
14. <6, 5, 7>  

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
