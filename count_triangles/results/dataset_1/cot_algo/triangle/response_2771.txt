Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 0: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 1
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 4

Now, we'll relabel the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 0 (degree 2) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 1 (degree 2) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 2 (degree 3) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 3 (degree 4) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 4 (degree 3) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 5 (degree 4) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 6 (degree 2) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 7 (degree 1) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 8 (degree 2) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 9 (degree 4) -> Vertex 9

Now, we analyze each edge based on the relabeled vertices:

(0, 2): Both 0 and 2 have fewer connections than their relabeled counterparts 0->2, no triangle formed
(0, 5): 0 < 5, Shared connection with 2: <0, 2, 5>
(1, 3): Both 1 and 3 have the same number of connections as their relabeled counterparts, no triangle formed
(1, 4): Both 1 and 4 have the same number of connections as their relabeled counterparts, no triangle formed
(2, 3): 2 < 3, Shared connection with 2: <2, 3, 4>
(2, 8): Both 2 and 8 have fewer connections than their relabeled counterparts 2->8, no triangle formed
(3, 1): 3 > 1, proceed
(3, 2): 3 > 2, proceed
(3, 4): 3 < 4, Shared connection with 3: <3, 4, 5>
(3, 5): 3 < 5, Shared connection with 3: already counted as <3, 4, 5>
(4, 1): 4 > 1, proceed
(4, 3): 4 > 3, proceed
(4, 6): Both 4 and 6 have the same number of connections as their relabeled counterparts, no triangle formed
(5, 0): 5 > 0, proceed
(5, 3): 5 > 3, proceed
(5, 6): 5 > 6, proceed
(5, 9): Both 5 and 9 have the same number of connections as their relabeled counterparts, no triangle formed
(6, 4): 6 > 4, proceed
(6, 5): 6 < 5, Shared connection with 5: already counted as <0, 2, 5>
(7, 9): Both 7 and 9 have fewer connections than their relabeled counterparts 7->9, no triangle formed
(8, 2): 8 > 2, proceed
(8, 9): Both 8 and 9 have fewer connections than their relabeled counterparts 8->9, no triangle formed
(9, 5): 9 > 5, proceed
(9, 7): 9 > 7, proceed
(9, 8): 9 > 8, proceed

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 5>
