Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their connection degree:
Vertices by degree: 3, 8, 1, 5, 2, 9, 0, 7, 4, 6.

Now, we'll relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 → 0 (degree 3)
1 → 1 (degree 8)
2 → 2 (degree 1)
3 → 3 (degree 5)
4 → 4 (degree 2)
5 → 5 (degree 9)
6 → 6 (degree 0)
7 → 7 (degree 7)
8 → 8 (degree 4)
9 → 9 (degree 6)

Now, we'll check for triangles based on the connections:
Triangles: 
- <0, 6, 9>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <5, 6, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
