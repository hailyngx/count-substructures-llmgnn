Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their degrees, we have:
    Node 5 with degree 1
    Node 6 with degree 1
    Node 3 with degree 1
    Node 1 with degree 2
    Node 7 with degree 3
    Node 2 with degree 3
    Node 8 with degree 0
    Node 0 with degree 3
    Node 4 with degree 5
    Node 9 with degree 6

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 7): Node 0 and Node 7 share a connection with Node 4 forming the triangle <0, 4, 7>.
- Edge (0, 9): Node 0 and Node 9 share a connection with Node 2 forming the triangle <0, 2, 9>.
- Edge (1, 4): Nodes 1 and 4 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4): Nodes 2 and 4 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9): Node 2 and Node 9 share a connection with Node 4 forming the triangle <2, 4, 9>.
- Edge (3, 4): Node 3 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 1): Nodes 1 and 4 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 2): Nodes 2 and 4 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 3): Node 3 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 7): Node 4 and Node 7 share a connection with Node 0 forming the triangle <0, 4, 7>.
- Edge (5, 9): Node 5 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9): Node 6 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 0): Node 7 and Node 0 share a connection with Node 4 forming the triangle <0, 4, 7>.
- Edge (7, 4): Node 7 and Node 4 share a connection with Node 0 forming the triangle <0, 4, 7>.
- Edge (9, 0): Node 9 and Node 0 share a connection with Node 2 forming the triangle <0, 2, 9>.
- Edge (9, 2): Node 9 and Node 2 share a connection with Node 4 forming the triangle <2, 4, 9>.
- Edge (9, 5): Node 9 and Node 5 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 6): Node 9 and Node 6 do not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] which are <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>.
