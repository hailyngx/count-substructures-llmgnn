Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees:
   - Vertex 8: degree 1
   - Vertex 4: degree 2
   - Vertex 7: degree 2
   - Vertex 0: degree 3
   - Vertex 9: degree 3
   - Vertex 6: degree 3
   - Vertex 3: degree 3
   - Vertex 1: degree 4
   - Vertex 5: degree 5
   - Vertex 2: degree 5

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Vertex 8 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 0
   - Vertex 4 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 1
   - Vertex 7 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 2
   - Vertex 0 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 3
   - Vertex 9 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 4
   - Vertex 6 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 5
   - Vertex 3 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 6
   - Vertex 1 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 7
   - Vertex 5 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 8
   - Vertex 2 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 9

3. Check for triangles among the edges:
   - Triangles:
     - <0, 2, 1>
     - <0, 1, 7>
     - <0, 5, 6>
     - <2, 1, 7>
     - <2, 5, 6>

4. Output the total number of triangles: [5]
