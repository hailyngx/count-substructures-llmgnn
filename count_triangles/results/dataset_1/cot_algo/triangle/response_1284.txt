Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted vertices are:
Vertices: 7, 3, 8, 0, 6, 4, 5, 2, 1, 9

Now, we go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

For edge (0, 2):
- Both vertices have 4 connections.
- They share vertex 5.
- Triangle: <0, 2, 5>

For edge (0, 6):
- Vertex 0 has 4 connections, and vertex 6 has 4 connections.
- They share vertices 1 and 4.
- Triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 1, 6>, <4, 6, 1>

For edge (0, 9):
- Vertex 0 has 4 connections, and vertex 9 has 6 connections.
- They share vertices 1 and 4.
- Triangle: <0, 1, 4>

For edge (1, 4):
- Both vertices have 5 connections.
- They share vertex 5.
- Triangle: <1, 4, 5>

For edge (1, 5):
- Both vertices have 5 connections.
- They share vertices 2, 3, and 4.
- Triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 5>

For edge (1, 6):
- Vertex 1 has 5 connections, and vertex 6 has 4 connections.
- They share vertex 4.
- Triangle: <1, 4, 6>

- They share no common vertices.

For edge (3, 5):
- Both vertices have 4 connections.
- They share vertices 1 and 2.
- Triangle: <1, 2, 5>

For edge (4, 5):
- Both vertices have 6 connections.
- They share vertices 1, 9, and 2.
- Triangles: <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 9>
