Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles:

- (1, 3): Shared connection with 5 -> Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- (1, 6): Shared connection with 0 -> Triangle <1, 6, 0>
- (1, 7): No triangles formed
- (2, 0): Shared connection with 5 -> Triangle <2, 0, 5>
- (2, 5): No triangles formed
- (3, 1): Shared connection with 5 -> Triangle <3, 1, 5>
- (3, 5): Shared connection with 0 -> Triangle <3, 5, 0>
- (3, 9): Shared connection with 8 -> Triangle <3, 9, 8>
- (4, 0): Shared connection with 8 -> Triangle <4, 0, 8>
- (4, 5): Shared connection with 3 -> Triangle <4, 5, 3>
- (5, 2): Shared connection with 0 -> Triangle <5, 2, 0>
- (5, 3): Shared connections with 1 and 0 -> Triangles <5, 3, 1> and <5, 3, 0>
- (5, 4): Shared connections with 3 and 0 -> Triangles <5, 4, 3> and <5, 4, 0>
- (5, 6): Shared connections with 0 and 1 -> Triangles <5, 6, 0> and <5, 6, 1>
- (6, 0): Shared connection with 1 -> Triangle <6, 0, 1>
- (6, 1): No triangles formed
- (8, 0): Shared connection with 4 -> Triangle <8, 0, 4>
- (8, 4): Shared connection with 0 -> Triangle <8, 4, 0>
- (8, 9): Shared connection with 3 -> Triangle <8, 9, 3>
- (9, 3): Shared connection with 8 -> Triangle <9, 3, 8>
