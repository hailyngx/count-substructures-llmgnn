Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
We will first sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 5 is not connected to any other node.
Node 5 (degree 0)
  
Nodes 0 and 3 have 2 connections each.
Node 0 (degree 2)
Node 3 (degree 2)

Nodes 4, 6, and 9 have 3 connections each.
Node 4 (degree 3)
Node 6 (degree 3)
Node 9 (degree 3)

Nodes 1 and 2 have 4 connections each.
Node 1 (degree 4)
Node 2 (degree 4)

Nodes 7 and 8 have 5 connections each.
Node 7 (degree 5)
Node 8 (degree 5)

Next, we will relabel the nodes according to their degree:

Node 5 becomes Node 0
Node 0 becomes Node 1
Node 3 becomes Node 2
Node 4 becomes Node 3
Node 6 becomes Node 4
Node 9 becomes Node 5
Node 1 becomes Node 6
Node 2 becomes Node 7
Node 7 becomes Node 8
Node 8 becomes Node 9

The edges are then sorted based on the new labels:

(1, 6) (1, 8) (9, 6) (0, 8) (3, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (2, 4) (4, 9) (8, 9) (4, 7) (0, 1) (8, 1) (2, 6) (7, 2) (9, 3) (8, 0) (1, 0) (8, 7) (3, 1)

Now we will count the triangles based on shared connections between the vertices:

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <1, 6, 8>
