Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 3 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 1 and 8 have 3 connections each.
- Node 2 has the highest number of connections with 4.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles. 

Number of triangles within brackets []: [3]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<4, 2, 9>
