Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices:

0: 4 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
1: 5 connections
4: 5 connections
9: 5 connections
5: 6 connections
7: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

- Edge (0, 5): Both 0 and 5 have 4 connections. No triangles are formed.
- Edge (0, 6): Both 0 and 6 have 4 connections. No triangles are formed.
- Edge (0, 7): Both 0 and 7 have 4 connections. No triangles are formed.
- Edge (0, 9): Both 0 and 9 have 4 connections. No triangles are formed.
