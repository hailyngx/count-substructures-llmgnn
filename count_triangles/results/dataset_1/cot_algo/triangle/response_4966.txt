Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 9, 1, 4, 5, 8, 0, 3, 9, 4, 7

After relabeling the vertices from 0 to 9, the updated edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2)

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 5>, <2, 7, 0>, <2, 7, 6>.
