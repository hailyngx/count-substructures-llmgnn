Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections (degree). 

The sorted vertices are: 
Vertex 3, Degree: 1
Vertex 6, Degree: 1
Vertex 4, Degree: 2
Vertex 2, Degree: 2
Vertex 7, Degree: 2
Vertex 1, Degree: 3
Vertex 9, Degree: 4
Vertex 5, Degree: 5
Vertex 8, Degree: 5
Vertex 0, Degree: 5

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges following the criteria mentioned.

Triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
