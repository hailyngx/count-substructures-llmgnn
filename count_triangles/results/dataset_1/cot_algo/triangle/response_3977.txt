Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex based on the given edges:

- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 2 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 1

Now, we need to sort these nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
1. Node 1 with degree 1
2. Node 2 with degree 1
3. Node 6 with degree 1
4. Node 7 with degree 1
5. Node 9 with degree 1
6. Node 8 with degree 3
7. Node 0 with degree 2
8. Node 5 with degree 4
9. Node 3 with degree 5

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by lower labeled vertices with fewer connections.

For the given edges:
- (0, 1) [Node 0 and Node 1]
- (0, 2) [Node 0 and Node 2]
- (1, 0) [Node 1 and Node 0]
- (2, 0) [Node 2 and Node 0]
- (3, 5) [Node 3 and Node 5]
- (3, 6) [Node 3 and Node 6]
- (3, 8) [Node 3 and Node 8]
- (3, 9) [Node 3 and Node 9]
- (5, 7) [Node 5 and Node 7]
- (5, 8) [Node 5 and Node 8]

Count of triangles = 1

The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 2>
