Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: <0, 5, 6, 9, 7, 4, 8, 3, 1, 2>.

Now, let's count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 8): No triangles formed.
2. Edge (1, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 7>.
3. Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (2, 7): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (4, 8): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (7, 8): Triangle <2, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
