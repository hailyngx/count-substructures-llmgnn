Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following mapping:
Node 3 - 1 connection
Node 7 - 1 connection
Node 5 - 2 connections
Node 0 - 3 connections
Node 6 - 0 connections
Node 2 - 3 connections
Node 4 - 5 connections
Node 8 - 4 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 9 - 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 4]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
