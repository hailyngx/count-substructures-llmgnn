Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on the number of connections they have. The sorted vertices are as follows: 

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 8 connections

Based on the sorted vertices, we will proceed to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 4>
<3, 5, 4>
<4, 5, 6>
