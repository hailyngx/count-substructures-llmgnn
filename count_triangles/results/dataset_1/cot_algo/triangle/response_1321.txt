Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following order: 

Node 4 has degree 1

Node 6 has degree 2

Nodes 1, 9 have degree 2

Nodes 5, 8 have degree 3

Nodes 2, 7 have degree 4

Node 0 has degree 5

Node 3 has degree 6

Now, we will go through each edge following the rules mentioned earlier: 
(4, 0) and (4, 8) do not form a triangle.
(6, 1) and (6, 7) do not form a triangle.
(1, 5) and (5, 7) do not form a triangle.
(9, 0) and (9, 3) form the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
(5, 1) and (5, 7) do not form a triangle.
(8, 4) and (4, 0) do not form a triangle.
(8, 5) and (5, 7) form the triangle <5, 7, 8>.
(2, 0) and (0, 4) do not form a triangle.
(3, 0) and (0, 4) do not form a triangle.
(2, 3) and (3, 0) do not form a triangle.
(8, 5) and (5, 1) do not form a triangle.
(0, 4) and (4, 8) do not form a triangle.
(3, 9) and (9, 0) do not form a triangle.
(1, 6) and (6, 7) form the triangle <1, 6, 7>.
(7, 3) and (3, 0) do not form a triangle.
(5, 7) and (7, 3) do not form a triangle.
(0, 9) and (9, 3) form the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
(7, 8) and (8, 5) form the triangle <5, 7, 8>.
(0, 2) and (2, 3) do not form a triangle.
(3, 7) and (7, 5) do not form a triangle.
(7, 6) and (6, 1) do not form a triangle.
(3, 9) and (9, 0) do not form a triangle.
(0, 3) and (3, 2) do not form a triangle.
(8, 7) and (7, 6) do not form a triangle.
(2, 3) and (3, 7) do not form a triangle.
(3, 7) and (7, 8) form the triangle <7, 8, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles are <0, 3, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, and <1, 6, 7>.
