Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, as follows:  

Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 5: 2 connections  
Node 9: 2 connections  
Node 3: 3 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 7: 5 connections  
Node 6: 5 connections  
Node 8: 6 connections  

Next, we will list the triangles found using the given edges:  

- Edge (0, 2) forms two triangles: <0, 2, 4> and <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (0, 4) does not form a triangle as node 4 has more connections than node 0
- Edge (0, 5) does not form a triangle as node 5 has more connections than node 0
- Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle as node 3 has more connections than node 1
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle as node 4 has more connections than node 1
- Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle: <1, 6, 7>
- Edge (1, 8) forms two triangles: <1, 6, 8> and <1, 8, 3>
- Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle as node 7 has more connections than node 2
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle as node 9 has more connections than node 2
- Edge (3, 7) forms two triangles: <3, 7, 4> and <3, 7, 6>
- Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle: <3, 8, 1>
- Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle: <4, 7, 6>
- Edge (4, 8) forms two triangles: <4, 7, 8> and <4, 8, 1>
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle as node 8 has more connections than node 5
- Edge (6, 7) forms a triangle: <6, 7, 4>
- Edge (6, 8) forms two triangles: <6, 7, 8> and <6, 8, 1>
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle as node 9 has more connections than node 6  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
