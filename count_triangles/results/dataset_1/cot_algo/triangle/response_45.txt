Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method first requires sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly. 

Sorted list of vertices based on their degree:
Vertices - Degrees
3 - 0
0 - 2
8 - 2
1 - 3
9 - 3
5 - 3
4 - 4
6 - 4
7 - 4
2 - 4

Based on the sorted list, we relabel the vertices:
Vertex 3 - Label 0
Vertex 0 - Label 1
Vertex 8 - Label 2
Vertex 1 - Label 3
Vertex 9 - Label 4
Vertex 5 - Label 5
Vertex 4 - Label 6
Vertex 6 - Label 7
Vertex 7 - Label 8
Vertex 2 - Label 9

Now, checking the edges and counting the triangles formed:
(0, 7) - No triangles
(0, 9) - No triangles
(1, 5) - No triangles
(1, 6) - No triangles
(1, 9) - No triangles
(2, 4) - No triangles
(2, 6) - No triangles
(4, 2) - No triangles
(4, 7) - No triangles
(4, 8) - No triangles
(5, 1) - No triangles
(5, 6) - Triangle <1, 5, 6>
(5, 7) - Triangle <1, 5, 7>
(6, 1) - No triangles
(6, 2) - No triangles
(6, 5) - Triangle <1, 5, 6>
(7, 0) - No triangles
(7, 4) - Triangle <1, 7, 5>
(7, 5) - Triangle <1, 7, 5>
(8, 4) - No triangles
(8, 9) - No triangles
(9, 0) - No triangles
(9, 1) - No triangles
(9, 8) - No triangles

Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [3]
