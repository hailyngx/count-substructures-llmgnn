Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 1: 0 edges
Node 9: 1 edge
Node 6: 1 edge
Node 5: 2 edges
Node 7: 2 edges
Node 1: 2 edges
Node 4: 3 edges
Node 0: 4 edges
Node 3: 5 edges
Node 2: 6 edges

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges as follows since the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
(1,9), (5,6), (5,7), (7,1), (7,4), (9,1)

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 4>
