Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

0: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 1 connection
3: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 5 connections
9: 6 connections

Now we'll relabel the vertices based on their degree:

2: 1 connection
0: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
8: 5 connections
9: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we'll count the triangles:

- Edge between 0 and 3: Triangle with node 8: <0, 3, 8>
- Edge between 0 and 7: No triangles
- Edge between 0 and 9: Triangle with nodes 3 and 8: <0, 9, 3> and <0, 9, 8>
- Edge between 1 and 4: No triangles
- Edge between 1 and 5: No triangles
- Edge between 1 and 8: Triangle with nodes 3 and 5: <1, 8, 3> and <1, 8, 5>
- Edge between 2 and 9: No triangles
- Edge between 3 and 8: Triangle with nodes 1 and 5: <3, 8, 1> and <3, 8, 5>
- Edge between 3 and 9: Triangle with node 8: <3, 9, 8>
- Edge between 4 and 9: Triangle with nodes 3, 6, and 8: <4, 9, 3>, <4, 9, 6>, <4, 9, 8>, and <4, 9, 6>
- Edge between 5 and 8: No triangles
- Edge between 6 and 7: Triangle with nodes 4 and 9: <6, 7, 4> and <6, 7, 9>
- Edge between 6 and 9: Triangle with node 4: <6, 9, 4>
- Edge between 7 and 8: Triangle with nodes 3 and 9: <7, 8, 3> and <7, 8, 9>
- Edge between 7 and 9: Triangle with nodes 4 and 6: <7, 9, 4> and <7, 9, 6>
- Edge between 8 and 9: Triangle with nodes 4, 6, and 7: <8, 9, 4>, <8, 9, 6>, <8, 9, 7>
