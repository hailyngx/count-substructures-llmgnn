Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the relabeling is as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5

Now we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Checking edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 6): Both vertices have degree 2. No triangles.
- Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 has degree 4, while vertex 5 has degree 2. No triangles.
- Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has degree 4, while vertex 7 has degree 5. Checking shared connections: 1 is connected to 5 and 9, 7 is connected to 4, 3, 8, and 9. Shared connection with 9 forms a triangle <1, 7, 9>.
- Edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 has degree 4, while vertex 9 has degree 2. No triangles.
- Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 has degree 5, while vertex 4 has degree 3. Checking shared connections: 2 is connected to 9, 4 is connected to 7. Shared connection forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
- Edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has degree 5, while vertex 9 has degree 2. No triangles.
- Edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 has degree 4, while vertex 6 has degree 2. No triangles.
- Edge (3, 7): Vertex 3 has degree 4, while vertex 7 has degree 5. Checking shared connections: 3 is connected to 8, 6 is connected to 0. No triangles.
- Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 has degree 4, while vertex 8 has degree 3. No triangles.
- Edge (4, 2): Vertex 4 has degree 3, while vertex 2 has degree 5. Checking shared connections: 4 is connected to 7, 2 is connected to 9. Shared connection forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
- Edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 has degree 3, while vertex 7 has degree 5. Checking shared connections: 4 is connected to 2, 7 is connected to 1, 3, 8, 9. Shared connection with 2 forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
- Edge (5, 1): Vertex 5 has degree 2, while vertex 1 has degree 4. No triangles.
- Edge (6, 0): Both vertices have degree 2. No triangles.
- Edge (6, 3): Vertex 6 has degree 2, while vertex 3 has degree 4. No triangles.
- Edge (7, 1): Vertex 7 has degree 5, while vertex 1 has degree 4. Checking shared connections: 7 is connected to 3, 4, 8, 9, 1 is connected to 5, 9. Shared connection with 9 forms a triangle <1, 7, 9>.
- Edge (7, 3): Vertex 7 has degree 5, while vertex 3 has degree 4. Checking shared connections: 7 is connected to 4, 3 is connected to 8, 6. No triangles.
- Edge (7, 4): Vertex 7 has degree 5, while vertex 4 has degree 3. Checking shared connections: 7 is connected to 1, 3, 8, 9, 4 is connected to 2, 7. Shared connection with 2 forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
- Edge (7, 8): Vertex 7 has degree 5, while vertex 8 has degree 3. Checking shared connections: 7 is connected to 4, 8 is connected to 3. No triangles.
- Edge (8, 3): Vertex 8 has degree 3, while vertex 3 has degree 4. No triangles.
- Edge (8, 7): Vertex 8 has degree 3, while vertex 7 has degree 5. Checking shared connections: 8 is connected to 7, 7 is connected to 1, 3, 4, 8, 9. Shared connection with 1 forms a triangle <1, 7, 8>.
- Edge (9, 1): Vertex 9 has degree 2, while vertex 1 has degree 4. No triangles.
- Edge (9, 2): Vertex 9 has degree 2, while vertex 2 has degree 5. No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <1, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 8>.
