Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0: 1 edge
Vertex 1: 1 edge
Vertex 3: 2 edges
Vertex 7: 2 edges
Vertex 6: 2 edges
Vertex 9: 3 edges
Vertex 8: 4 edges
Vertex 5: 4 edges
Vertex 4: 4 edges
Vertex 2: 5 edges

After relabeling the vertices, we get:
Vertex 0 (degree 1) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 1 (degree 1) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 3 (degree 2) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 7 (degree 2) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 6 (degree 2) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 9 (degree 3) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 8 (degree 4) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 5 (degree 4) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 4 (degree 4) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 2 (degree 5) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will check the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Checking (0, 2): No triangle
Checking (1, 8): No triangle
Checking (2, 4): Triangle found: <2, 4, 8>
Checking (2, 6): No triangle
Checking (3, 5): No triangle
Checking (3, 7): No triangle
Checking (4, 7): Triangle found: <4, 5, 8>
Checking (4, 9): No triangle
Checking (5, 9): Triangle found: <5, 8, 9>
Checking (6, 8): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <2, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 9>
