Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
   Vertex 0 has 3 connections
   Vertex 1 has 4 connections
   Vertex 2 has 2 connections
   Vertex 3 has 3 connections
   Vertex 4 has 2 connections
   Vertex 5 has 4 connections
   Vertex 6 has 2 connections
   Vertex 7 has 4 connections
   Vertex 8 has 4 connections
   Vertex 9 has 1 connection

2. Relabel the vertices:
   Vertex 0 (2 connections)
   Vertex 1 (4 connections)
   Vertex 2 (2 connections)
   Vertex 3 (3 connections)
   Vertex 4 (2 connections)
   Vertex 5 (4 connections)
   Vertex 6 (2 connections)
   Vertex 7 (4 connections)
   Vertex 8 (4 connections)
   Vertex 9 (1 connection)

3. Count the triangles:
   - (0, 3) and (0, 4) share connection 0, forming triangle <0, 3, 4>.
   - (0, 3) and (0, 8) share connection 0, forming triangle <0, 3, 8>.
   - (0, 4) and (0, 8) share connection 0, forming triangle <0, 4, 8>.
   - (1, 2) and (1, 5) share connection 1, forming triangle <1, 2, 5>.
   - (1, 5) and (1, 6) share connection 1, forming triangle <1, 5, 6>.
   - (1, 5) and (1, 9) share connection 1, forming triangle <1, 5, 9>.
   - (1, 6) and (1, 9) share connection 1, forming triangle <1, 6, 9>.
   - (2, 1) and (2, 5) share connection 2, forming triangle <2, 1, 5>.
   - (3, 0) and (3, 5) share connection 3, forming triangle <3, 0, 5>.
   - (3, 5) and (3, 7) share connection 3, forming triangle <3, 5, 7>.
   - (4, 0) and (4, 8) share connection 4, forming triangle <4, 0, 8>.
   - (5, 7) and (5, 8) share connection 5, forming triangle <5, 7, 8>.
   - (7, 3) and (7, 6) share connection 7, forming triangle <7, 3, 6>.
   - (7, 5) and (7, 6) share connection 7, forming triangle <7, 5, 6>.
   - (7, 5) and (7, 8) share connection 7, forming triangle <7, 5, 8>.
   - (8, 5) and (8, 7) share connection 8, forming triangle <8, 5, 7>.

Total number of triangles: [15]
