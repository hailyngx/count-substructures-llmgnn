Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 3: Degree 1
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 1

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges as described. 

Analyzing the edges, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle <2, 8, 9>
- Triangle <4, 5, 8>
- Triangle <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle <5, 6, 8>
- Triangle <6, 7, 8>

There are 11 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
