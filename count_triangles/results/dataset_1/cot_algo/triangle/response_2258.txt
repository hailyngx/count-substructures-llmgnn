Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections.

The sorted vertices are: 
0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 4)
2 (degree 2)
4 (degree 3)
6 (degree 1)
7 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
9 (degree 5)

Now, we will check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Checking edge (0, 3): Both vertices have 2 connections, so we proceed.
Checking edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has 2 connections, so we proceed.

Checking edge (1, 2): Both vertices have 4 connections, so we skip.
Checking edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
Checking edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has 4 connections, so we proceed.
Checking edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 has 4 connections, so we proceed.

Checking edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has 2 connections, so we proceed.

Checking edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
Checking edge (3, 7): Vertex 3 has 3 connections, so we proceed.

Checking edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 has 3 connections, so we proceed.

Checking edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has 3 connections, so we proceed.

Counting the total number of triangles inside brackets [] gives [1].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 7>
