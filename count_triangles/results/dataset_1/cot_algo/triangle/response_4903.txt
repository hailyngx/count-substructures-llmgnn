Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices in this graph is: 5, 9, 3, 4, 0, 8, 7, 2, 1, 6.

Now, we will count the triangles:

- For vertex 5: No triangles as it has 0 connections.
- For vertex 9: No triangles as it has 0 connections.
- For vertex 3: No triangles as it has 2 connections.
- For vertex 4: Triangles: <0, 4, 6>.
- For vertex 0: Triangles: <0, 1, 4> and <0, 6, 8>.
- For vertex 8: Triangles: <0, 6, 8> and <4, 6, 8>.
- For vertex 7: Triangles: <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, and <4, 6, 7>.
- For vertex 2: No triangles as it has 2 connections.
- For vertex 1: Triangles: <0, 1, 4> and <1, 6, 7>.
- For vertex 6: Triangles: <0, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, and <6, 7, 8>.
