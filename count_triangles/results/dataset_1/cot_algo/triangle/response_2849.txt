Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:

The degrees of the vertices are:
0: 3
1: 1
2: 2
3: 1
4: 6
5: 2
7: 1
8: 2
9: 2

Sorting vertices by degrees:
1 < 3, 5, 7, 9 < 2, 8 < 4 < 0

Relabeled vertices:
1 -> 0
3, 5, 7, 9 -> 1, 2, 3, 4
2, 8 -> 5, 6
4 -> 7
0 -> 8

The sorted edges are:
(1, 9) (3, 4) (5, 8) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (9, 1) (5, 0) (8, 0) (8, 5)

Counting triangles:
1. (4, 0), (4, 3), (3, 4) -> <0, 3, 4>
2. (4, 0), (4, 2), (2, 4) -> <0, 2, 4>
3. (4, 0), (4, 7), (7, 4) -> <0, 4, 7>
4. (4, 0), (4, 9), (9, 4) -> <0, 4, 9>
5. (0, 5), (5, 8), (8, 0) -> <0, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [5]
