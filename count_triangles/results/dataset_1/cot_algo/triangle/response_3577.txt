Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, as given below:

Vertex 1: 0 connections
Vertex 7: 0 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 6 connections

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Checking each edge:

(0, 2):
Both have 4 connections. No triangles formed.

(0, 3):
0 has 4 connections, and 3 has 5 connections.
No triangles formed.

(0, 4):
0 has 4 connections, and 4 has 5 connections.
Shared connections: 5
Triangle found: <0, 4, 5>

(0, 5):
Both have 4 connections. No triangles formed.

(1, 4):
1 has 0 connections, and 4 has 5 connections.
No triangles formed.

(2, 0):
Both have 4 connections. No triangles formed.

(2, 6):
Both have 4 connections. No triangles formed.

(3, 0):
3 has 5 connections, and 0 has 4 connections.
Shared connections: 4
Triangle found: <0, 3, 6>

(3, 6):
3 has 5 connections, and 6 has 4 connections.
Shared connections: 3
Triangle found: <0, 3, 6>

(3, 8):
3 has 5 connections, and 8 has 6 connections.
No triangles formed.

(4, 0):
