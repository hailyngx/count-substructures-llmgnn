Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices in the Degree-Based Ordering:

Vertices:
1. 1 (degree 1)
2. 3 (degree 1)
3. 8 (degree 1)
4. 7 (degree 2)
5. 8 (degree 2)
6. 5 (degree 3)
7. 6 (degree 3)
8. 4 (degree 4)
9. 9 (degree 7)
10. 0 (degree 8)

Now, let's count the triangles:

- Looking at the edges starting from the vertex with the lowest degree (vertex 1):
  - No triangles formed from vertex 1.

- Moving on to vertex 3:
  - No triangles formed from vertex 3.

- Moving on to vertex 8:
  - No triangles formed from vertex 8.

- Moving on to vertex 7:
  - No triangles formed from vertex 7.

- Moving on to vertex 5:
  - No triangles formed from vertex 5.

- Moving on to vertex 6:
  - No triangles formed from vertex 6.

- Moving on to vertex 4:
  - No triangles formed from vertex 4.

- Moving on to vertex 9:
  - From vertex 9, we find the triangle <2, 5, 9>.

- Finally, moving on to vertex 0:
  - From vertex 0, we find the triangle <0, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
