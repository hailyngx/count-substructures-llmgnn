Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are:
Vertex 0: Degree 2
Vertex 3: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 2
Vertex 9: Degree 2
Vertex 6: Degree 3
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 5: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 5

Based on the edges given, we find the following triangles:
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
