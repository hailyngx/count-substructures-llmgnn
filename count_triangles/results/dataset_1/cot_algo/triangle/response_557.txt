Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to analyze the number of triangles in the graph efficiently. 

Let's first sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles by examining the edges based on the sorted order of vertices:

There are 2 triangles:
1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <0, 2, 9>

Finally, we calculate the total number of triangles:
