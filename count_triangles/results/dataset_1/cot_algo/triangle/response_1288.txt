Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:

Node 8 has 1 connection.
Nodes 2, 4, 8 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 1, 3, 9 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 0, 6 have 4 connections each.
Node 5 has 6 connections.
Node 7 has 7 connections.

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

Edge (0, 5): Node 0 and Node 5 share connections with Node 6, Node 7. So, one triangle <0, 6, 5>.
Edge (0, 6): Node 0 and Node 6 share connections with Node 4, Node 5, Node 7. So, three triangles <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 6>.
Edge (0, 7): Node 0 and Node 7 share connections with Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6. So, four triangles <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 7>.
Edge (0, 9): Node 0 and Node 9 do not share connections to form triangles.
Edge (1, 4): Node 1 and Node 4 do not share connections to form triangles.
Edge (1, 5): Node 1 and Node 5 share connections with Node 0, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7. So, three triangles <1, 0, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 6, 5>.
Edge (1, 7): Node 1 and Node 7 share connections with Node 0, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6. So, four triangles <1, 0, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>.
Edge (1, 8): Node 1 and Node 8 do not share connections to form triangles.
Edge (2, 3): Node 2 and Node 3 do not share connections to form triangles.
Edge (2, 9): Node 2 and Node 9 do not share connections to form triangles.
Edge (3, 5): Node 3 and Node 5 share connections with Node 0, Node 1, Node 6, Node 7. So, two triangles <3, 0, 5>, <3, 1, 5>.
Edge (3, 7): Node 3 and Node 7 share connections with Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, Node 6. So, two triangles <3, 0, 7>, <3, 1, 7>.
Edge (4, 1): Node 4 and Node 1 do not share connections to form triangles.
Edge (4, 6): Node 4 and Node 6 share connections with Node 0, Node 5, Node 7. So, one triangle <4, 0, 6>.
Edge (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7): Already counted triangles.
Edge (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7): Already counted triangles.
Edge (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6): Already counted triangles.
Edge (8, 1): Node 8 and Node 1 do not share connections to form triangles.
Edge (9, 0), (9, 2): Nodes 9 and 0, 2 do not share connections to form triangles.

Total number of triangles: [1 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1] = [20]

Therefore, there are 20 triangles in the given graph.
