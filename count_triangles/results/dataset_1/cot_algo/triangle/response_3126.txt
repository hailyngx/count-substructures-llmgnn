Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
- Vertex 3 with degree 1 
- Vertex 1 with degree 2 
- Vertex 5 with degree 2 
- Vertex 8 with degree 2 
- Vertex 6 with degree 3 
- Vertex 9 with degree 3 
- Vertex 2 with degree 4 
- Vertex 4 with degree 5 
- Vertex 7 with degree 6 
- Vertex 0 with degree 7 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

Checking the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 3): No triangles
- Edge (1, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 0>
- Edge (2, 6): No triangles
- Edge (3, 0): No triangles
- Edge (4, 0): Triangle <4, 0, 1>
- Edge (5, 4): Triangle <5, 4, 0>
- Edge (6, 2): No triangles
- Edge (7, 0): Triangles <7, 0, 1>, <7, 0, 4>
- Edge (8, 0): No triangles
- Edge (9, 0): Triangle <9, 0, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] and the unique triangles found are: <1, 4, 0>, <5, 4, 0>, <7, 0, 1>, <7, 0, 4>, <9, 0, 5>.
