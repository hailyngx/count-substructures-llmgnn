Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their degree:

Vertices:
0 - degree 2
1 - degree 3
2 - degree 3
4 - degree 4
6 - degree 3
9 - degree 2
5 - degree 1
7 - degree 1
8 - degree 2

Using the relabeled vertices, the edges are as follows:
(0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9)

Calculating the triangles, we find:
- Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle <6, 8, 5>
- Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
