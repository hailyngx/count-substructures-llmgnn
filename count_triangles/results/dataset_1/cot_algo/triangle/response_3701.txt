Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we relabel the nodes as follows:
- Node 7 (Degree 0)
- Node 7 (Degree 0)
- Node 0 (Degree 2)
- Node 3 (Degree 2)
- Node 5 (Degree 2)
- Node 6 (Degree 2)
- Node 8 (Degree 2)
- Node 1 (Degree 4)
- Node 2 (Degree 3)
- Node 4 (Degree 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, the triangles found are:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <1, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
