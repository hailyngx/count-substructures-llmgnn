Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertices: 7, 5, 1, 7, 9, 2, 6, 1, 3, 0

Reordering the vertices, we get:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Triangles found: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>

The total number of triangles is [2].
