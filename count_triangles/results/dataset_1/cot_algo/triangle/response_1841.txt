Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Nodes: 6, 0, 9, 4, 7, 8, 5, 1, 3, 2

Using this ordering, the triangles in the graph can be found as follows:
- Triangle 1: <2, 3, 4>
- Triangle 2: <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle 3: <2, 3, 8>
- Triangle 4: <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 6: <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle 7: <3, 4, 5>
- Triangle 8: <3, 4, 8>
- Triangle 9: <3, 5, 8>
- Triangle 10: <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. 

The output is: [10]
