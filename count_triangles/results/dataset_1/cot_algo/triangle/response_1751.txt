Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 3 -> 0 connections
Node 1 -> 0 connections
Node 7 -> 1 connection
Node 4 -> 1 connection
Node 9 -> 1 connection
Node 8 -> 2 connections
Node 5 -> 3 connections
Node 2 -> 4 connections
Node 6 -> 6 connections
Node 0 -> 7 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 0 has 7 connections. Since Node 2 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections with Node 0 -> Triangle <0, 2, 1>.
- Edge (0, 6): Node 6 has 6 connections, so we check for shared connections with Node 0 -> Triangle <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 5>.
- Edge (0, 7): Node 7 has 1 connection, so we check for shared connections with Node 0 -> No triangle.
- Edge (1, 2): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 1 has 0 connections. We check for shared connections with Node 1 -> Triangle <1, 2, 0>.
- Edge (2, 8): Node 8 has 2 connections, so we check for shared connections with Node 2 -> No triangle.
- Edge (3, 6): Node 6 has 6 connections, so we check for shared connections with Node 3 -> No triangle.
- Edge (4, 6): Node 6 has 6 connections, so we check for shared connections with Node 4 -> No triangle.
- Edge (5, 6): Node 6 has 6 connections, so we check for shared connections with Node 5 -> Triangle <5, 6, 0>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>.
- Edge (5, 8): Node 8 has 2 connections, so we check for shared connections with Node 5 -> No triangle.
- Edge (5, 9): Node 9 has 1 connection, so we check for shared connections with Node 5 -> No triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
