Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 3: Degree 1
Node 2: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 6

Now, we will proceed by examining the edges according to the method:

Edge (2, 7) - Proceed
Edge (3, 8) - Proceed
Edge (4, 5) - Proceed
Edge (4, 8) - Proceed
Edge (4, 9) - Proceed
Edge (5, 8) - Proceed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 0>
<1, 0, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<8, 3, 4>
<8, 3, 5>
<8, 4, 5>
<8, 4, 6>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 5, 6>
<8, 5, 7>
