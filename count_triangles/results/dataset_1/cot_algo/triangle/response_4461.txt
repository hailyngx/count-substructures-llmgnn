Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  

Node 1 has 1 connection  
Node 2 has 3 connections  
Node 3 has 2 connections  
Node 4 has 2 connections  
Node 5 has 3 connections  
Node 6 has 3 connections  
Node 7 has 6 connections  
Node 8 has 2 connections  
Node 9 has 2 connections  

Now, looking at the edges based on the lowest labeled vertex having fewer connections, we evaluate potential triangles:  

1. Edge between Node 1 and Node 7: No triangles can be formed as Node 1 has fewer connections.  
2. Edge between Node 2 and Node 4: No triangles can be formed due to connection counts.  
3. Edge between Node 2 and Node 6: No triangles can be formed due to connection counts.  
4. Edge between Node 2 and Node 8: No triangles can be formed due to connection counts.  
5. Edge between Node 3 and Node 5: A triangle is formed with Node 7: <3, 5, 7>.  
6. Edge between Node 3 and Node 9: No triangles can be formed due to connection counts.  
7. Edge between Node 4 and Node 7: No triangles can be formed due to connection counts.  
8. Edge between Node 5 and Node 9: No triangles can be formed due to connection counts.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] and the unique triangles found are <3, 5, 7>.
