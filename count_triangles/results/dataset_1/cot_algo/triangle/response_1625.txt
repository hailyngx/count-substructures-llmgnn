Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the nodes based on their degree (number of connections):
Nodes by degree: 
1. Node 1 (degree 1)
2. Node 4 (degree 1)
3. Node 6 (degree 2)
4. Node 9 (degree 2)
5. Node 5 (degree 3)
6. Node 7 (degree 4)
7. Node 0 (degree 6)
8. Node 3 (degree 4)
9. Node 1 (degree 5)
10. Node 8 (degree 7)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:
Triangles: [7]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 8, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<8, 9, 6>
