Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
- Node 0: Degree 5
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 1
- Node 5: Degree 2
- Node 6: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 6
- Node 1: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 9: Degree 4

Based on the relabeled vertices, we consider the edges in the following order:
1. (0, 2): Forms triangle with 1, 8 <0, 1, 2>
2. (0, 4): No new triangles
3. (0, 5): No new triangles
4. (0, 6): No new triangles
5. (0, 8): Forms triangle with 1, 2 <0, 1, 8>
6. (1, 2): Forms triangle with 0, 8 <1, 0, 2>
7. (1, 6): No new triangles
8. (1, 7): Forms triangle with 8, 9 <1, 8, 9>
9. (1, 8): No new triangles
10. (1, 9): No new triangles
11. (2, 0): No new triangles
12. (2, 1): No new triangles
13. (2, 8): Forms triangle with 0, 1 <2, 0, 1>
14. (4, 0): No new triangles
15. (5, 0): No new triangles
16. (5, 9): Forms triangle with 1, 8 <5, 1, 9>
17. (6, 0): No new triangles
18. (6, 1): No new triangles
19. (7, 1): No new triangles
20. (7, 8): Forms triangle with 1, 9 <7, 1, 8>
21. (8, 0): Forms triangle with 1, 2 <8, 1, 0>
22. (8, 1): No new triangles
23. (8, 2): No new triangles
24. (8, 7): Forms triangle with 1, 9 <8, 1, 7>
25. (8, 9): Forms triangle with 1, 7 <8, 1, 9>
26. (9, 1): No new triangles
27. (9, 5): No new triangles
28. (9, 8): No new triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 0, 1>, <5, 1, 9>, <8, 1, 0>, <8, 1, 7>, <8, 1, 9>.
