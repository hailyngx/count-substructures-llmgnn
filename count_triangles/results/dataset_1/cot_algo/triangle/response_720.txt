Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method can help us find the total number of triangles. First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices in decreasing order of degrees:
9(1) -> 0, 1, 5(2) -> 4, 6, 2, 7(3) -> 3, 8(5)

Now, let's find the triangles. Starting with the lowest-degree vertex:
1. For vertex 9: No triangles as it has only one connection.
2. For vertex 0: No triangles as it has one connection.
3. For vertex 5: Triangle <4, 5, 6>.
4. For vertex 4: No triangles as it has two connections.
5. For vertex 6: Triangles <3, 6, 7> and <6, 7, 8>.
6. For vertex 2: No triangles as it has three connections.
7. For vertex 7: No triangles as it has three connections.
8. For vertex 3: No triangles as it has four connections.
9. For vertex 8: Triangles <1, 8, 9> and <6, 8, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <4, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, <1, 8, 9>
