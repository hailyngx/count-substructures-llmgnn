Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex based on the given edges:
- Node 1 has degree 6
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 2

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
- Node 8 (degree 1)
- Node 3, 4, 6, 9 (degree 2)
- Node 5, 7 (degree 3)
- Node 1 (degree 6)

Next, we examine the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Edge (3, 6) (Both nodes have 2 connections, so we proceed)
  Shared connections: 1
- Edge (3, 7) (Both nodes have 2 connections, so we proceed)
  Shared connections: 1
- Edge (4, 1) (Node 4 has 2 connections, node 1 has 6 connections, so we proceed)
  Shared connections: None
- Edge (4, 5) (Both nodes have 2 connections, so we proceed)
  Shared connections: None
- Edge (8, 1) (Node 8 has 1 connection, node 1 has 6 connections, so we proceed)
  Shared connections: None

Counting the triangles formed:
- Total triangles: [2]
- Unique triangles: <3, 6, 1> <3, 7, 1>
