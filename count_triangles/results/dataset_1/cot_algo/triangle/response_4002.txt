Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

0 -> 3 connections
1 -> 3 connections
2 -> 2 connections
3 -> 5 connections
5 -> 4 connections
6 -> 5 connections
7 -> 4 connections
8 -> 1 connection
9 -> 1 connection

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

For the edge (0, 3):
- Both 0 and 3 have 3 connections each, proceed.

For the edge (0, 7):
- 0 has 3 connections, which is less than 4 connections of 7, so proceed.
- Checking for shared connections, we find that 0, 3, and 7 form a triangle.

For the edge (0, 8):
- 0 has 3 connections, which is less than 1 connection of 8, so proceed.

For the edge (1, 5):
- Both 1 and 5 have 3 connections each, proceed.

For the edge (1, 6):
- 1 has 3 connections, which is less than 5 connections of 6, so proceed.

For the edge (1, 7):
- 1 has 3 connections, which is less than 4 connections of 7, so proceed.
- Checking for shared connections, we find that 1, 3, and 7 form a triangle.

For the edge (2, 3):
- 2 has 2 connections, which is less than 5 connections of 3, so proceed.

For the edge (2, 6):
- 2 has 2 connections, which is less than 5 connections of 6, so proceed.

For the edge (3, 5):
- 3 has 5 connections, which is more than 4 connections of 5, so do not proceed.

For the edge (3, 7):
- 3 has 5 connections, which is more than 4 connections of 7, so do not proceed.

For the edge (5, 6):
- 5 has 4 connections, which is less than 5 connections of 6, so proceed.

For the edge (6, 7):
- 6 has 5 connections, which is more than 4 connections of 7, so do not proceed.

For the edge (6, 9):
- 6 has 5 connections, which is more than 1 connection of 9, so do not proceed.

After going through all the edges, we have found 2 triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
