Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0 - 2 connections
Vertex 1 - 0 connections
Vertex 2 - 6 connections
Vertex 3 - 2 connections
Vertex 4 - 3 connections
Vertex 5 - 1 connection
Vertex 6 - 5 connections
Vertex 7 - 2 connections
Vertex 8 - 2 connections
Vertex 9 - 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we check the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 2): Forms triangle with shared connection to vertex 4. Triangle = <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (0, 4): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 5): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 6): Forms triangle with shared connections to vertices 0 and 4. Triangle = <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (3, 6): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 9): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 8): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 6): Forms triangle with shared connection to vertex 4. Triangle = <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [2], and the unique triangles found inside <> are <0, 2, 4> and <4, 6, 9>.
