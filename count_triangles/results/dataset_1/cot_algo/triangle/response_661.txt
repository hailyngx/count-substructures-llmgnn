Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 1 has 2 edges.
Node 4 has 2 edges.
Node 8 has 2 edges.
Node 6 has 3 edges.
Node 7 has 3 edges.
Node 5 has 4 edges.
Node 3 has 4 edges.
Node 9 has 6 edges.
Node 0 has 6 edges.
Node 2 has 6 edges.

Sorted nodes based on the number of edges:
1, 4, 8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 9, 0, 2

After relabeling the nodes accordingly, the edges are as follows:
(1, 5) (4, 3) (8, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (5, 0) (3, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5)

Number of triangles = 9

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
The unique triangles found are <3, 5, 9>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 9>.
