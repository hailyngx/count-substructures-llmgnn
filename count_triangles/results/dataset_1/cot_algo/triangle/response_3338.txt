Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their degrees from least to most, we get the following list: 

Node 8: Degree 1  
Node 3: Degree 1  
Node 5: Degree 1  
Node 4: Degree 1  
Node 6: Degree 2  
Node 2: Degree 2  
Node 0: Degree 4  
Node 1: Degree 4  
Node 7: Degree 5  
Node 9: Degree 8  

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will count the number of triangles in the graph.

Calculating the triangles:  
For edge (0, 1): No triangles  
For edge (0, 3): No triangles  
For edge (0, 6): No triangles  
For edge (0, 9): Triangles <0, 6, 9>  
For edge (1, 7): No triangles  
For edge (1, 9): Triangles <1, 7, 9>  
For edge (2, 7): No triangles  
For edge (2, 9): No triangles  
For edge (4, 7): No triangles  
For edge (5, 9): No triangles  
For edge (6, 9): No triangles  
For edge (7, 9): Triangles <0, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 9>  
For edge (8, 9): No triangles  

Total number of triangles: [4]  
Unique triangles found: <0, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <0, 7, 9>
