Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree:
- Node 0 (degree 2) becomes Node 0
- Node 2 (degree 2) becomes Node 1
- Node 3 (degree 2) becomes Node 2
- Node 7 (degree 2) becomes Node 3
- Node 8 (degree 2) becomes Node 4
- Node 5 (degree 1) becomes Node 5
- Node 1 (degree 3) becomes Node 6
- Node 4 (degree 3) becomes Node 7
- Node 9 (degree 4) becomes Node 8
- Node 6 (degree 6) becomes Node 9

Now, let's examine the edges starting from the ones with the lower labeled vertices:
- (0, 4) - Node 0 and Node 7 have a shared connection with Node 6, forming triangle <0, 4, 6>.
- (0, 8) - Node 0 and Node 4 don't have a shared connection.
- (1, 6) - Node 6 and Node 1 share connection with Node 2 forming triangle <1, 6, 2>.
- (1, 9) - No shared connection.
- (2, 6) - No shared connection.
- (3, 6) - No shared connection.
- (4, 6) - No shared connection.
- (4, 9) - Node 4 and Node 9 share connection with Node 6 forming triangle <4, 9, 6>.
- (5, 6) - No shared connection.
- (6, 9) - Node 6 and Node 9 share connection with Node 4 forming triangle <6, 9, 4>.
- (7, 9) - No shared connection.

The total number of triangles is [3].
