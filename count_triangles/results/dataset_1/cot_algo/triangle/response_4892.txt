Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the relabeled graph with 10 nodes becomes:

Nodes: 2, 7, 8, 6, 4, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1

The edges to consider based on the Degree-Based Ordering method are:
(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8), (3, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 7), (6, 9), (9, 8)

Calculating the number of triangles using the shared connections, we find:
Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<4, 0, 9>
<6, 9, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
