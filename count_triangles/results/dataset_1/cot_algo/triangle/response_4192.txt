Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by degree, the new labels for the 10 nodes are: 

0 (degree 3), 1 (degree 4), 2 (degree 3), 3 (degree 5), 4 (degree 6), 5 (degree 3), 6 (degree 4), 7 (degree 5), 8 (degree 5), 9 (degree 3).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will count the number of triangles. 

Triangles:
[<0, 4, 8> <1, 3, 7> <1, 4, 6> <2, 4, 7> <2, 4, 9> <3, 4, 7> <3, 4, 8>]

The total number of triangles in the graph is: [7].
