Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices:  
6 - 1 connection  
7 - 1 connection  
3 - 1 connection  
0 - 2 connections  
9 - 2 connections  
4 - 3 connections  
8 - 3 connections  
5 - 4 connections  
1 - 5 connections  
2 - 5 connections  

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:

1. (0, 6): No triangles
2. (0, 9): No triangles
3. (1, 2): Triangle formed with node 5: <1, 2, 5>
4. (1, 4): No triangles
5. (1, 5): No triangles
6. (1, 8): Triangle formed with node 2: <1, 2, 8>
7. (2, 1): Already counted
8. (2, 5): Already counted
9. (2, 8): Already counted
10. (2, 9): Triangle formed with node 0: <0, 2, 9>
11. (3, 4): No triangles
12. (4, 1): Already counted
13. (4, 3): No triangles
14. (5, 1): Already counted
15. (5, 2): Already counted
16. (5, 7): No triangles
17. (6, 0): No triangles
18. (7, 5): No triangles
19. (8, 1): Already counted
20. (8, 2): Already counted
21. (9, 0): Already counted
22. (9, 2): Already counted

Total number of triangles: [3]
Found triangles: <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>
