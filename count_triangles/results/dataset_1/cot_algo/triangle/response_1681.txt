Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices will be:
0 - degree 2
1 - degree 2
3 - degree 2
4 - degree 2
7 - degree 2
5 - degree 3
8 - degree 3
6 - degree 4
9 - degree 5
2 - degree 5

Now, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 8) (7, 9)

By checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
