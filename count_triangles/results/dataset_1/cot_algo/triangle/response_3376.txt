Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will count the number of triangles:

1. (0, 2) - Shared connections: 1, 8
2. (0, 8) - Shared connections: 2, 6, 7
3. (0, 9) - No triangle
4. (1, 2) - Shared connections: 0
5. (1, 5) - Shared connections: 4
6. (1, 6) - No triangle
7. (2, 1) - Shared connections: 0
8. (2, 3) - No triangle
9. (2, 7) - No triangle
10. (3, 8) - Shared connections: 0
11. (4, 5) - No triangle
12. (5, 1) - Shared connections: 0
13. (5, 4) - No triangle
14. (6, 1) - No triangle
15. (6, 8) - Shared connections: 0
16. (7, 2) - No triangle
17. (7, 8) - Shared connections: 0
18. (8, 3) - No triangle

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
