Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method steps are as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections:
   - Vertex 5: 0 connections
   - Vertices 0, 1, 4, 8: 2 connections
   - Vertices 2, 6, 9: 3 connections
   - Vertices 3, 7: 4 connections

2. Relabel the vertices according to their connections (starting from 0):
   - Vertex 5: 0 connections -> New label 0
   - Vertices 0, 1, 4, 8: 2 connections -> New labels 1, 2, 3, 4
   - Vertices 2, 6, 9: 3 connections -> New labels 5, 6, 7
   - Vertices 3, 7: 4 connections -> New labels 8, 9

3. Process the edges in the order given in the question (only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections):
   - (0, 4): Check shared connections -> None
   - (0, 9): Check shared connections -> None
   - (1, 6): Check shared connections -> None
   - (1, 8): Check shared connections -> None
   - (2, 3): Check shared connections -> None
   - (2, 7): Check shared connections -> None
   - (3, 2): Process as 2 < 3
   - (3, 9): Process as 3 < 9 -> Triangle <2, 3, 9>
   - (4, 0): Process as 0 < 4
   - (6, 1): Process as 1 < 6
   - (6, 7): Check shared connections -> None
   - (6, 8): Process as 6 < 8
   - (7, 2): Process as 2 < 7
   - (7, 6): Process as 6 < 7
   - (7, 9): Process as 7 < 9 -> Triangle <6, 7, 9>
   - (8, 1): Process as 1 < 8
   - (8, 6): Process as 6 < 8
   - (9, 0): Process as 0 < 9
   - (9, 3): Process as 3 < 9
   - (9, 7): Process as 7 < 9

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <2, 3, 9>, <6, 7, 9>
