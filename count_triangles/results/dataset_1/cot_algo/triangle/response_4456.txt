Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we get the following relabeling: 

Vertices: 
0 (degree 2) 
1 (degree 1) 
3 (degree 2) 
5 (degree 3) 
6 (degree 2) 
8 (degree 3) 
9 (degree 2) 
2 (degree 4) 
4 (degree 5) 
7 (degree 6) 

Now, we will check each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Checking (0, 4): 
Node 0 is connected to 2, 4 is connected to 6, so there is a triangle <0, 4, 6>. 

Checking (0, 9): 
Node 0 is connected to 2, 9 is connected to 6, so there is a triangle <0, 9, 2>. 

Checking (1, 9): 
Node 1 is not connected to node 9. 

Checking (2, 4): 
Node 2 is connected to 6 and 7, 4 is connected to 6, so there is a triangle <2, 4, 6>. 

Checking (2, 6): 
Node 2 is connected to 4 and 7, 6 is connected to 4, so there is a triangle <2, 6, 4>. 

Checking (2, 7): 
Node 2 is connected to 4 and 6, 7 is connected to 3 and 8, so no triangle.

Checking (3, 7): 
Node 3 is connected to 8, 7 is connected to 2, 4, and 6, so there is a triangle <3, 7, 4>.

Checking (3, 8): 
Node 3 is connected to 7, 8 is connected to 5, so there is a triangle <3, 8, 7>. 

Checking (4, 0): 
Already processed when checking (0, 4). 

Checking (4, 2): 
Already processed when checking (2, 4). 

Checking (4, 5): 
Node 4 is connected to 6 and 7, 5 is connected to 8, so there is a triangle <4, 5, 8>. 

Checking (4, 7): 
Already processed when checking (3, 7). 

Checking (5, 4): 
Already processed when checking (4, 5).

Checking (5, 8): 
Node 5 is connected to 4 and 9, 8 is connected to 3 and 7, so there is a triangle <5, 8, 7>.

Checking (5, 9): 
Node 5 is connected to 4, 9 is connected to 0 and 1, so there is a triangle <5, 9, 0>.

Checking (6, 2):
Already processed when checking (2, 6).

Checking (6, 7): 
Already processed when checking (3, 7).

Checking (7, 2): 
Already processed when checking (2, 7).

Checking (7, 3): 
Already processed when checking (3, 7).

Checking (7, 4): 
Already processed when checking (3, 7).

Checking (7, 6): 
Already processed when checking (6, 7).

Checking (7, 8): 
Already processed when checking (3, 8).

Checking (8, 3): 
Already processed when checking (3, 8).

Checking (8, 5): 
Already processed when checking (5, 8).

Checking (8, 7): 
Already processed when checking (3, 8).

Checking (9, 0): 
Already processed when checking (0, 9).

Checking (9, 1): 
Node 9 is connected to 5, 1 is not connected to 5.

Checking (9, 5): 
Already processed when checking (5, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles is: [10].

Unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 9, 2>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 7, 4>
<3, 8, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 9, 0>
