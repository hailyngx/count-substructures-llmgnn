Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
4: 6 connections
8: 6 connections

Relabeled vertices:
2: 0 connections
3: 0 connections
6: 1 connection
8: 1 connection
0: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
4: 3 connections

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph, checking only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
<0, 4, 8>
