Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 

Vertex 0: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 5
Vertex 9: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 6: Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

1. Checking edge (0, 2): Both have degree less than 5, shared connection with vertex 6 => Triangle <0, 2, 6>
2. Checking edge (0, 6): Both have degree less than 6, shared connection with vertices 5 and 9 => Triangles <0, 2, 5> and <0, 2, 9>
3. Checking edge (1, 3): Both have degree less than 5, shared connection with vertex 2 => Triangle <1, 3, 2>
4. Checking edge (1, 4): Both have degree less than 5, shared connection with vertex 8 => Triangle <1, 4, 8>
5. Checking edge (1, 8): Both have degree less than 5, shared connection with vertex 4, also shared connection with 9 => Triangles <1, 8, 4> and <1, 8, 9>
6. Checking edge (1, 9): Both have degree less than 6, shared connection with vertices 4, 8 => Triangles <1, 9, 4> and <1, 9, 8>
7. Checking edge (2, 3): Both have degree less than 5, shared connection with vertex 1 => Triangle <2, 3, 1>
8. Checking edge (2, 8): Both have degree less than 6, shared connection with vertices 1, 4 => Triangles <2, 8, 1> and <2, 8, 4>
9. Checking edge (4, 8): Both have degree less than 6, shared connection with vertices 1, 9 => Triangles <4, 8, 1> and <4, 8, 9>
10. Checking edge (5, 6): Both have degree less than 6, shared connection with vertices 0, 9 => Triangles <5, 6, 0> and <5, 6, 9>
11. Checking edge (6, 7): Both have degree less than 6, shared connection with vertices 5, 9 => Triangles <6, 7, 5> and <6, 7, 9>
12. Checking edge (6, 8): Both have degree less than 7, shared connection with vertices 1, 2, 4, 9 => Triangles <6, 8, 1>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 8, 4>, <6, 8, 9>
13. Checking edge (6, 9): Both have degree less than 7, shared connection with vertices 0, 2, 5, 7, 8 => Triangles <6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 2>, <6, 9, 5>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 9, 8>
14. Checking edge (7, 9): Both have degree less than 6, shared connection with vertices 5, 6 => Triangles <7, 9, 5>, <7, 9, 6>
15. Checking edge (8, 9): Both have degree less than 7, shared connection with vertices 1, 4, 6 => Triangles <8, 9, 1>, <8, 9, 4>, <8, 9, 6>

Total number of triangles: [28]
