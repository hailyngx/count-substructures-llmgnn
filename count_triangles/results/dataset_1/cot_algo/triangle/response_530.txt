Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their degree:
Node 4: degree 5
Node 2: degree 4
Node 0: degree 6
Node 6: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
