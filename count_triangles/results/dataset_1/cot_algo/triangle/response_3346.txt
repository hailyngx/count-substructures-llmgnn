Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Node 4: 0 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

We will start by examining the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
Checking the edges accordingly:
Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 1, 9.
Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle.
Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle.
Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 9>
