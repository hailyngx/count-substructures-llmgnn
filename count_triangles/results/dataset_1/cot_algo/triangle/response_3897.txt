Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:  

| Vertex | Degree |  
|--------|--------|  
|   1    |   1    |  
|   3    |   1    |  
|   1    |   2    |    
|   3    |   2    |  
|   6    |   2    |  
|   8    |   2    |  
|   1    |   3    |    
|   3    |   3    |  
|   6    |   3    |  
|   8    |   3    |  
|   1    |   1    |    
|   3    |   1    |  
|   2    |   4    |    
|   5    |   4    |  
|   4    |   5    |  
|   7    |   5    |  
|   9    |   5    |  

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:  

Number of triangles: [6]  
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 9, 6>, <2, 8, 6>
