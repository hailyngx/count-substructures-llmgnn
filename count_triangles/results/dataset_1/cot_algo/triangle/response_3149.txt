Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The degrees of the vertices in this graph are:
- Vertex 0: degree 5
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 3
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 1

Now, relabel the vertices in ascending order of their degrees:
- Vertex 3 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 9 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 2 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 5 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 7 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 1 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 4 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 6 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 8 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 0 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 9

Now, we will check the edges following the rule that only edges starting from vertices with smaller labels are considered:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 2, 4>
- <6, 7, 8>

Counting the unique triangles, we find that there are 9 triangles in total: [9].
