Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 0: degree 5  
Vertex 1: degree 5  
Vertex 2: degree 4  
Vertex 3: degree 3  
Vertex 4: degree 4  
Vertex 5: degree 2  
Vertex 6: degree 2  
Vertex 7: degree 2  
Vertex 8: degree 2  
Vertex 9: degree 6  

Based on the new vertex labels, we can proceed to count the number of triangles by looking at each edge and checking for shared connections.  

The total number of triangles is [18].  

Unique triangles found:  
<0, 1, 4>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 9, 1>  
<1, 2, 4>  
<1, 2, 9>  
<1, 4, 9>  
<1, 6, 9>  
<2, 0, 4>  
<2, 3, 0>  
<3, 5, 7>  
<4, 0, 9>  
<4, 1, 9>  
<4, 9, 6>  
<5, 3, 7>  
<7, 5, 8>  
<9, 1, 6>  
<9, 4, 6>
