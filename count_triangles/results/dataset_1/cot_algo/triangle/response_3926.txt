Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
Vertex 0 has 2 connections
Vertex 1 has 2 connections
Vertex 4 has 2 connections
Vertex 6 has 3 connections
Vertex 8 has 3 connections
Vertex 5 has 4 connections
Vertex 7 has 4 connections
Vertex 3 has 5 connections
Vertex 9 has 5 connections
Vertex 2 has 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles by considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Calculating the number of triangles may take some time. Let's begin:
