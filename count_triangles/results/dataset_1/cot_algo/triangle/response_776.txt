Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0: 4, 6, 9
1: 2
2: 1, 6, 7, 8
3: 5, 7, 8
4: 0, 6, 7, 8
5: 3, 8, 9
6: 0, 2, 4, 7
7: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
8: 2, 3, 4, 5
9: 0, 5, 7
```

According to the Degree-Based Ordering method, we label the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most:
```
1: 0
2: 1, 6, 9
3: 2, 3, 5
4: 4, 8
5: 7
```

Now, we will find triangles by checking shared connections between vertices starting from lower labeled vertices to higher labeled vertices.

Total number of triangles: [16]

Unique triangles:
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 2>
<4, 8, 3>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 8, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 5>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 9, 5>
