Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 1 connection.
Node 8 has 5 connections.
Node 9 has 1 connection.

The nodes sorted by their number of connections are: 7, 9, 4, 5, 0, 6, 3, 1, 8, 2.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and examining the edges accordingly:

- When looking at node 7: No triangles.
- When looking at node 9: No triangles.
- When looking at node 4: No triangles.
- When looking at node 5: No triangles.
- When looking at node 0: Triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- When looking at node 6: Triangles <2, 3, 6> and <2, 5, 6>.
- When looking at node 3: No additional triangles.
- When looking at node 1: No additional triangles.
- When looking at node 8: Triangle <2, 8, 4>.
- When looking at node 2: Triangle <2, 8, 4>.

Count of triangles inside brackets []: [5]
Unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 3>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 8, 4>
