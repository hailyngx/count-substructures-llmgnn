Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding degrees are:
Vertex 0 (degree 3)
Vertex 1 (degree 3)
Vertex 2 (degree 3)
Vertex 3 (degree 2)
Vertex 4 (degree 3)
Vertex 5 (degree 5)
Vertex 6 (degree 3)
Vertex 7 (degree 4)
Vertex 8 (degree 5)
Vertex 9 (degree 3)

Reordering the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertex 3 (degree 2)
Vertex 0 (degree 3)
Vertex 1 (degree 3)
Vertex 2 (degree 3)
Vertex 4 (degree 3)
Vertex 6 (degree 3)
Vertex 9 (degree 3)
Vertex 7 (degree 4)
Vertex 5 (degree 5)
Vertex 8 (degree 5)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Triangles:
1. <2, 4, 5>
2. <2, 5, 8>
3. <2, 5, 9>
4. <4, 5, 8>
5. <4, 5, 9>
6. <5, 7, 8>
7. <5, 8, 1>
8. <5, 8, 3>
9. <5, 8, 6>
10. <5, 8, 7>
11. <5, 8, 9>
12. <5, 9, 0>

There are 12 triangles in total. Therefore, the output is:
