Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
- Vertex 2 is connected to 1 other vertex.
- Vertices 3, 4, and 7 are connected to 1 other vertex each.
- Vertex 8 is connected to 1 other vertex.
- Vertices 1 and 6 are connected to 2 other vertices each.
- Vertices 0 and 3 are connected to 3 other vertices each.
- Vertex 5 is connected to 5 other vertices.
- Vertex 9 is connected to 7 other vertices.

We will relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Vertex 2 -> A
- Vertex 3 -> B
- Vertex 4 -> C
- Vertex 7 -> D
- Vertex 8 -> E
- Vertex 1 -> F
- Vertex 6 -> G
- Vertex 0 -> H
- Vertex 5 -> I
- Vertex 9 -> J

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- (A, G) - No triangle
- (B, D) - No triangle
- (C, J) - No triangle
- (E, J) - No triangle
- (F, I) - No triangle
- (H, J) - No triangle
- (I, J) - <0, 5, 9>
- (I, J) - No triangle
- (I, G) - <5, 6, 9>
- (G, I) - No triangle
- (J, I) - No triangle
- (J, I) - No triangle
- (J, I) - No triangle
- (J, I) - No triangle
- (J, F) - <1, 5, 9>
- (I, F) - No triangle
- (J, H) - <0, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
