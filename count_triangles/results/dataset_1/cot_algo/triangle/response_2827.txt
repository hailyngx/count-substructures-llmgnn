Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on the number of connections:

Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections

We relabel the vertices according to this order:

Vertex 1 (Degree 3) -> Vertex A
Vertex 3 (Degree 3) -> Vertex B
Vertex 6 (Degree 3) -> Vertex C
Vertex 4 (Degree 3) -> Vertex D
Vertex 7 (Degree 3) -> Vertex E
Vertex 9 (Degree 3) -> Vertex F
Vertex 2 (Degree 4) -> Vertex G
Vertex 5 (Degree 4) -> Vertex H
Vertex 8 (Degree 4) -> Vertex I

Now, we consider each edge in the graph where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (1, 6) - Check shared connections of Vertex A and Vertex C:
   - Shared connections: None

2. Edge (1, 7) - Check shared connections of Vertex A and Vertex E:
   - Shared connections: None

3. Edge (1, 9) - Check shared connections of Vertex A and Vertex F:
   - Shared connections: None

4. Edge (2, 3) - Skipped (Vertex B has more connections than Vertex G)

5. Edge (2, 5) - Check shared connections of Vertex G and Vertex H:
   - Shared connections: None

6. Edge (2, 8) - Check shared connections of Vertex G and Vertex I:
   - Shared connections: None

7. Edge (2, 9) - Skipped (Vertex F has more connections than Vertex G)

8. Edge (3, 6) - Check shared connections of Vertex B and Vertex C:
   - Shared connections: None

9. Edge (3, 8) - Skipped (Vertex I has more connections than Vertex B)

10. Edge (4, 5) - Check shared connections of Vertex D and Vertex H:
    - Shared connections: None

11. Edge (4, 7) - Check shared connections of Vertex D and Vertex E:
    - Shared connections: None

12. Edge (4, 8) - Skipped (Vertex I has more connections than Vertex D)

13. Edge (5, 7) - Check shared connections of Vertex H and Vertex E:
    - Shared connections: None

14. Edge (5, 9) - Skipped (Vertex F has more connections than Vertex H)

15. Edge (6, 8) - Skipped (Vertex I has more connections than Vertex C)

16. Edge (7, 1) - Skipped (Vertex A has more connections than Vertex E)

17. Edge (8, 2) - Skipped (Vertex G has more connections than Vertex I)

18. Edge (9, 1) - Skipped (Vertex A has more connections than Vertex F)

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
