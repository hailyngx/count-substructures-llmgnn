Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections). Here is the updated list of vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: 
1. Vertex 5 (Degree 2)
2. Vertex 4 (Degree 1)
3. Vertex 6 (Degree 1)
4. Vertex 2 (Degree 3)
5. Vertex 7 (Degree 3)
6. Vertex 9 (Degree 3)
7. Vertex 1 (Degree 4)
8. Vertex 8 (Degree 4)
9. Vertex 0 (Degree 5)
10. Vertex 3 (Degree 6)

Based on the degree ordering, we will now analyze the edges:

1. Edge (1, 2): Both vertices have degree < 3, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
2. Edge (4, 2): Both vertices have degree < 3, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
3. Edge (2, 1): Both vertices have degree < 4, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
4. Edge (6, 3): Both vertices have degree < 4, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
5. Edge (5, 7): Both vertices have degree < 4, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
6. Edge (7, 0): Both vertices have degree < 5, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
7. Edge (9, 5): Both vertices have degree < 5, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
8. Edge (8, 0): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
9. Edge (8, 1): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
10. Edge (8, 3): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: Vertex 1 forms a triangle.
11. Edge (0, 3): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: Vertex 1 forms a triangle.
12. Edge (0, 7): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
13. Edge (0, 8): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
14. Edge (0, 9): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
15. Edge (1, 3): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: Vertex 2 forms a triangle.
16. Edge (1, 8): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
17. Edge (3, 0): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: Vertex 1 forms a triangle.
18. Edge (3, 1): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: Vertex 2 forms a triangle.
19. Edge (3, 2): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: Vertex 1 forms a triangle.
20. Edge (3, 6): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
21. Edge (3, 8): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.
22. Edge (5, 9): Both vertices have degree < 6, so we proceed. Shared connections: None.

Total number of triangles: [4]
