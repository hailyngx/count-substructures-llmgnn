Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's sort the nodes based on their degree:

0: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 5 connections
8: 1 connection
9: 1 connection

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

For edge (0, 6):
Both nodes have 3 common neighbors (7, 9, 4), so there is 1 triangle: <0, 6, 7>.

For edge (0, 7):
Both nodes have 3 common neighbors (6, 5, 2), so there is 1 triangle: <0, 7, 6>.

For edge (0, 9):
Both nodes have 0 common neighbors, so there are no triangles formed.

For edge (1, 3):
Node 1 has 3 common neighbors with node 2, so there is 1 triangle: <1, 3, 2>.

For edge (1, 4):
Both nodes have 1 common neighbor (5), so there are no triangles formed.

For edge (1, 5):
Both nodes have 2 common neighbors (3, 7), so there is 1 triangle: <1, 5, 3>.

For edge (2, 3):
Both nodes have 3 common neighbors (1, 5, 7), so there is 1 triangle: <2, 3, 1>.

For edge (2, 7):
Node 2 has 2 common neighbors with each of 0, 3, so there are 2 triangles: <2, 7, 0>, <2, 7, 3>.

For edge (2, 8):
Both nodes have 0 connections, so there are no triangles formed.

For edge (3, 1):
Node 1 has 3 common neighbors with node 2, so there is 1 triangle: <3, 1, 2>.

For edge (3, 2):
Both nodes have 3 common neighbors (1, 5, 7), so there is 1 triangle: <3, 2, 1>.

For edge (3, 5):
Both nodes have 2 common neighbors (1, 7), so there is 1 triangle: <3, 5, 1>.

For edge (3, 7):
Node 3 has 2 common neighbors with each of 0, 2, 5, so there are 3 triangles: <3, 7, 0>, <3, 7, 2>, <3, 7, 5>.

For edge (4, 1):
Both nodes have 1 common neighbor (5), so there are no triangles formed.

For edge (4, 6):
Both nodes have 1 common neighbor (0), so there are no triangles formed.

For edge (5, 1):
Both nodes have 2 common neighbors (3, 7), so there is 1 triangle: <5, 1, 3>.

For edge (5, 3):
Both nodes have 2 common neighbors (1, 7), so there is 1 triangle: <5, 3, 1>.

For edge (5, 7):
Node 5 has 2 common neighbors with each of 1, 3, so there are 2 triangles: <5, 7, 1>, <5, 7, 3>.

For edge (6, 0):
Both nodes have 3 common neighbors (7, 9, 4), so there is 1 triangle: <6, 0, 7>.

For edge (6, 4):
Both nodes have 1 common neighbor (0), so there are no triangles formed.

For edge (6, 7):
Node 6 has 2 common neighbors with each of 0, 3, so there are 2 triangles: <6, 7, 0>, <6, 7, 3>.

For edge (7, 0):
Both nodes have 3 common neighbors (6, 5, 2), so there is 1 triangle: <7, 0, 6>.

For edge (7, 2):
Node 7 has 2 common neighbors with each of 0, 3, 5, so there are 3 triangles: <7, 2, 0>, <7, 2, 3>, <7, 2, 5>.

For edge (7, 3):
Node 7 has 2 common neighbors with each of 0, 2, 5, so there are 3 triangles: <7, 3, 0>, <7, 3, 2>, <7, 3, 5>.

For edge (7, 5):
Node 7 has 2 common neighbors with each of 1, 3, so there are 2 triangles: <7, 5, 1>, <7, 5, 3>.

For edge (7, 6):
Node 7 has 2 common neighbors with each of 0, 3, so there are 2 triangles: <7, 6, 0>, <7, 6, 3>.

For edge (8, 2):
Both nodes have 0 connections, so there are no triangles formed.

For edge (9, 0):
Both nodes have 0 connections, so there are no triangles formed.

The total number of triangles is [17].
