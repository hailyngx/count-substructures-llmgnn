Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees from least to most, the new numbering is as follows:
Node 0 -> Degree 3
Node 2 -> Degree 2
Node 4 -> Degree 2
Node 6 -> Degree 4
Node 9 -> Degree 2
Node 5 -> Degree 5
Node 7 -> Degree 4
Node 1 -> Degree 5
Node 8 -> Degree 5
Node 3 -> Degree 6

By only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles in this graph.

We find that there are 13 triangles in this graph:

[13]

And the unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
