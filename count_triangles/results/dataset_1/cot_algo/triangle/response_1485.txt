Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling will be:
Node 5 - degree 1
Node 6 - degree 1
Node 7 - degree 1
Node 0 - degree 2
Node 7 - degree 2
Node 9 - degree 2
Node 1 - degree 4
Node 3 - degree 4
Node 4 - degree 4
Node 8 - degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 8), (2, 9), (5, 7), (6, 8)

From these edges, we find the following triangles:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 8, 4>

Hence, the total number of triangles is [4].
