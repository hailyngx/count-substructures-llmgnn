Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 6
- Node 6 has degree 6

Next, we can relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 0 (degree 2) becomes Node 0
- Node 1 (degree 2) becomes Node 1
- Node 3 (degree 1) becomes Node 2
- Node 4 (degree 1) becomes Node 3
- Node 7 (degree 1) becomes Node 4
- Node 8 (degree 1) becomes Node 5
- Node 5 (degree 3) becomes Node 6
- Node 2 (degree 3) becomes Node 7
- Node 9 (degree 6) becomes Node 8
- Node 6 (degree 6) becomes Node 9

With the relabeled nodes, we can now analyze the edges:

- Edge (0, 9) becomes (0, 8)
- Edge (1, 4) does not proceed as both nodes have the same degree
- Edge (1, 6) does not proceed as Node 1 has a higher degree than Node 6
- Edge (2, 5) becomes (7, 6)
- Edge (2, 6) does not proceed as Node 2 (now Node 7) has a higher degree than Node 6 (now Node 9)
- Edge (3, 6) does not proceed as Node 2 (now Node 7) has a higher degree than Node 6 (now Node 9)
- Edge (4, 1) does not proceed as both nodes have the same degree
- Edge (5, 2) becomes (6, 7)
- Edge (5, 9) does not proceed as Node 5 (now Node 6) has a higher degree than Node 9 (now Node 8)
- Edge (6, 1) does not proceed as Node 1 has a higher degree than Node 6
- Edge (6, 2) does not proceed as Node 2 (now Node 7) has a higher degree than Node 6 (now Node 9)
- Edge (6, 3) does not proceed as Node 2 (now Node 7) has a higher degree than Node 6 (now Node 9)
- Edge (6, 7) does not proceed as both nodes have the same degree
- Edge (6, 9) does not proceed as both nodes have the same degree
- Edge (7, 6) does not proceed as both nodes have the same degree
- Edge (8, 9) becomes (5, 8)
- Edge (9, 0) does not proceed as both nodes have the same degree
- Edge (9, 5) does not proceed as Node 5 (now Node 6) has a higher degree than Node 9 (now Node 8)
- Edge (9, 6) does not proceed as both nodes have the same degree

Based on the above analysis, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 6, 8>
- <8, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
