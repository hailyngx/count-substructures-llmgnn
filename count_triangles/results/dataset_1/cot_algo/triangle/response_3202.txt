Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 0 has 3 connections
Vertex 1 has 2 connections
Vertex 3 has 2 connections
Vertex 6 has 1 connection
Vertex 8 has 2 connections
Vertex 5 has 3 connections
Vertex 9 has 5 connections
Vertex 2 has 4 connections
Vertex 4 has 4 connections
Vertex 7 has 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on this ordering:

Vertex 0 (1 connection)
Vertex 1 (2 connections)
Vertex 3 (2 connections)
Vertex 6 (1 connection)
Vertex 8 (2 connections)
Vertex 5 (3 connections)
Vertex 2 (4 connections)
Vertex 4 (4 connections)
Vertex 7 (4 connections)
Vertex 9 (5 connections)

Next, we will count the triangles:

1. For edge (1, 0), vertex 0 has 1 connection and vertex 1 has 2 connections. So, we check for shared connections and find a triangle with vertex 0, vertex 1, and one of their shared connections.
2. For edge (0, 4), vertex 0 has 1 connection and vertex 4 has 4 connections. We find a triangle with vertex 0, vertex 4, and one of their shared connections.
3. For edge (0, 9), vertex 0 has 1 connection and vertex 9 has 5 connections. We find a triangle with vertex 0, vertex 9, and one of their shared connections.
4. For edge (1, 2), vertex 1 and vertex 2 both have 2 connections, we skip this edge.
5. For edge (3, 2), vertex 3 has 2 connections and vertex 2 has 4 connections. We find a triangle with vertex 3, vertex 2, and one of their shared connections.
6. For edge (3, 7), vertex 3 has 2 connections and vertex 7 has 4 connections. We find a triangle with vertex 3, vertex 7, and one of their shared connections.
7. For edge (6, 9), vertex 6 has 1 connection and vertex 9 has 5 connections. We find a triangle with vertex 6, vertex 9, and one of their shared connections.
8. For edge (5, 7), vertex 5 has 3 connections and vertex 7 has 4 connections. We find a triangle with vertex 5, vertex 7, and one of their shared connections.
9. For edge (8, 5), vertex 8 has 2 connections and vertex 5 has 3 connections. We find a triangle with vertex 8, vertex 5, and one of their shared connections.

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 2>
