Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 4 has 1 connection
Node 9 has 1 connection
Nodes 5 and 6 have 2 connections
Nodes 2 and 4 have 3 connections
Nodes 1 and 3 have 4 connections
Nodes 7 and 9 have 5 connections
Node 0 has 6 connections
Node 8 has 7 connections

Next, we will proceed with counting the triangles by examining the edges:

1. Edge: (0, 3)
Node 0 has connections with nodes 3, 8, and 9.
Node 3 has connections with nodes 0 and 1.
Shared connection: Node 3
