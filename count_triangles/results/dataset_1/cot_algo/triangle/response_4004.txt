Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 4: 0 connections
Node 8: 0 connections
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 7, 9>
