Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree of connectivity, the new labeling of the vertices is: 3, 6, 2, 0, 1, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9.

Now, to count the number of triangles in the graph:

- Edge (0, 3) is skipped since both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <0, 4, 5>.
- Edge (0, 7) is skipped since vertex 0 has higher degree than vertex 7.
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <1, 4, 7>.
- Edge (1, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <1, 4, 8>.
- Edge (2, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <2, 4, 7>.
- Edge (3, 0) is skipped since both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (3, 8) is skipped since vertex 3 has higher degree than vertex 8.
- Edge (4, 5) is skipped since both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (4, 6) is skipped since both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (4, 7) is skipped since both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (4, 8) is skipped since both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 7: <4, 7, 9>.
- Edge (5, 0) is skipped since vertex 5 has higher degree than vertex 0.
- Edge (5, 4) is skipped since both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (5, 6) is skipped since both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (6, 4) is skipped since both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (6, 5) is skipped since vertex 6 has higher degree than vertex 5.
- Edge (7, 0) is skipped since vertex 7 has higher degree than vertex 0.
- Edge (7, 1) is skipped since vertex 7 has higher degree than vertex 1.
- Edge (7, 2) is skipped since vertex 7 has higher degree than vertex 2.
- Edge (7, 4) is skipped since both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (7, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <7, 4, 9>.
- Edge (8, 1) is skipped since vertex 8 has higher degree than vertex 1.
- Edge (8, 3) is skipped since vertex 8 has higher degree than vertex 3.
- Edge (8, 4) is skipped since both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (9, 4) is skipped since vertex 9 has higher degree than vertex 4.
- Edge (9, 7) is skipped since vertex 9 has higher degree than vertex 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, and <4, 7, 9>.
