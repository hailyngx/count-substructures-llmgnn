Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method consists of first sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: 1 connection  
Node 1: 2 connections  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 6: 2 connections  
Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 5: 5 connections  
Node 2: 5 connections  
Node 9: 6 connections  
Node 4: 10 connections  

Now, let's check for triangles only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles found:  
<0, 1, 4>  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 3, 4>  
<1, 4, 7>  
<2, 4, 5>  
<2, 4, 9>  
<3, 4, 5>  
<4, 5, 7>  
<4, 5, 8>  
<4, 6, 9>  
<4, 7, 9>  
<5, 7, 9>  
<7, 8, 9>  

Total number of triangles: [13]
