Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:

Sorted vertices based on their degree:
0(5), 3(3), 7(2), 5(3), 9(2), 6(4), 1(5), 8(4), 4(5), 2(5)

Edges to be processed:
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 4), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 9)
