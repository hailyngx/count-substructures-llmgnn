Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degrees:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 0 (degree 1) becomes Node 0 (label 0)
Node 1 (degree 1) becomes Node 1 (label 1)
Node 2 (degree 1) becomes Node 2 (label 2)
Node 3 (degree 1) becomes Node 3 (label 3)
Node 4 (degree 3) becomes Node 4 (label 4)
Node 5 (degree 5) becomes Node 5 (label 5)
Node 7 (degree 3) becomes Node 6 (label 6)
Node 8 (degree 2) becomes Node 7 (label 7)
Node 9 (degree 2) becomes Node 8 (label 8)

Now, let's check for triangles based on the degree-based ordering:
- Edge (0, 5) skipped because Node 0 (label 0) has fewer connections than Node 5 (label 5).
- Edge (1, 8) skipped because Node 1 (label 1) has fewer connections than Node 8 (label 7).
- Edge (2, 7) skipped because Node 2 (label 2) has fewer connections than Node 7 (label 6).
- Edge (3, 9) skipped because Node 3 (label 3) has fewer connections than Node 9 (label 8).
- Edge (4, 5) skipped because although Node 4 (label 4) has fewer connections, it's the higher labeled node.
- Edge (4, 7) skipped because although Node 4 (label 4) has fewer connections, it's the higher labeled node.
- Edge (5, 0) forms a triangle with Node 0, Node 5, and Node 4. Triangle: <0, 4, 5>
- Edge (5, 4) forms a triangle with Node 4, Node 5, and Node 7. Triangle: <4, 5, 7>
- Edge (5, 8) forms a triangle with Node 5, Node 8, and Node 1. Triangle: <1, 5, 7>
- Edge (5, 9) forms a triangle with Node 5, Node 9, and Node 3. Triangle: <3, 5, 7>
- Edge (7, 2) forms a triangle with Node 7, Node 2, and Node 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 7>
- Edge (7, 4) forms a triangle with Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8. Triangle: <4, 7, 8>
- Edge (8, 1) forms a triangle with Node 1, Node 8, and Node 5. Triangle: <1, 5, 7>
- Edge (8, 5) skipped because although Node 8 (label 7) has fewer connections, it's the higher labeled node.
- Edge (9, 3) forms a triangle with Node 9, Node 3, and Node 8. Triangle: <3, 8, 9>
- Edge (9, 5) forms a triangle with Node 5, Node 9, and Node 4. Triangle: <4, 5, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
