Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertices: 4, 0, 3, 2, 8, 6, 9, 7, 5, 1

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
