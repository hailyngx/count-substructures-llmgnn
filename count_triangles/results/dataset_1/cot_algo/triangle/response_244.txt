Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 1
Node 5 has degree 1
Node 8 has degree 1
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze each edge to count the number of triangles. 

For the edge (0, 2):
Node 0 and Node 2 share Node 3 as a common connection, forming a triangle <0, 2, 3>.

For the edge (0, 3):
Node 0 and Node 3 share Node 1 as a common connection, forming a triangle <0, 3, 1>.

For the edge (0, 6):
Node 0 and Node 6 do not form a triangle as per the method.

For the edge (1, 3):
Node 1 and Node 3 do not form a triangle as per the method.

For the edge (1, 5):
Node 1 and Node 5 do not form a triangle as per the method.

For the edge (1, 6):
Node 1 and Node 6 do not form a triangle as per the method.

For the edge (1, 7):
Node 1 and Node 7 share Node 2 as a common connection, forming a triangle <1, 7, 2>.

For the edge (1, 8):
Node 1 and Node 8 do not form a triangle as per the method.

For the edge (2, 4):
Node 2 and Node 4 do not form a triangle as per the method.

For the edge (2, 7):
Node 2 and Node 7 do not form a triangle as per the method.

For the edge (3, 7):
Node 3 and Node 7 do not form a triangle as per the method.

The total number of triangles is [2]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3> and <1, 7, 2>.
