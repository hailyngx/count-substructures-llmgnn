Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Initially, let's sort the vertices by their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degrees:
0 (degree 2)
3 (degree 2)
7 (degree 2)
4 (degree 2)
6 (degree 2)
5 (degree 2)
1 (degree 3)
8 (degree 3)
9 (degree 4)
2 (degree 4)

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degree-based ordering:

Vertices with new labels:
0 -> 0
3 -> 1
7 -> 2
4 -> 3
6 -> 4
5 -> 5
1 -> 6
8 -> 7
9 -> 8
2 -> 9

Next, we will list the edges that satisfy the condition where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Edges to consider:
(0, 7) - Both 0 and 7 have degree 2.
(0, 8) - Both 0 and 8 have degree 2.
(1, 2) - 1 has fewer connections than 2.
(1, 5) - 1 has fewer connections than 5.
(1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 have degree 3.
(2, 4) - 2 has fewer connections than 4.
(2, 9) - Both 2 and 9 have degree 4.
(3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 have degree 2.
(3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 have degree 3.
(4, 6) - 4 has fewer connections than 6.
(7, 9) - 7 has fewer connections than 9.

Now, we will count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge:

Triangles:
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 5, 3>
<5, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
