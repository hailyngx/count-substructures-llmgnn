Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Node 0 has 3 connections
- Node 1 has 4 connections
- Node 2 has 2 connections
- Node 3 has 4 connections
- Node 4 has 1 connection
- Node 5 has 5 connections
- Node 6 has 1 connection
- Node 7 has 5 connections
- Node 8 has 4 connections
- Node 9 has 1 connection

Based on the degree-based ordering, the new labeling of nodes will be:
Node 4 (degree 1) -> Node 6 (degree 1) -> Node 9 (degree 1) -> Node 2 (degree 2) -> Node 0 (degree 3) -> Node 3 (degree 4) -> Node 8 (degree 4) -> Node 1 (degree 4) -> Node 5 (degree 5) -> Node 7 (degree 5)

Now, we will go through the edges and find any triangles formed:
- (0, 1) forms a triangle with 3
- (0, 3) does not form a triangle
- (0, 5) does not form a triangle
- (1, 6) does not form a triangle
- (1, 7) forms a triangle with 3
- (1, 8) does not form a triangle
- (2, 5) does not form a triangle
- (3, 5) forms a triangle with 7
- (3, 7) does not form a triangle
- (3, 8) does not form a triangle
- (5, 7) forms a triangle with 0
- (5, 8) does not form a triangle
- (7, 9) does not form a triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3> and <0, 3, 5>.
