Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees, we get the following labels for the vertices:
Node 4: 1 connection 
Nodes 0, 9: 2 connections
Nodes 2, 8: 3 connections
Nodes 1, 7: 6 connections
Nodes 3, 6: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we observe the following triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<6, 7, 8>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
