Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the number of connections each vertex has:

- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 3 connections

Sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we get the following ordered list of vertices:

2, 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 5, 3

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed by that edge:

- Edge (0, 5): Vertices 0 and 5 have 2 shared connections (3, 9), forming a triangle: <0, 3, 5>.
- Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has 2 shared connections with vertex 5, forming a triangle: <0, 5, 9>.
- Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 5): Vertices 3 and 5 have 2 shared connections (0, 7), forming a triangle: <3, 0, 5>.
- Edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 7): Vertices 5 and 7 have 2 shared connections (0, 8), forming a triangle: <5, 0, 7>.
- Edge (5, 8): Vertices 5 and 8 have 2 shared connections (0, 7), forming a triangle: <5, 0, 8>.
- Edge (6, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 5): vertices 7 and 5 have 2 shared connections (0, 8), forming a triangle: <7, 0, 5>.
- Edge (7, 8): vertices 7 and 8 have 2 shared connections (0, 5), forming a triangle: <7, 0, 8>.
- Edge (8, 5): vertices 8 and 5 have 2 shared connections (0, 7), forming a triangle: <8, 0, 5>.
- Edge (8, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 7): vertices 8 and 7 have 2 shared connections (0, 5), forming a triangle: <8, 0, 7>.
- Edge (9, 0): Vertex 9 has 2 shared connections with vertex 5, forming a triangle: <9, 5, 0>.
- Edge (9, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <7, 0, 5>, <7, 0, 8>, <8, 0, 5>, <8, 0, 7>, <9, 5, 0>.
