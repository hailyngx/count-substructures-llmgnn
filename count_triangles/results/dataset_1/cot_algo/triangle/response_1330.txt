Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Starting with the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Relabeling the nodes:
Node 3 -> 0
Node 8 -> 1
Node 2 -> 2
Node 7 -> 3
Node 9 -> 4
Node 6 -> 5
Node 1 -> 6
Node 4 -> 7
Node 8 -> 8
Node 0 -> 9

Checking for triangles:
- (0, 1) -> Node 9 (0) has connections with nodes 1 (6) and 3 (0). Triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- (0, 3) -> No triangles.
- (0, 5) -> Node 9 (0) has connections with nodes 5 (5) and 6 (5). Triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- (0, 6) -> Node 9 (0) has connections with nodes 1 (6) and 6 (5). Triangle <0, 1, 6>.
- (1, 5) -> Node 6 (5) has connections with nodes 5 (5) and 0 (9). Triangle <1, 5, 0>.
- (1, 6) -> No triangles.
- (2, 6) -> No triangles.
- (2, 8) -> No triangles.
- (3, 0) -> No triangles.
- (4, 5) -> Node 9 (4) has connections with nodes 5 (5) and 0 (9). Triangle <4, 5, 0>.
- (4, 8) -> No triangles.
- (4, 9) -> No triangles.
- (5, 0) -> No triangles.
- (5, 1) -> Node 5 (5) has connections with nodes 1 (6) and 0 (9). Triangle <5, 1, 0>.
- (5, 4) -> Node 5 (5) has connections with nodes 4 (7) and 0 (9). Triangle <5, 4, 0>.
- (5, 7) -> No triangles.
- (5, 9) -> No triangles.
- (6, 0) -> No triangles.
- (6, 1) -> No triangles.
- (6, 2) -> No triangles.
- (6, 7) -> No triangles.
- (7, 5) -> No triangles.
- (7, 6) -> No triangles.
- (8, 2) -> No triangles.
- (8, 4) -> No triangles.
- (9, 4) -> No triangles.
- (9, 5) -> No triangles.

Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 1, 6>, <1, 5, 0>, <4, 5, 0>, <5, 1, 0>, <5, 4, 0>
