Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Node 8 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 1, 7, and 8 have 1 connection each.
- Nodes 3, 4, and 6 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 2 and 5 have 3 connections each.
- Node 0 has 5 connections.
  
Analyzing the edges:
- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with node 3: <0, 1, 3>.
- Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with node 2: <0, 3, 2>.
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with node 9: <0, 4, 9>.
- Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with node 2: <0, 6, 2>.
- Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with node 2: <1, 5, 2>.
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5] and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 2>, and <1, 5, 2>.
