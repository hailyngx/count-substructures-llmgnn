Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:

Vertex 4 : 1 connection
Vertex 5 : 1 connection
Vertex 1 : 0 connections
Vertex 9 : 0 connections
Vertex 0 : 3 connections
Vertex 2 : 4 connections
Vertex 6 : 4 connections
Vertex 7 : 4 connections
Vertex 3 : 5 connections
Vertex 8 : 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can find the triangles:

1. (0, 2) and (2, 0) share vertex 0: <0, 2, 6>
2. (0, 6) and (6, 0) share vertex 0: <0, 6, 8>
3. (0, 8) and (8, 0) share vertex 0: <0, 2, 8>
4. (2, 3) and (3, 2) share vertex 2: <2, 3, 7>
5. (3, 5) and (5, 3) share vertex 3: <3, 5, 6>
6. (3, 6) and (6, 3) share vertex 3: <0, 3, 6>
7. (3, 7) and (7, 3) share vertex 3: <0, 3, 7>
8. (3, 8) and (8, 3) share vertex 3: <0, 3, 8>
9. (4, 8) and (8, 4) share vertex 8: <4, 8, 0>
10. (7, 8) and (8, 7) share vertex 8: <0, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <4, 8, 0>, <0, 7, 8>.
