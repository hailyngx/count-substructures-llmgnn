Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices sorted by connections:
1. 1 (connected to 1 node)
2. 5 (connected to 1 node)
3. 9 (connected to 1 node)
4. 2 (connected to 2 nodes)
5. 5 (connected to 2 nodes)
6. 7 (connected to 3 nodes)
7. 4 (connected to 4 nodes)
8. 0 (connected to 6 nodes)
9. 8 (connected to 6 nodes)
10. 6 (connected to 7 nodes)

Next, we will relabel the vertices according to their sorted order:
Label 0: Vertex 1
Label 1: Vertex 5
Label 2: Vertex 9
Label 3: Vertex 2
Label 4: Vertex 5
Label 5: Vertex 7
Label 6: Vertex 4
Label 7: Vertex 0
Label 8: Vertex 8
Label 9: Vertex 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:
Triangles: 
[6]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 4>
