Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 4: 0 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
