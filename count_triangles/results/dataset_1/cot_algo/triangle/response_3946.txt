Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2

Now, we will reorder the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 4: degree 2 -> new label 0
- Node 7: degree 2 -> new label 1
- Node 8: degree 2 -> new label 2
- Node 9: degree 2 -> new label 3
- Node 0: degree 3 -> new label 4
- Node 2: degree 4 -> new label 5
- Node 5: degree 4 -> new label 6
- Node 6: degree 4 -> new label 7
- Node 1: degree 5 -> new label 8

The edges now become:
(0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) 

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle <1, 6, 7>
- Triangle <2, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [6]
