Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling is: <0, 8, 7, 1, 4, 5, 6, 2, 9>. 

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we find:
- Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (0, 5) does not form a triangle since node 0 has fewer connections than node 5.
- Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle since node 0 has fewer connections than node 7.
- Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <1, 5, 0>
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle since node 1 has fewer connections than node 6.
- Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle since node 1 has fewer connections than node 7.
- Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle since node 1 has fewer connections than node 8.
- Edge (2, 0) does not form a triangle since node 0 has fewer connections than node 2.
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle since node 2 has fewer connections than node 4.
- Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle since node 2 has fewer connections than node 5.
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle since node 2 has fewer connections than node 6.
- Edge (2, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <2, 9, 5>
- Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle since node 2 has fewer connections than node 4.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle since node 4 has fewer connections than node 6.
- Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle since node 0 has fewer connections than node 5.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle since node 1 has fewer connections than node 5.
- Edge (5, 2) does not form a triangle since node 2 has fewer connections than node 5.
- Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle since node 9 has fewer connections than node 5.
- Edge (6, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <6, 1, 5>
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle since node 2 has fewer connections than node 6.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle since node 4 has fewer connections than node 6.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle since node 9 has fewer connections than node 6.
- Edge (7, 0) does not form a triangle since node 0 has fewer connections than node 7.
- Edge (7, 1) does not form a triangle since node 1 has fewer connections than node 7.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle since node 7 has fewer connections than node 8.
- Edge (8, 1) does not form a triangle since node 1 has fewer connections than node 8.
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle since node 7 has fewer connections than node 8.
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle since node 9 has fewer connections than node 8.
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle since node 2 has fewer connections than node 9.
- Edge (9, 5) does not form a triangle since node 5 has fewer connections than node 9.
- Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle since node 6 has fewer connections than node 9.

The total number of triangles is [3] inside brackets.
