Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: 2 (3 connections), 4 (1 connection), 5 (2 connections), 7 (4 connections), 8 (1 connection), 9 (1 connection).

Thus, the degree-based ordering is: 4, 8, 9, 5, 2, 7.

Now, we will check the edges in this order to count the triangles:

1. Edge (4, 5): No triangles.
2. Edge (8, 2): No triangles.
3. Edge (9, 7): No triangles.
4. Edge (5, 4): No triangles.
5. Edge (5, 7): Triangle found: <4, 5, 7>.
6. Edge (2, 8): No triangles.
7. Edge (7, 9): No triangles.
8. Edge (2, 7): Triangle found: <2, 5, 7>.

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <4, 5, 7> and <2, 5, 7>.
