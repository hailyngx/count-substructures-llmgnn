Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree of connectivity, we have the following order: (1, 3, 7, 8, 1, 4, 5, 6, 0, 9)

1. Edge (0, 2) can form a triangle with vertex 0 since 0 has connections with 3, 4, and 6 (vertices 1, 4, 5).
2. Edge (0, 3) and edge (3, 0) do not form any triangles.
3. Edge (0, 4) can form a triangle with vertex 4 since 4 has connections with 5 and 6 (vertices 5 and 6).
4. Edge (0, 6) can form a triangle with vertex 6 since 6 has connections with 2 and 5 (vertices 1 and 4).
5. Edge (0, 9) can form a triangle with vertex 9 since 9 has connections with 2 and 7 (vertices 4 and 2).
6. Edge (1, 2) and edge (2, 1) do not form any triangles.
7. Edge (2, 5) can form a triangle with vertex 2 since 2 has connections with 6 and 0 (vertices 4, 1).
8. Edge (2, 6) and edge (6, 2) do not form any triangles.
9. Edge (2, 9) can form a triangle with vertex 2 since 2 has connections with 0 (vertex 1).
10. Edge (3, 0) and edge (0, 3) do not form any triangles.
11. Edge (4, 5) can form a triangle with vertex 5 since 5 has connections with 6 (vertex 6).
12. Edge (4, 8) and edge (8, 4) do not form any triangles.
13. Edge (5, 6) can form a triangle with vertex 6 since 6 has a connection with 0 (vertex 4).
14. Edge (6, 7) can form a triangle with vertex 7 since 7 has a connection with 9 (vertex 2).
15. Edge (7, 9) and edge (9, 7) do not form any triangles.
16. Edge (8, 9) and edge (9, 8) do not form any triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 9, 2>, <2, 5, 6>, and <6, 7, 9>.
