Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 3, 2, 8, 5, 6, 0, 2, 6, 1, 4, 9.
Thus, the labeled graph becomes: (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the triangles and count them.

There are 6 triangles in the graph: [6]
The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 1>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 3>.
