Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph.

The triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
