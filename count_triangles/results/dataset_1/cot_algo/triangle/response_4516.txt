Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node Degrees:
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections

Sorting the nodes by degree:
2, 6, 8, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9

Based on the sorted order, the new labels for the nodes will be:
2 -> 0
6 -> 1
8 -> 2
0 -> 3
1 -> 4
3 -> 5
4 -> 6
5 -> 7
7 -> 8
9 -> 9

Now, we can reevaluate the edges based on the new labels:
(3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) 

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
3. Triangle <3, 6, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
