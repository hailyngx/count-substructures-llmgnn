Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 4 (degree 1)
Node 9 (degree 1)
Node 3 (degree 2)
Node 0 (degree 3)
Node 5 (degree 3)
Node 6 (degree 3)
Node 7 (degree 4)
Node 2 (degree 5)
Node 1 (degree 7)

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can identify the triangles and count them.

The total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles are <1, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 0, 2>, <1, 3, 5>.
