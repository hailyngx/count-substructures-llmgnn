Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0: 1 connection
4: 0 connections
5: 0 connections
1: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
7: 3 connections
9: 2 connections
2: 4 connections
6: 4 connections

Relabeling the vertices accordingly, we have:
0 → 0
4 → 1
5 → 2
1 → 3
3 → 4
8 → 5
7 → 6
9 → 7
2 → 8
6 → 9

Now, counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<7, 5, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
