Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method works as follows:

Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.

Sorted by degree, the new labels for each node will be:
Node 2 - label 0
Node 3 - label 1
Node 0 - label 2
Node 4 - label 3
Node 5 - label 4
Node 6 - label 5
Node 7 - label 6
Node 1 - label 7
Node 8 - label 8
Node 9 - label 9

Using the sorted labels, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This results in the following valid edges:
(2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6)

Now, counting the number of triangles formed by these edges:
1. <3, 4, 7>
2. <3, 7, 8>
3. <4, 0, 2>
4. <4, 0, 5>
5. <7, 2, 9>
6. <7, 8, 1>

Total number of triangles: [6]
