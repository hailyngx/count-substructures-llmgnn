Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. 

The sorted order based on degrees is:
Node 1 (Degree 0)
Node 7 (Degree 1)
Node 5 (Degree 2)
Node 9 (Degree 3)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 4)
Node 2 (Degree 5)
Node 4 (Degree 5)
Node 8 (Degree 5)
Node 0 (Degree 7)

According to the ordering, we will analyze the edges in the graph:
- (0, 3): Forms a triangle with node 6 <0, 3, 6>
- (0, 5): No triangles
- (0, 6): Already counted in the triangle above
- (0, 8): Forms a triangle with node 4 <0, 4, 8>
- (1, 4): No triangles
- (2, 4): No triangles
- (2, 7): No triangles
- (2, 9): No triangles
- (3, 6): Already counted in the triangle above
- (4, 1): No triangles
- (4, 2): No triangles
- (4, 6): Already counted in the triangle above
- (4, 8): Already counted in the triangle above
- (5, 0): No triangles
- (5, 9): No triangles
- (6, 3): Already counted in the triangle above
- (6, 4): Already counted in the triangle above
- (6, 7): No triangles
- (6, 8): Already counted in the triangle above
- (7, 2): No triangles
- (7, 6): No triangles
- (8, 0): No triangles
- (8, 4): Already counted in the triangle above
- (8, 6): Already counted in the triangle above
- (8, 9): No triangles
- (9, 2): No triangles
- (9, 5): No triangles
- (9, 8): No triangles

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 6> and <0, 4, 8>.
