Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). The sorted vertices are: 

Node 5 (Degree 2) 
Node 1 (Degree 2) 
Node 2 (Degree 3) 
Node 8 (Degree 2) 
Node 9 (Degree 4) 
Node 7 (Degree 4) 
Node 6 (Degree 4) 
Node 4 (Degree 4) 
Node 1 (Degree 6) 
Node 0 (Degree 6) 

Edges to consider based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 9), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 6), (7, 3), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Calculating the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 2> (Shared connection: 0)
- Triangle <0, 1, 9> (Shared connection: 0)
- Triangle <0, 2, 3> (Shared connection: 0)
- Triangle <0, 3, 4> (Shared connection: 0)
- Triangle <0, 3, 9> (Shared connection: 0)
- Triangle <2, 3, 7> (Shared connection: 3)
- Triangle <2, 3, 8> (Shared connection: 3)
- Triangle <3, 4, 6> (Shared connection: 4)
- Triangle <5, 6, 9> (Shared connection: 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
