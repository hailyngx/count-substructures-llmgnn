Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph. 

First, we sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Nodes sorted by connections:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Next, we will relabel the nodes according to their sorted order:
Nodes relabelled:
0 -> 0
9 -> 1
2 -> 2
4 -> 3
5 -> 4
6 -> 5
7 -> 6
8 -> 7
1 -> 8
3 -> 9

Now, we will check each edge according to the degree-based ordering and count the triangles formed:

Triangles:
- <1, 7, 8>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <6, 5, 8>

Finally, we count the total number of triangles inside brackets:
