Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new vertex labels are as follows:
Vertex 0 has degree 2
Vertex 1 has degree 1
Vertex 2 has degree 3
Vertex 3 has degree 1
Vertex 4 has degree 2
Vertex 5 has degree 3
Vertex 6 has degree 2
Vertex 7 has degree 2
Vertex 8 has degree 4
Vertex 9 has degree 2

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

- Triangle <5, 8, 9>
- Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
