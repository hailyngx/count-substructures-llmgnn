Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each node:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we relabel the nodes based on their number of connections from least to most:
Node 3 (1 connection) -> relabeled as Node 0
Node 0 (2 connections) -> relabeled as Node 1
Node 4 (2 connections) -> relabeled as Node 2
Node 6 (2 connections) -> relabeled as Node 3
Node 7 (2 connections) -> relabeled as Node 4
Node 8 (3 connections) -> relabeled as Node 5
Node 2 (3 connections) -> relabeled as Node 6
Node 5 (4 connections) -> relabeled as Node 7
Node 1 (4 connections) -> relabeled as Node 8
Node 9 (4 connections) -> relabeled as Node 9

Now, let's list the edges according to the new labels:
(0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 5)

Now, we will count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <2, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 9>
