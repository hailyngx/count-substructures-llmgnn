Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
Node: Connections (Degree)
1: 1, 
3: 1, 
9: 1, 
7: 2, 2: 4, 
5: 2, 
0: 3, 
4: 3, 
8: 4, 
6: 4 

The sorted nodes are: 1, 3, 9, 7, 5, 0, 4, 8, 6, 2 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:
[10] 

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <2, 6, 8>
