Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have the following relabeled vertices:
Vertex 2: 0 connections
Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 9: 0 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles in the graph:
1. Edge (0, 1): Forms triangle with vertices 6 and 8. Triangle: <0, 1, 6>
2. Edge (0, 6): Does not form a triangle as vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 6.
3. Edge (0, 8): Forms triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <0, 1, 8>
4. Edge (0, 9): Does not form a triangle as vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
5. Edge (1, 6): Forms triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <0, 1, 6>
6. Edge (1, 7): Does not form a triangle as both vertices have the same number of connections.
7. Edge (1, 8): Forms triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <0, 1, 8>
8. Edge (2, 4): Does not form a triangle as both vertices have the same number of connections.
9. Edge (3, 4): Does not form a triangle as both vertices have the same number of connections.
10. Edge (3, 5): Does not form a triangle as vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 5.
11. Edge (3, 7): Forms triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 3, 7>
12. Edge (4, 2): Does not form a triangle as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 2.
13. Edge (4, 3): Does not form a triangle as both vertices have the same number of connections.
14. Edge (4, 8): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 1. Triangles: <0, 1, 4> and <0, 4, 8>
15. Edge (5, 3) : Does not form a triangle as vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 5.
16. Edge (5, 8): Does not form a triangle as vertex 5 has fewer connections than vertex 8.
17. Edge (6, 0): Does not form a triangle as both vertices have the same number of connections.
18. Edge (6, 1): Forms triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <0, 1, 6>
19. Edge (6, 7): Forms triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 6, 7>
20. Edge (7, 1): Forms triangle with vertex 3 and vertex 6. Triangles: <1, 3, 7> and <1, 6, 7>
21. Edge (7, 3): Forms triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 3, 7>
22. Edge (7, 6): Forms triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 6, 7>
23. Edge (8, 0): Forms triangle with vertices 1 and 4. Triangles: <0, 1, 8> and <0, 4, 8>
24. Edge (8, 1): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 4. Triangles: <0, 1, 8> and <0, 4, 8>
25. Edge (8, 4): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 1. Triangles: <0, 1, 4> and <0, 4, 8>
26. Edge (8, 5): Does not form a triangle as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 5.
27. Edge (9, 0): Does not form a triangle as vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 9.
