Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 5 connections
- Vertex 3: 5 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will relabel the vertices:
- Vertex 1 → Vertex 0
- Vertex 9 → Vertex 1
- Vertex 4 → Vertex 2
- Vertex 6 → Vertex 3
- Vertex 5 → Vertex 4
- Vertex 0 → Vertex 5
- Vertex 8 → Vertex 6
- Vertex 7 → Vertex 7
- Vertex 2 → Vertex 8
- Vertex 3 → Vertex 9

Now, we will check for triangles using the relabeled vertices:
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 7, 8>
- Triangle <0, 8, 9>
- Triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle <2, 3, 7>
- Triangle <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle <2, 7, 8>
- Triangle <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle <3, 7, 8>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10] in this graph.
