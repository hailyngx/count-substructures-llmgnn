Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most, we get the following relabeling: 
Node 0 has degree 1 
Node 8 has degree 1 
Node 9 has degree 2 
Node 7 has degree 3 
Node 5 has degree 4 
Node 6 has degree 4 
Node 3 has degree 4 
Node 1 has degree 5 
Node 2 has degree 5 
Node 4 has degree 6 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
(0, 4) -> Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 4, proceed. Triangle: <0, 4, 8> 
(1, 3) -> Node 1 has more connections than Node 3, skip. 
(1, 4) -> Node 1 has more connections than Node 4, skip. 
(1, 5) -> Node 1 has more connections than Node 5, skip. 
(1, 7) -> Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 7, proceed. Triangle: <1, 7, 3> 
(1, 9) -> Node 1 has more connections than Node 9, skip. 
(2, 4) -> Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 4, proceed. Triangle: <2, 4, 8> 
(2, 5) -> Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 5, proceed. Triangle: <2, 5, 9> 
(2, 6) -> Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 6, proceed. Triangle: <2, 6, 3> 
(2, 7) -> Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 7, proceed. Triangle: <2, 7, 1> 
(2, 9) -> Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 9, proceed. Triangle: <2, 9, 1> 
(3, 1) -> Node 3 has more connections than Node 1, skip. 
(3, 5) -> Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 5, proceed. Triangle: <3, 5, 9> 
(3, 6) -> Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 6, proceed. Triangle: <3, 6, 2> 
(3, 7) -> Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 7, proceed. Triangle: <3, 7, 1> 
(4, 0) -> Node 4 has more connections than Node 0, skip. 
(4, 1) -> Node 4 has more connections than Node 1, skip. 
(4, 2) -> Node 4 has more connections than Node 2, skip. 
(4, 6) -> Node 4 has more connections than Node 6, skip. 
(4, 8) -> Node 4 has more connections than Node 8, skip. 
(5, 1) -> Node 5 has more connections than Node 1, skip. 
(5, 2) -> Node 5 has more connections than Node 2, skip. 
(5, 3) -> Node 5 has more connections than Node 3, skip. 
(5, 6) -> Node 5 has more connections than Node 6, skip. 
(5, 9) -> Node 5 has more connections than Node 9, skip. 
(6, 2) -> Node 6 has more connections than Node 2, skip. 
(6, 3) -> Node 6 has more connections than Node 3, skip. 
(6, 4) -> Node 6 has more connections than Node 4, skip. 
(6, 5) -> Node 6 has more connections than Node 5, skip. 
(7, 1) - Node 7 has more connections than Node 1, skip. 
(7, 2) - Node 7 has more connections than Node 2, skip. 
(7, 3) - Node 7 has more connections than Node 3, skip. 
(8, 4) - Node 8 has more connections than Node 4, skip. 
(9, 1) - Node 9 has more connections than Node 1, skip. 
(9, 2) - Node 9 has more connections than Node 2, skip. 
(9, 5) - Node 9 has more connections than Node 5, skip. 

The total number of triangles found is 7, and they are: 
<0, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 3>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 7, 1>, <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the output is [7].
