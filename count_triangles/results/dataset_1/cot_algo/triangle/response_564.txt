Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be as follows:  

- Node 0: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 3: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 1
- Node 7: Degree 1

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles present in the graph by examining the edges:

1. (0, 2): No triangle
2. (0, 5): Triangle <0, 5, 9>
3. (0, 9): No triangle
4. (1, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 5>
5. (1, 5): No triangle
6. (1, 7): No triangle
7. (2, 8): No triangle
8. (3, 4): No triangle
9. (3, 6): No triangle
10. (3, 8): Triangle <3, 4, 8>
11. (4, 5): No triangle
12. (5, 9): Triangle <0, 5, 9>
13. (7, 1): No triangle
14. (8, 2): No triangle
15. (8, 3): Triangle <3, 4, 8>
16. (8, 9): Triangle <0, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>.
