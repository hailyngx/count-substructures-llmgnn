Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their degree:
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Edges checked based on degree-based ordering: (1, 8), (4, 9), (8, 1), (7, 0), (0, 7), (2, 0), (3, 0), (8, 3), (9, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 5), (5, 6), (9, 5), (6, 9), (9, 6), (5, 9), (5, 3), (3, 8)

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>
