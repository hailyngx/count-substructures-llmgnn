Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Reorder the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 2 has degree 2  
Vertex 4 has degree 2  
Vertex 3 has degree 1  
Vertex 8 has degree 2  
Vertex 0 has degree 4  
Vertex 5 has degree 4  
Vertex 7 has degree 4  
Vertex 1 has degree 3  
Vertex 6 has degree 4  
Vertex 9 has degree 4  

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

- Check (0, 1): No triangle formed.  
- Check (0, 5): Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>.  
- Check (0, 6): Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>.  
- Check (0, 8): No triangle formed.  
- Check (1, 7): Triangle formed: <1, 5, 7>.  
- Check (1, 9): No triangle formed.  
- Check (2, 3): No triangle formed.  
- Check (2, 4): No triangle formed.  
- Check (2, 9): No triangle formed.  
- Check (3, 2): No triangle formed.  
- Check (4, 2): No triangle formed.  
- Check (5, 6): Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>.  
- Check (5, 7): Triangle formed: <1, 5, 7>.  
- Check (6, 8): No triangle formed.  
- Check (6, 9): Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>.  
- Check (7, 1): Triangle formed: <1, 5, 7>.  
- Check (7, 5): Triangle formed: <1, 5, 7>.  
- Check (7, 9): No triangle formed.  
- Check (8, 0): No triangle formed.  
- Check (8, 6): No triangle formed.  
- Check (9, 1): No triangle formed.  
- Check (9, 2): No triangle formed.  
- Check (9, 6): Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>.  
- Check (9, 7): No triangle formed.  

Total number of triangles: [4]  
Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 9>.
