Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following ordering: (3, 8, 6, 5, 7, 9, 1, 2, 0, 4).

Now, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 4): Shared connections = {5}.
2. Edge (0, 5): Shared connections = {4}.
3. Edge (0, 8): No triangles can be formed.
4. Edge (1, 3): No triangles can be formed.
5. Edge (1, 7): No triangles can be formed.
6. Edge (1, 9): No triangles can be formed.
7. Edge (2, 4): No triangles can be formed.
8. Edge (2, 6): No triangles can be formed.
9. Edge (4, 9): Shared connections = {1}.
10. Edge (4, 7): Shared connections = {1}.
11. Edge (4, 6): Shared connections = {2}.
12. Edge (4, 5): Shared connections = {0}.
13. Edge (4, 0): Shared connections = {8}.
14. Edge (5, 4): Shared connections = {0}.
15. Edge (6, 4): Shared connections = {2}.
16. Edge (7, 4): Shared connections = {1}.
17. Edge (9, 4): Shared connections = {1}.

Total number of triangles = 8
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 4>, <2, 4, 6>.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
