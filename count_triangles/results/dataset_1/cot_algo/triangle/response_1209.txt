Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 3: Degree 1  
Node 1: Degree 2  
Node 6: Degree 2  
Node 9: Degree 2  
Node 5: Degree 3  
Node 0: Degree 4  
Node 4: Degree 4  
Node 8: Degree 5  
Node 7: Degree 6  
Node 2: Degree 6  

Now, we will list the edges based on the sorted labels:

(1, 7) (6, 8) (9, 5)  
(0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) 
(2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9)  
(3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7)  
(5, 9) (5, 6)  
(7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3)  

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the shared connections:

Total number of triangles: [6]  
Unique triangles:  
<0, 4, 7>  
<2, 7, 8>  
<2, 5, 9>  
<2, 7, 8>  
<2, 8, 9>  
<5, 6, 9>
