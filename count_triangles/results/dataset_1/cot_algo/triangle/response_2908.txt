Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, the sorted vertices are as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 1: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 8: degree 6
Node 7: degree 7

Following the method described, we count the triangles and find the following unique triangles:
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 2>
<1, 8, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<7, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
