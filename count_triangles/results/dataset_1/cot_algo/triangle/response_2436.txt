Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling the vertices according to their degree, we get the following sorted list of vertices:
Vertices: [(0, 3), (1, 4), (4, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (5, 5), (6, 4), (3, 6), (2, 5), (9, 7)]

Now, we will count the triangles by looking for shared connections between the endpoints of each edge:

Triangles: 
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9> 
<6, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
