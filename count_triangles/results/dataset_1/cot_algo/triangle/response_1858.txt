Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are as follows:
```
1 -> 9 connections
0 -> 7 connections
2 -> 4 connections
3 -> 2 connections
6 -> 2 connections
5 -> 4 connections
8 -> 4 connections
7 -> 6 connections
4 -> 8 connections
```

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph, only proceeding if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Edges to consider are:
```
(1, 7)
(3, 4)
(3, 6)
(5, 0)
(5, 2)
(5, 4)
(5, 7)
(8, 4)
(8, 7)
(8, 9)
```

After checking for shared connections for each edge, we find the following triangles:
```
<1, 7, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
```

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
