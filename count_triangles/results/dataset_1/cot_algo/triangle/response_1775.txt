Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 8

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Node 0 (degree 1) becomes Node 0
- Node 3 (degree 1) becomes Node 1
- Node 7 (degree 1) becomes Node 2
- Node 8 (degree 1) becomes Node 3
- Node 1 (degree 3) becomes Node 4
- Node 6 (degree 3) becomes Node 5
- Node 5 (degree 4) becomes Node 6
- Node 4 (degree 4) becomes Node 7
- Node 9 (degree 5) becomes Node 8
- Node 2 (degree 8) becomes Node 9

Next, we will check the edges:

For the edge (0, 2), since Node 0 < Node 2 and Node 0 has fewer connections, we proceed to find shared connections. Node 0 and Node 2 have Node 4 as a shared connection, forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.

For the edge (1, 4), Node 4 has more connections than Node 1, so we skip this edge.

For the edge (1, 5), Node 5 has more connections than Node 1, so we skip this edge.

For the edge (1, 6), Node 6 has more connections than Node 1, so we skip this edge.

For the remaining edges, there are no triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 2, 4>.
