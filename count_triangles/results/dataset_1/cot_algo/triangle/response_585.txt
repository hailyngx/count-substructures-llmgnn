Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
6 - 2 connections
0, 5 - 3 connections
3, 9 - 4 connections
2, 7 - 5 connections
1, 8 - 6 connections
4 - 7 connections

Next, we relabel the vertices according to their sorted order:

Vertices: 
6 (0), 0 (1), 5 (2)
3 (3), 9 (4)
2 (5), 7 (6)
1 (7), 8 (8)
4 (9)

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: 
<0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 4>
<3, 4, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
