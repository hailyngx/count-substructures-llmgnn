Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, we list the nodes sorted by the number of their connections:
0 - 3 connections
1 - 2 connections
2 - 1 connection
4 - 1 connection
3 - 3 connections
7 - 3 connections
8 - 2 connections
6 - 4 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and check for triangles:
1. (0, 1):
   - Node 0 connections: 1, 3, 4
   - Node 1 connections: 0, 3
   - Shared connections: 3
   - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>

2. (0, 3):
   - Node 0 connections: 1, 3, 4
   - Node 3 connections: 0, 1, 7
   - Shared connections: 1
   - Triangle formed: <0, 3, 1>

3. (0, 4):
   - Node 0 connections: 1, 3, 4
   - Node 4 connections: 0
   - Shared connections: 0
   - No triangle formed.

4. (1, 3):
   - Node 1 connections: 0, 3
   - Node 3 connections: 0, 1, 7
   - Shared connections: 0

5. (2, 6):
   - Node 2 connections: 6
   - Node 6 connections: 2, 7, 8
   - Shared connections: None

6. (3, 7):
   - Node 3 connections: 0, 1, 7
   - Node 7 connections: 3, 6, 8
   - Shared connections: 3
   - Triangle formed: <3, 7, 6>

7. (6, 7):
   - Node 6 connections: 2, 7, 8
   - Node 7 connections: 3, 6, 8
   - Shared connections: 6, 8
   - Triangles formed: <6, 7, 8>

8. (6, 8):
   - Node 6 connections: 2, 7, 8
   - Node 8 connections: 6, 7
   - Shared connections: 6, 7
   - Triangle formed: <6, 8, 7>

9. (7, 8):
   - Node 7 connections: 3, 6, 8
   - Node 8 connections: 6, 7
   - Shared connections: 6, 7
   - Triangle formed: <7, 8, 6>

Total number of triangles: [5]
