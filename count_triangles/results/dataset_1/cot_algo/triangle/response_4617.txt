Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we can relabel the vertices as follows:
Vertices in order of least to most connections: 4, 9, 5, 1, 2, 6, 8, 0, 3, 7.

The edges to consider based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections are:
(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 7), (5, 8), (6, 1), (7, 2), (7, 9).

Now, counting the triangles formed by shared connections:
- Triangle <0, 6, 7> is formed by connections (0, 6), (0, 7), (6, 7).
- Triangle <0, 6, 8> is formed by connections (0, 6), (0, 8), (6, 8).
- Triangle <0, 7, 9> is formed by connections (0, 7), (7, 9), (0, 9).

Total number of triangles: [3]
