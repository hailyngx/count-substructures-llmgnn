Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 4, 9, 8, 5, 2, 1, 6, 3, 7, 0.

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For vertex 4 (degree 1): No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
- For vertex 9 (degree 2): No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
- For vertex 8 (degree 3): No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
- For vertex 5 (degree 3): No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
- For vertex 2 (degree 4): No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
- For vertex 1 (degree 4): No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
- For vertex 6 (degree 4): No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
- For vertex 3 (degree 5): Potential triangles: <2, 3, 5>; <3, 5, 6>; <3, 5, 7>; <3, 6, 7>.
- For vertex 7 (degree 5): Potential triangles: <0, 7, 9>; <0, 7, 2>; <0, 7, 3>; <7, 2, 3>; <7, 3, 9>.
- For vertex 0 (degree 6): Potential triangles: <0, 1, 8>; <0, 7, 9>; <0, 7, 2>; <0, 7, 3>; <0, 8, 6>; <0, 8, 1>; <0, 8, 6>; <0, 9, 7>.

Counting these triangles, we find a total of [18] triangles inside brackets. Unique triangles found are: <2, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 3>, <7, 2, 3>, <7, 3, 9>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 8, 6>.
