Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree of connectivity, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertex 0 has degree 3  
Vertex 1 has degree 2  
Vertex 2 has degree 2  
Vertex 7 has degree 2  
Vertex 6 has degree 2  
Vertex 8 has degree 4  
Vertex 5 has degree 6  
Vertex 9 has degree 4  
Vertex 3 has degree 5  
Vertex 4 has degree 5  

Now, we will consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

For each potential edge, we will check for shared connections to find triangles. 

Calculating the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

There are 8 triangles found:  
[8]  

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 5, 9>  
<2, 5, 8>  
<3, 4, 5>  
<3, 5, 8>  
<3, 5, 9>  
<3, 8, 9>  
<4, 5, 9>  
<5, 8, 9>
