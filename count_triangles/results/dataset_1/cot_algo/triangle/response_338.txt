Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will count the triangles:
1. Triangle: <0, 2, 8>
2. Triangle: <0, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
