Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the degree of each vertex in ascending order:

Vertices: 0 (1), 2 (1), 4 (1), 6 (2), 9 (3), 8 (4), 3 (5), 1 (5), 7 (5), 5 (7)

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly: 
0 --> 0 (degree 1)
2 --> 1 (degree 1)
4 --> 2 (degree 1)
6 --> 3 (degree 2)
9 --> 4 (degree 3)
8 --> 5 (degree 4)
3 --> 6 (degree 5)
1 --> 7 (degree 5)
7 --> 8 (degree 5)
5 --> 9 (degree 7)

Now, using the degree-based ordering method, we will count the triangles:

- For edge (0, 5): vertices 0 and 5 have 1 common connection (vertex 5), so we have one triangle <0, 5, 3>.
- For edge (1, 7): vertices 1 and 7 have 1 common connection (vertex 5), so we have one triangle <1, 7, 5>.
- For edge (1, 8): vertices 1 and 8 have 1 common connection (vertex 5), so we have one triangle <1, 8, 5>.
- For edge (1, 9): vertices 1 and 9 have 1 common connection (vertex 9), so we have one triangle <1, 9, 8>.
- For edge (2, 9): vertices 2 and 9 have no common connection.
- For edge (3, 5): vertices 3 and 5 have 1 common connection (vertex 6), so we have one triangle <3, 5, 6>.
- For edge (3, 6): vertices 3 and 6 have 1 common connection (vertex 5), so we have one triangle <3, 6, 5>.
- For edge (3, 7): vertices 3 and 7 have 1 common connection (vertex 5), so we have one triangle <3, 7, 5>.
- For edge (4, 5): vertices 4 and 5 have 1 common connection (vertex 5), so we have one triangle <4, 5, 8>.
- For edge (4, 8): vertices 4 and 8 have 1 common connection (vertex 5), so we have one triangle <4, 8, 5>.
- For edge (5, 0): already counted as <0, 5, 3>.
- For edge (5, 3): already counted as <3, 5, 6>.
- For edge (5, 4): already counted as <4, 5, 8>.
- For edge (5, 6): already counted as <3, 6, 5>.
- For edge (5, 7): already counted as <3, 7, 5>.
- For edge (5, 6): already counted as <3, 6, 5>.
- For edge (6, 3): already counted as <3, 6, 5>.
- For edge (6, 5): already counted as <3, 6, 5>.
- For edge (6, 8): vertices 6 and 8 have 1 common connection (vertex 5), so we have one triangle <6, 8, 5>.
- For edge (7, 1): already counted as <1, 7, 5>.
- For edge (7, 3): already counted as <3, 7, 5>.
- For edge (7, 5): already counted as <3, 7, 5>.
- For edge (8, 1): already counted as <1, 8, 5>.
- For edge (8, 4): already counted as <4, 8, 5>.
- For edge (8, 6): already counted as <6, 8, 5>.
- For edge (8, 9): vertices 8 and 9 have 1 common connection (vertex 5), so we have one triangle <8, 9, 5>.
- For edge (9, 1): already counted as <1, 9, 8>.
- For edge (9, 2): vertices 9 and 2 have no common connection.
- For edge (9, 8): already counted as <8, 9, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
