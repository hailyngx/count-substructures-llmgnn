Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 7, 1, 2, 5, 9, 8, 6, 3, 0, 4

Next, we'll relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 -> 0 (Degree: 4)
1 -> 1 (Degree: 2)
2 -> 2 (Degree: 2)
3 -> 3 (Degree: 3)
4 -> 4 (Degree: 6)
5 -> 5 (Degree: 2)
6 -> 6 (Degree: 3)
7 -> 7 (Degree: 0)
8 -> 8 (Degree: 2)
9 -> 9 (Degree: 2)

Now, we'll count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
(0, 4) and (0, 9) share connection 0, forming triangle <0, 4, 9>.
(0, 4) and (4, 1) share connection 4, forming triangle <0, 1, 4>.
(0, 4) and (4, 3) share connection 4, forming triangle <0, 3, 4>.
(1, 4) and (4, 3) share connection 4, forming triangle <1, 3, 4>.
(3, 4) and (4, 6) share connection 4, forming triangle <3, 4, 6>.
(3, 4) and (4, 5) share connection 4, forming triangle <3, 4, 5>.
(3, 5) and (5, 6) share connection 5, forming triangle <3, 5, 6>.
(3, 5) and (5, 4) share connection 5, forming triangle <3, 4, 5>.
(4, 5) and (5, 6) share connection 5, forming triangle <4, 5, 6>.
(4, 5) and (5, 3) share connection 5, forming triangle <4, 3, 5>.
(4, 6) and (6, 9) share connection 6, forming triangle <4, 6, 9>.
(4, 6) and (6, 5) share connection 6, forming triangle <4, 5, 6>.
(4, 6) and (6, 0) share connection 6, forming triangle <4, 0, 6>.
(5, 6) and (6, 4) share connection 6, forming triangle <5, 4, 6>.
(6, 4) and (4, 3) share connection 4, forming triangle <6, 3, 4>.
(6, 4) and (4, 0) share connection 4, forming triangle <6, 0, 4>.
(6, 5) and (5, 3) share connection 5, forming triangle <6, 3, 5>.
(8, 3) and (3, 4) share connection 3, forming triangle <8, 3, 4>.
(8, 3) and (3, 5) share connection 3, forming triangle <8, 3, 5>.
(9, 0) and (0, 4) share connection 0, forming triangle <9, 0, 4>.
(9, 0) and (0, 4) share connection 0, forming triangle <9, 0, 4>.
(9, 6) and (6, 4) share connection 6, forming triangle <9, 4, 6>.
(9, 6) and (6, 5) share connection 6, forming triangle <9, 5, 6>.


Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [23].
