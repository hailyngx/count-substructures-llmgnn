Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with the edges provided, we can calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

First, let's list the vertices and their corresponding degrees:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 1
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 8: degree 1
- Vertex 9: degree 2

Now, let's reorder the vertices by their degrees (ascending order):
Vertices in order: 4, 5, 8, 0, 2, 9, 3, 6, 7, 1

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Triangle <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle <1, 2, 7>

Finally, we list the total number of triangles found: [2].
