Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following relabeling:
Vertex 5: Connections [1]
Vertex 3: Connections [1]
Vertex 4: Connections [1]
Vertex 9: Connections [2]
Vertex 1: Connections [2]
Vertex 2: Connections [2]
Vertex 7: Connections [3]
Vertex 8: Connections [4]
Vertex 6: Connections [6]
Vertex 0: Connections [7]

Next, we will count the triangles based on the edges provided:

1. Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 0 = {6}, Shared connections with 2 = {} => Triangle formed with vertices {0, 2, 6}
2. Edge (0, 6): Shared connections with 0 = {7}, Shared connections with 6 = {1, 5} => Triangles formed with vertices {0, 6, 7} and {0, 6, 1}
3. Edge (0, 7): Shared connections with 0 = {6}, Shared connections with 7 = {1, 8} => Triangle formed with vertices {0, 7, 6}
4. Edge (0, 9): Shared connections with 0 = {}, Shared connections with 9 = {8} => No triangle formed
5. Edge (1, 6): Shared connections with 1 = {7}, Shared connections with 6 = {0} => Triangle formed with vertices {1, 6, 7}
6. Edge (1, 7): Shared connections with 1 = {}, Shared connections with 7 = {0, 8} => No triangle formed
7. Edge (2, 8): Shared connections with 2 = {}, Shared connections with 8 = {7} => No triangle formed
8. Edge (3, 6): Shared connections with 3 = {}, Shared connections with 6 = {0, 5} => No triangle formed
9. Edge (4, 8): Shared connections with 4 = {}, Shared connections with 8 = {2, 7, 9} => No triangle formed
10. Edge (5, 6): Shared connections with 5 = {}, Shared connections with 6 = {0} => No triangle formed

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 1>
<1, 6, 7>
