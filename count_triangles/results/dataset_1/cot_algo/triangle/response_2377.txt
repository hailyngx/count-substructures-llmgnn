Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, we relabel the nodes accordingly. 

The sorted nodes with their degrees are: 
(1, 1), (4, 1), (6, 0), (0, 4), (2, 3), (5, 2), (8, 2), (9, 3), (3, 4), (7, 3)

Now, we will go through the edges based on the lower-labeled vertex having fewer connections. 

Starting with the edges: 
(1, 3), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 8), (5, 0), (9, 0), (0, 2), (5, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3), (8, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 9), (3, 2), (3, 7), (8, 3), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Counting the triangles formed: 
There are [5] triangles in total.

Unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
