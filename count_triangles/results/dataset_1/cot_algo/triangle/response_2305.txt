Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:

0: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 1 connection
3: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 2 connections
9: 3 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

(0, 1): Shared connections with 3 and 3, forming triangle with vertex 3.
(0, 3): Shared connection with 3, forming triangle with vertex 3.
(0, 6): No triangle.
(1, 0): Shared connection with 3, forming triangle with vertex 3.
(1, 4): No triangle.
(1, 5): No triangle.
(2, 7): No triangle.
(3, 0): Shared connection with 3, forming triangle with vertex 3.
(3, 4): Shared connection with 1 and 4, forming triangle with vertices 1 and 4.
(3, 6): Shared connection with 0, forming triangle with vertex 0.
(3, 9): Shared connection with 7, forming triangle with vertex 7.
(4, 1): Shared connections with 3 and 5, forming triangle with vertex 3.
(4, 3): Shared connection with 1, forming triangle with vertex 1.
(4, 5): Shared connections with 1 and 5, forming triangle with vertex 1.
(4, 6): Shared connection with 0, forming triangle with vertex 0.
(5, 1): No triangle.
(5, 4): Shared connection with 1, forming triangle with vertex 1.
(6, 0): Shared connection with 3, forming triangle with vertex 3.
(6, 3): Shared connection with 0, forming triangle with vertex 0.
(6, 4): Shared connection with 0, forming triangle with vertex 0.
(7, 2): No triangle.
(7, 9): Shared connection with 3, forming triangle with vertex 3.
(9, 3): Shared connections with 6 and 7, forming triangle with vertices 6 and 7.
(9, 7): Shared connection with 3, forming triangle with vertex 3.

Count of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <6, 7, 9>
