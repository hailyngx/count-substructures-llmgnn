Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices is:
Nodes: 3, 7, 8, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 0

Using this ordering, we will count the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 5> (Shared connection: 0)
2. Triangle <0, 3, 4> (Shared connection: 3)
3. Triangle <2, 3, 6> (Shared connection: 3)
4. Triangle <0, 3, 9> (Shared connection: 3)
5. Triangle <6, 7, 8> (Shared connection: 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
