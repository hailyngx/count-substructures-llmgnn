Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we relabel the nodes as follows:
Node 2 has 0 connections.
Node 1 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 1 connection.

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 3): forms a triangle with shared connection 6. Triangle <0, 3, 6>.
- Edge (0, 4): forms a triangle with shared connection 6. Triangle <0, 4, 6>.
- Edge (0, 5): no triangle.
- Edge (0, 6): forms a triangle with shared connection 5. Triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- Edge (1, 4): forms a triangle with shared connection 6. Triangle <1, 4, 6>.
- Edge (1, 6): forms a triangle with shared connection 0. Triangle <1, 6, 0>.
- Edge (3, 0): already counted.
- Edge (3, 6): already counted.
- Edge (4, 0): already counted.
- Edge (4, 1): already counted.
- Edge (4, 7): forms a triangle with shared connection 6. Triangle <4, 7, 6>.
- Edge (5, 0): already counted.
- Edge (5, 6): already counted.
- Edge (6, 0): already counted.
- Edge (6, 1): already counted.
- Edge (6, 3): already counted.
- Edge (6, 5): already counted.
- Edge (6, 7): forms a triangle with shared connection 4. Triangle <6, 7, 4>.
- Edge (6, 8): no triangle.
- Edge (6, 9): no triangle.
- Edge (7, 4): already counted.
- Edge (7, 6): already counted.
- Edge (7, 8): no triangle.
- Edge (8, 6): no triangle.
- Edge (8, 7): no triangle.
- Edge (9, 6): no triangle.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Triangles found: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <4, 7, 6>.
