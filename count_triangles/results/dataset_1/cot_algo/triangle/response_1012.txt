Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most, and then relabeling the vertices accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices is as follows:
Vertex 3: 0 connections
Vertex 4: 0 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 7 connections
Vertex 7: 7 connections

Now, we will iterate through each edge and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1):
   - Vertex 0 and Vertex 1 share connections with Vertex 7, forming a triangle <0, 1, 7>.

2. Edge (0, 7):
   - No triangles formed as Vertex 0 has fewer connections than Vertex 7.

3. Edge (0, 9):
   - Vertex 0 and Vertex 9 share connections with Vertex 6, forming a triangle <0, 9, 6>.

4. Edge (1, 0):
   - No triangles formed as Vertex 0 has fewer connections than Vertex 1.

5. Edge (1, 2):
   - No triangles formed as Vertex 2 has more connections than Vertex 1.

6. Edge (1, 3):
   - No triangles formed as Vertex 1 has more connections than Vertex 3.

7. Edge (1, 4):
   - No triangles formed as Vertex 1 has more connections than Vertex 4.

8. Edge (1, 5):
   - No triangles formed as Vertex 1 has more connections than Vertex 5.

9. Edge (1, 7):
   - No triangles formed as Vertex 1 has more connections than Vertex 7.

10. Edge (2, 1):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 2 has fewer connections than Vertex 1.

11. Edge (2, 5):
    - Vertex 2 and Vertex 5 share connections with Vertex 1, forming a triangle <2, 5, 1>.

12. Edge (2, 6):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 2 has fewer connections than Vertex 6.

13. Edge (3, 1):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 1 has more connections than Vertex 3.

14. Edge (4, 1):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 1 has more connections than Vertex 4.

15. Edge (4, 7):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 4 has fewer connections than Vertex 7.

16. Edge (5, 1):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 1 has more connections than Vertex 5.

17. Edge (5, 2):
    - Vertex 5 and Vertex 2 share connections with Vertex 1, forming a triangle <5, 2, 1>.

18. Edge (5, 8):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 5 has fewer connections than Vertex 8.

19. Edge (6, 2):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 2 has more connections than Vertex 6.

20. Edge (6, 9):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 9 has fewer connections than Vertex 6.

21. Edge (7, 0):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 0 has more connections than Vertex 7.

22. Edge (7, 1):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 1 has more connections than Vertex 7.

23. Edge (7, 4):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 4 has fewer connections than Vertex 7.

24. Edge (8, 5):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 5 has more connections than Vertex 8.

25. Edge (9, 0):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 0 has more connections than Vertex 9.

26. Edge (9, 6):
    - No triangles formed as Vertex 6 has fewer connections than Vertex 9.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7> and <0, 9, 6>.
