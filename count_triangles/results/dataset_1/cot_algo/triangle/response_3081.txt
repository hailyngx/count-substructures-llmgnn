Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 2 - Degree 0
Node 9 - Degree 0
Node 5 - Degree 2
Node 8 - Degree 2
Node 1 - Degree 4
Node 0 - Degree 5
Node 7 - Degree 5
Node 4 - Degree 5
Node 3 - Degree 6
Node 6 - Degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 6): Forms triangles with nodes 3 and 4. Triangle: <0, 3, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 7): Forms triangles with nodes 1 and 3. Triangle: <0, 1, 3>.
3. Edge (1, 5): Does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 7): Forms a triangle with node 3. Triangle: <1, 0, 3>.
5. Edge (3, 4): Forms triangles with nodes 0 and 6. Triangle: <3, 0, 6>.
6. Edge (3, 6): Already counted in 5.
7. Edge (3, 7): Already counted in 2.
8. Edge (3, 9): Does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (4, 3): Already counted in 5.
10. Edge (4, 6): Already counted in 5.
11. Edge (4, 8): Forms a triangle with node 5. Triangle: <4, 5, 8>.
12. Edge (5, 1): Does not form a triangle.
13. Edge (5, 8): Forms a triangle with node 4. Triangle: <5, 4, 8>.
14. Edge (6, 0): Already counted in 1.
15. Edge (6, 3): Already counted in 5.
16. Edge (6, 4): Already counted in 5.
17. Edge (7, 0): Forms a triangle with node 1. Triangle: <7, 0, 1>.
18. Edge (7, 1): Already counted in 17.
19. Edge (7, 3): Already counted in 2.
20. Edge (8, 4): Already counted in 11.
21. Edge (8, 5): Already counted in 13.
22. Edge (9, 3): Does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
