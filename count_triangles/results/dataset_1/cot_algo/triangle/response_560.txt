Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on the number of connections:

0: 2 connections
1: 1 connection
2: 1 connection
3: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 1 connection
6: 5 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 3 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
0 -> 1
1 -> 3
2 -> 5
3 -> 2
4 -> 4
5 -> 6
6 -> 7
7 -> 8
8 -> 9
9 -> 10

Now we will count the triangles:
- Checking (0, 3): No triangle
- Checking (0, 9): No triangle
- Checking (1, 8): No triangle
- Checking (2, 6): No triangle
- Checking (3, 8): Triangle found: <2, 7, 9>
- Checking (4, 6): Triangle found: <4, 7, 9>
- Checking (4, 7): Triangle found: <4, 7, 9>
- Checking (5, 6): No triangle
- Checking (6, 2): No triangle
- Checking (6, 4): No triangle
- Checking (6, 5): No triangle
- Checking (6, 7): Triangle found: <6, 7, 9>
- Checking (6, 9): Triangle found: <6, 7, 9>
- Checking (7, 4): No triangle
- Checking (7, 6): Triangle found: <7, 4, 9>
- Checking (8, 1): No triangle
- Checking (8, 3): Triangle found: <8, 2, 9>
- Checking (8, 9): Triangle found: <8, 9, 7>
- Checking (9, 0): No triangle
- Checking (9, 6): No triangle
- Checking (9, 8): Triangle found: <9, 7, 8>

Count of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles found: <2, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 4, 9>, <8, 2, 9>, <8, 9, 7>, <9, 7, 8>
