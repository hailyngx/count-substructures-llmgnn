Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:

1. Sort vertices based on their degrees:
   Node 8: Degree 1
   Node 0, 7: Degree 2
   Node 3, 9: Degree 3
   Node 2, 4, 6: Degree 4
   Node 1, 5: Degree 5

2. Relabel the vertices:
   Node 8: 0
   Node 0, 7: 1
   Node 3, 9: 2
   Node 2, 4, 6: 3
   Node 1, 5: 4

3. Check each edge:
   (0, 1) forms a triangle with 3
   (0, 3) forms a triangle with 6
   (1, 0) cannot form a triangle
   (1, 2) forms a triangle with 3
   (1, 3) forms a triangle with 6
   (1, 4) forms a triangle with 5
   (1, 5) forms a triangle with 2 and 3
   (2, 1) cannot form a triangle
   (2, 5) forms a triangle with 4
   (2, 6) forms a triangle with 3, 5, and 9
   (2, 7) cannot form a triangle
   (3, 0) cannot form a triangle
   (3, 1) cannot form a triangle
   (3, 4) forms a triangle with 6
   (3, 6) forms a triangle with 5
   (4, 1) cannot form a triangle
   (4, 3) cannot form a triangle
   (4, 5) forms a triangle with 1
   (4, 9) cannot form a triangle
   (5, 1) cannot form a triangle
   (5, 2) cannot form a triangle
   (5, 4) cannot form a triangle
   (5, 6) forms a triangle with 1 and 3
   (5, 8) cannot form a triangle
   (5, 9) forms a triangle with 2 and 6
   (6, 2) cannot form a triangle
   (6, 3) cannot form a triangle
   (6, 5) cannot form a triangle
   (6, 7) cannot form a triangle
   (6, 9) cannot form a triangle
   (7, 2) cannot form a triangle
   (7, 6) cannot form a triangle
   (8, 5) cannot form a triangle
   (9, 4) cannot form a triangle
   (9, 5) cannot form a triangle
   (9, 6) cannot form a triangle

Counting the triangles, we find 8 triangles in total:

[8]
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 9>
