Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of all nodes and their corresponding degrees:
Node 0 -> degree 3
Node 1 -> degree 1
Node 2 -> degree 5
Node 3 -> degree 2
Node 5 -> degree 4
Node 6 -> degree 3
Node 7 -> degree 2
Node 8 -> degree 3

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:
Node 1 -> degree 1
Node 3 -> degree 2
Node 7 -> degree 2
Node 0 -> degree 3
Node 6 -> degree 3
Node 8 -> degree 3
Node 5 -> degree 4
Node 2 -> degree 5

Now, we analyze each edge based on the ordering of nodes:
Edge (1, 0): Node 1 has degree 1, so we proceed.
Edge (3, 2): Node 3 has degree 2, so we proceed.
Edge (7, 5): Node 7 has degree 2, so we proceed.
Edge (0, 1): Node 0 has degree 3, we check for shared connections between neighbors of Node 1 and Node 0:
Shared connection: 2
Triangle found: <0, 1, 2>
Edge (6, 7): Node 6 has degree 3, so we proceed.
Edge (2, 3): Node 2 has degree 5, we check for shared connections between neighbors of Node 3 and Node 2:
Shared connections: 6
Triangle found: <2, 3, 6>
Triangle found: <2, 3, 7>
Edge (8, 5): Node 8 has degree 3, we check for shared connections between neighbors of Node 5 and Node 8:
Shared connections: 2, 6
Triangle found: <2, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 8>
