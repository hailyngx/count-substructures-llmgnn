Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 2: degree 0
Node 5: degree 0
Node 7: degree 0

Node 1: degree 1
Node 8: degree 1
Node 9: degree 1

Node 3: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2

Node 0: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 2 (0 connections) becomes Node 0
Node 5 (0 connections) becomes Node 1
Node 7 (0 connections) becomes Node 2

Node 1 (1 connection) becomes Node 3
Node 8 (1 connection) becomes Node 4
Node 9 (1 connection) becomes Node 5

Node 3 (2 connections) becomes Node 6
Node 5 (2 connections) becomes Node 7

Node 0 (3 connections) becomes Node 8
Node 4 (3 connections) becomes Node 9
Node 6 (3 connections) becomes Node 10

Now, let's look at the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Edge (0, 4): Both nodes have 3 connections (Degree)
Edge (0, 6): Both nodes have 3 connections (Degree)
Edge (0, 9): Node 0 (3 connections) < Node 5 (1 connection)
Edge (1, 6): Node 3 (1 connection) < Node 10 (3 connections)
Edge (3, 4): Both nodes have 2 connections (Degree)
Edge (3, 8): Node 6 (2 connections) < Node 4 (1 connection)

Now, we check for shared connections:

For edge (0, 9):
Node 0 shares a connection with Node 4 and Node 6 (forming triangles <0, 4, 9> and <0, 6, 9>).

For edge (1, 6):
Node 3 shares a connection with Node 4 (forming triangle <1, 3, 6>).

For edge (3, 8):
Node 6 shares a connection with Node 4 (forming triangle <3, 6, 8>).

After examining all edges and shared connections, we found 3 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
