Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 2: 2 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
