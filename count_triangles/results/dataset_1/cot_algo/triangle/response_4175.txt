Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's order the vertices based on their degree:
    Node 0: 1 connection
    Node 1: 2 connections
    Node 9: 2 connections
    Node 2: 2 connections
    Node 4: 3 connections
    Node 8: 1 connection
    Node 3: 4 connections
    Node 7: 4 connections
    Node 5: 5 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start with the edges involving the vertices with lower labels and fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 2): Forms the triangle <0, 2, 3>.
2. Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (2, 3): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (3, 4): Forms the triangle <3, 4, 5>.
6. Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (3, 7): Forms the triangle <3, 7, 5>.
8. Edge (4, 7): Forms the triangle <4, 7, 5>.
9. Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
