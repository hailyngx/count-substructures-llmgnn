Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices in the order of their degrees from least to most:
Vertices: 8, 1, 4, 6, 5, 9, 3, 7, 0, 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 8 -> 0
Vertex 1 -> 1
Vertex 4 -> 2
Vertex 6 -> 3
Vertex 5 -> 4
Vertex 9 -> 5
Vertex 3 -> 6
Vertex 7 -> 7
Vertex 0 -> 8
Vertex 2 -> 9

Next, we will examine the edges based on the vertex labels and count the triangles:
Triangles: 6
[6]

Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 7>
