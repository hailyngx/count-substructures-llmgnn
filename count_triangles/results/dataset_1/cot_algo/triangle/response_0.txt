Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order and relabeling them accordingly, we have the following degrees for each vertex:
```
0: 1 connection
1: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
8: 1 connection
9: 1 connection
4: 5 connections
7: 4 connections
```
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles in the graph:
- Edge (0, 3): No triangle forms.
- Edge (1, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 6> is formed.
- Edge (1, 7): Triangle <1, 4, 7> is formed.
- Edge (3, 4): Triangle <3, 4, 6> is formed.
- Edge (4, 6): No triangle forms.
- Edge (4, 7): Triangle <4, 6, 7> is formed.
- Edge (7, 8): No triangle forms.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, and <3, 4, 6>.
