Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows: 
Node 0 has 2 connections. 
Node 5 has 1 connection. 
Node 2 has 1 connection. 
Node 4 has 3 connections. 
Node 7 has 2 connections. 
Node 6 has 3 connections. 
Node 1 has 4 connections. 
Node 8 has 4 connections. 
Node 9 has 4 connections. 
Node 3 has 4 connections. 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we identify the triangles based on the shared connections between the vertices with lower labels in each edge. 

The total number of triangles is [2]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 8>.
