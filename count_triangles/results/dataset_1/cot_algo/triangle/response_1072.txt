Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their number of connections, the graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 has 3 connections.
- Node 5 has 2 connections.
- Nodes 6 and 10 have 0 connections.
- Nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 all have 5 connections.
- Nodes 2 has 4 connections.

Now, by following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

After counting, the total number of triangles is found to be [6].

The unique triangles found are:
- <0, 1, 7>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>
