Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 0: degree 5
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 5
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 2

Now, we sort the vertices by their degree:
Vertices by degree: 4, 5, 7, 9, 6, 8, 3, 1, 0, 2

Next, we relabel the vertices:
- Vertex 4 (degree 2): relabeled as 0
- Vertex 5 (degree 2): relabeled as 1
- Vertex 7 (degree 2): relabeled as 2
- Vertex 9 (degree 2): relabeled as 3
- Vertex 6 (degree 3): relabeled as 4
- Vertex 8 (degree 3): relabeled as 5
- Vertex 3 (degree 3): relabeled as 6
- Vertex 1 (degree 4): relabeled as 7
- Vertex 0 (degree 5): relabeled as 8
- Vertex 2 (degree 5): relabeled as 9

Now, we check the edges using the relabeled vertices:
- Edge (0, 1): Check for shared connections with vertices 0 and 1: Triangle with vertex 2
- Edge (0, 2): Check for shared connections with vertices 0 and 2: Triangle with vertices 6 and 7
- Edge (0, 3): No action (vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 3)
- Edge (0, 6): No action (vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 6)
- Edge (0, 7): No action (vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 7)
- Edge (1, 2): Check for shared connections with vertices 1 and 2: Triangle with vertices 4 and 5
- Edge (1, 4): No action (vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 4)
- Edge (1, 8): No action (vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 8)
- Edge (2, 3): No action (vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 3)
- Edge (2, 5): No action (vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 5)
- Edge (2, 6): No action (vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 6)
- Edge (2, 8): No action (vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 8)
- Edge (3, 9): No action (vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 9)
- Edge (4, 5): No action (vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 5)
- Edge (6, 7): No action (vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 7)
- Edge (8, 9): No action (vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 9)

The triangles found are:
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 2, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
