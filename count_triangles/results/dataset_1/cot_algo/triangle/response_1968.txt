Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the relabeled graph becomes:
- Node 0 is now node 4
- Node 1 is now node 5
- Node 5 is now node 2
- Node 6 is now node 3
- Node 3 is now node 7
- Node 7 is now node 1
- Node 8 is now node 6
- Node 2 is now node 8
- Node 9 is now node 9 
- Node 4 is now node 0

Now, let's list the triangles based on the shared connections between the vertices:
- <1, 2, 7>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
