Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to list the vertices sorted by degree:
Vertices: 0(5), 1(4), 5(3), 8(2), 9(2), 3(2), 6(2), 4(1), 2(1), 7(0)

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on the sorted list:
Vertices: 7(0), 4(1), 2(1), 8(2), 9(2), 3(2), 6(2), 0(5), 5(3), 1(4)

Next, we will list the edges following the degree-based ordering rule:
(2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 1) (9, 5) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (5, 9) (5, 1)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by checking shared connections for each edge:
Triangles: <0, 5, 9> <0, 1, 5> <0, 1, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
