Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of vertices is as follows:
- Vertex 2 has 1 connection.
- Vertices 4, 8, and 2 have 2 connections each.
- Vertices 3, 6, and 7 have 3 connections each.
- Vertices 1 and 5 have the most connections with 4 each.
  
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. The triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
