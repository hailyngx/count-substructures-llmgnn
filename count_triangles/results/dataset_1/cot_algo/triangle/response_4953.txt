Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows the steps outlined below to count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabel them:
   - Vertex 5: 1 connection
   - Vertex 6: 2 connections
   - Vertex 8: 2 connections
   - Vertex 9: 2 connections
   - Vertex 0: 3 connections
   - Vertex 4: 3 connections
   - Vertex 2: 4 connections
   - Vertex 1: 6 connections
   - Vertex 7: 6 connections
   - Vertex 3: 7 connections

2. For each edge, we will proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This ensures that each triangle is only counted once.

Now, we will check for shared connections to find the triangles:

- Triangle <1, 3, 9> (via edges 1-3, 1-9, and 3-9)
- Triangle <1, 4, 9> (via edges 1-4, 1-9, and 4-9)
- Triangle <3, 4, 7> (via edges 3-4, 3-7, and 4-7)

Therefore, after identifying the unique triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
