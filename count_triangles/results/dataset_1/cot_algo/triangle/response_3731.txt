Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

- Vertex 3: degree 1
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 0
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 0
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 5
- Vertex 2: degree 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
- Vertex 3: 0
- Vertex 1: 1
- Vertex 7: 2
- Vertex 6: 3
- Vertex 0: 4
- Vertex 6: 5
- Vertex 8: 6
- Vertex 9: 7
- Vertex 5: 8
- Vertex 2: 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle 4: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle 5: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 6: <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle 7: <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle 8: <2, 8, 9>
- Triangle 9: <4, 5, 9>
- Triangle 10: <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
