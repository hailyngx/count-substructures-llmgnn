Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us count the number of triangles in this graph.

First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 5
- Node 1: degree = 6
- Node 2: degree = 5
- Node 3: degree = 5
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 4
- Node 6: degree = 2
- Node 7: degree = 3
- Node 8: degree = 3
- Node 9: degree = 4

Now we'll sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 6: degree = 2
- Node 7: degree = 3
- Node 8: degree = 3
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 4
- Node 9: degree = 4
- Node 0: degree = 5
- Node 2: degree = 5
- Node 3: degree = 5
- Node 1: degree = 6

Next, we'll relabel the nodes based on this new order:
- Node 0: new label = 0
- Node 2: new label = 1
- Node 1: new label = 2
- Node 8: new label = 3
- Node 7: new label = 4
- Node 9: new label = 5
- Node 5: new label = 6
- Node 4: new label = 7
- Node 3: new label = 8
- Node 6: new label = 9

Now, we'll go through each edge in the graph and count the number of triangles:
1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 and Node 2 share connections with Node 1. Triangle <0, 1, 2> found.
2. Edge (0, 3): Node 0 and Node 8 share connections with Node 3. No new triangles found.
3. Edge (0, 5): Node 0 and Node 6 share connections with Node 5. No new triangles found.
4. Edge (0, 8): Node 0 and Node 3 share connections with Node 8. No new triangles found.
5. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 and Node 5 share connections with Node 9. No new triangles found.
6. Edge (1, 2): Node 2 and Node 8 share connections with Node 1. No new triangles found.
7. Edge (1, 3): Node 2 and Node 3 share connections with Node 1. Triangle <1, 3, 2> found.
8. Edge (1, 4): Node 2 and Node 7 share connections with Node 4. No new triangles found.
9. Edge (1, 5): Node 2 and Node 6 share connections with Node 5. No new triangles found.
10. Edge (1, 8): Node 2 and Node 3 share connections with Node 8. No new triangles found.
11. Edge (1, 9): Node 2 and Node 5 share connections with Node 9. No new triangles found.
12. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 and Node 7 share connections with Node 4. No new triangles found.
13. Edge (3, 5): Node 3 and Node 6 share connections with Node 5. No new triangles found.
14. Edge (4, 7): Node 7 and Node 6 share connections with Node 4. No new triangles found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2> and <1, 3, 2>.
