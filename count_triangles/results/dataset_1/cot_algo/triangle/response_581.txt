Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees and then relabeling them accordingly. Let's apply this method to the given graph:

Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 6 connections.

Now, we will relabel the nodes:
Node 1 -> A
Node 4 -> B
Node 0 -> C
Node 9 -> D
Node 5 -> E
Node 6 -> F
Node 8 -> G
Node 7 -> H
Node 2 -> I
Node 3 -> J

Next, we will list the edges keeping in mind that we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. These edges are:
(B, E)
(D, J)
(A, I)
(E, H)
(F, E)
(G, C)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by these edges:
- Triangle <B, E, H>
- Triangle <E, F, H>
- Triangle <E, G, H>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
