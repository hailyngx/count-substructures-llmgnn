Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices in ascending order of connections: 4, 6, 1, 8, 3, 5, 9, 7, 0, 2

Now, we will count the triangles based on the given edges:
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 9, 1>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 7, 0>
<2, 9, 0>
<4, 3, 7>
<4, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
