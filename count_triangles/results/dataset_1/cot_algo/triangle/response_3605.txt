Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 5 connections
- Vertex 8: 5 connections
- Vertex 3: 6 connections
- Vertex 4: 9 connections

Now, let's count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Triangle <1, 4, 0>
- Triangle <1, 4, 2>
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle <1, 4, 3>
- Triangle <6, 4, 1>
- Triangle <6, 4, 7>
- Triangle <6, 4, 3>
- Triangle <8, 4, 1>
- Triangle <8, 4, 7>
- Triangle <8, 4, 3>

Total number of triangles: [10]
