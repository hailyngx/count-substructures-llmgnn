Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
- Node 5: Degree 1
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 6: Degree 2
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 5
- Node 9: Degree 5
- Node 2: Degree 6
- Node 0: Degree 6

Now, we will relabel the nodes:
- Node 5 (Degree 1) -> Node 0
- Node 1 (Degree 2) -> Node 1
- Node 6 (Degree 2) -> Node 2
- Node 7 (Degree 2) -> Node 3
- Node 8 (Degree 3) -> Node 4
- Node 3 (Degree 4) -> Node 5
- Node 4 (Degree 5) -> Node 6
- Node 9 (Degree 5) -> Node 7
- Node 2 (Degree 6) -> Node 8
- Node 0 (Degree 6) -> Node 9

Now, let's find the triangles based on the connections:

- Triangle 1: <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle 2: <1, 4, 0>
- Triangle 3: <1, 4, 3>
- Triangle 4: <1, 4, 2>
- Triangle 5: <1, 6, 2>
- Triangle 6: <1, 6, 0>
- Triangle 7: <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle 8: <4, 0, 9>
- Triangle 9: <4, 0, 2>
- Triangle 10: <4, 3, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10].
