Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows:
Vertices: 0, 8, 4, 6, 5, 2, 7, 1, 3, 9.

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge:
- Edge (0, 3): Both vertices have degree 4, so proceed.
    - They share 1 common neighbor: vertex 1.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>.
- Edge (0, 4): Both vertices have degree 4, so proceed.
    - They share 1 common neighbor: vertex 5.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 4>.
- Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has degree 5, while vertex 2 has degree 3, so proceed.
    - They share 2 common neighbors: vertices 3 and 9.
    - Triangles formed: <1, 3, 2> and <1, 9, 2>.
- Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 has degree 5, while vertex 3 has degree 4, so proceed.
    - They share 2 common neighbors: vertices 0 and 2.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>.
- Edge (1, 6): Both vertices have degree 3, so proceed.
    - They share 1 common neighbor: vertex 8.
    - Triangle formed: <1, 8, 6>.
- Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has degree 5, while vertex 7 has degree 4, so proceed.
    - They share 2 common neighbors: vertices 4 and 5.
    - Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>.
- Edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 has degree 3, while vertex 3 has degree 4, so proceed.
    - They share 2 common neighbors: vertices 1 and 9.
    - Triangle formed: <1, 3, 2>.
- Edge (3, 5): Both vertices have degree 4, so proceed.
    - They share 2 common neighbors: vertices 0 and 4.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>.
- Edge (4, 5): Vertex 4 has degree 4, while vertex 5 has degree 4, so proceed.
    - They share 2 common neighbors: vertices 0 and 3.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>.
- Edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 has degree 4, while vertex 7 has degree 4, so proceed.
    - They share 2 common neighbors: vertices 1 and 5.
    - Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>.
- Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has degree 4, while vertex 7 has degree 4, so proceed.
    - They share 2 common neighbors: vertices 1 and 4.
    - Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>.
- Edge (6, 8): Both vertices have degree 3, so proceed.
    - They share 1 common neighbor: vertex 9.
    - Triangle formed: <6, 9, 8>.
- Edge (6, 9): Both vertices have degree 3, so proceed.
    - They share 1 common neighbor: vertex 2.
    - Triangle formed: <6, 2, 9>.
- Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has degree 4, while vertex 9 has degree 4, so proceed.
    - They share 2 common neighbors: vertices 2 and 4.
    - Triangle formed: <1, 7, 9>.

Total number of unique triangles in the graph: [9].
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 1>.
