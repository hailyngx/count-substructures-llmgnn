Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the nodes based on their degrees, the new labeling of nodes is as follows:
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

1. For edge (0, 4): Node 0 has 2 connections and Node 4 has 4 connections. Since Node 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    Shared connections: None

2. For edge (1, 3): Node 1 has 2 connections and Node 3 has 6 connections. Since Node 1 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    Shared connections: None

3. For edge (1, 8): Node 1 has 2 connections and Node 8 has 4 connections. Since Node 1 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    Shared connections: None

4. For edge (2, 7): Node 2 has 3 connections and Node 7 has 5 connections. Since Node 2 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    Shared connections: None

5. For edge (2, 8): Node 2 has 3 connections and Node 8 has 4 connections. Since Node 2 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    Shared connections: None

6. For edge (3, 1): Not processed because Node 1 has more connections than Node 3.

7. For edge (3, 4): Not processed because Node 4 has more connections than Node 3.

8. For edge (3, 7): Node 3 has 6 connections and Node 7 has 5 connections. Since Node 7 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    Shared connections: None

9. For edge (3, 9): Node 3 has 6 connections and Node 9 has 3 connections. Since Node 9 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    Shared connections: None

10. For edge (4, 0): Not processed because Node 0 has more connections than Node 4.

11. For edge (4, 3): Not processed because Node 4 has more connections than Node 3.

12. For edge (4, 7): Not processed because Node 7 has more connections than Node 4.

13. For edge (5, 8): Node 5 has 2 connections and Node 8 has 4 connections. Since Node 5 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    Shared connections: None

14. For edge (5, 9): Node 5 has 2 connections and Node 9 has 3 connections. Since Node 5 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    Shared connections: None

15. For edge (6, 7): Node 6 has 2 connections and Node 7 has 5 connections. Since Node 6 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    Shared connections: None

16. For edge (6, 8): Node 6 has 2 connections and Node 8 has 4 connections. Since Node 6 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    Shared connections: None

17. For edge (7, 2): Not processed because Node 2 has more connections than Node 7.

18. For edge (7, 3): Not processed because Node 3 has more connections than Node 7.

19. For edge (7, 4): Not processed because Node 4 has more connections than Node 7.

20. For edge (7, 6): Not processed because Node 6 has more connections than Node 7.

21. For edge (8, 1): Not processed because Node 1 has more connections than Node 8.

22. For edge (8, 2): Not processed because Node 2 has more connections than Node 8.

23. For edge (8, 5): Not processed because Node 5 has more connections than Node 8.

24. For edge (8, 6): Not processed because Node 6 has more connections than Node 8.

25. For edge (8, 9): Node 8 has 4 connections and Node 9 has 3 connections. Since Node 9 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    Shared connections: None

26. For edge (9, 3): Not processed because Node 3 has more connections than Node 9.

27. For edge (9, 5): Not processed because Node 5 has more connections than Node 9.

28. For edge (9, 8): Not processed because Node 8 has more connections than Node 9.
