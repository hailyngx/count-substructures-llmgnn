Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
Node 4 (degree 1)  
Node 6 (degree 1)  
Node 0 (degree 2)  
Node 2 (degree 2)  
Node 7 (degree 3)  
Node 4 (degree 3)  
Node 3 (degree 4)  
Node 1 (degree 4)  
Node 8 (degree 4)  
Node 9 (degree 5)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0 - 3 - 9  
2. Edge (0, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0 - 5 - 1  
3. Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed  
4. Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1 - 5 - 7  
5. Edge (1, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1 - 7 - 9  
6. Edge (1, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1 - 9 - 3  
7. Edge (2, 1): No triangle formed  
8. Edge (3, 0): Already counted  
9. Edge (3, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3 - 8 - 5  
10. Edge (3, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3 - 9 - 1  
11. Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed  
12. Edge (5, 0): Already counted  
13. Edge (5, 1): Already counted  
14. Edge (5, 7): Already counted  
15. Edge (5, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection 5 - 8 - 3  
16. Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed  
17. Edge (7, 1): Already counted  
18. Edge (7, 5): Already counted  
19. Edge (7, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 7 - 9 - 1  
20. Edge (8, 3): Already counted  
21. Edge (8, 4): No triangle formed  
22. Edge (8, 5): Already counted  
23. Edge (9, 1): Already counted  
24. Edge (9, 3): Already counted  
25. Edge (9, 6): No triangle formed  
26. Edge (9, 7): Already counted  

Total number of triangles: [6]  
Unique triangles:
