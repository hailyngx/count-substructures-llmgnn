Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 3

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degrees in ascending order:
Vertices in order: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's proceed based on the degree-based ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 6): Both vertices have degree 2.
2. Edge (1, 7): Both vertices have degree 2.
3. Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has smaller degree.
   - Shared connections between 1 and 8: 7
4. Edge (3, 7): Both vertices have degree 2.
5. Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 has smaller degree.
   - Shared connections between 3 and 9: None
6. Edge (4, 6): Both vertices have degree 2.
7. Edge (5, 8): Both vertices have degree 2.
8. Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 has smaller degree.
   - Shared connections between 5 and 9: None
9. Edge (6, 0): Both vertices have degree 2.
10. Edge (6, 4): Both vertices have degree 2.
11. Edge (7, 1): Vertex 1 has smaller degree.
    - Shared connections between 7 and 1: None
12. Edge (7, 3): Both vertices have degree 2.
13. Edge (8, 1): Vertex 1 has smaller degree.
    - Shared connections between 8 and 1: None
14. Edge (8, 5): Vertex 5 has smaller degree.
    - Shared connections between 8 and 5: None
15. Edge (8, 9): Vertex 8 has smaller degree.
    - Shared connections between 8 and 9: 1
16. Edge (9, 3): Vertex 3 has smaller degree.
    - Shared connections between 9 and 3: None
17. Edge (9, 5): Vertex 5 has smaller degree.
    - Shared connections between 9 and 5: None
18. Edge (9, 8): Vertex 8 has smaller degree.
    - Shared connections between 9 and 8: 1
