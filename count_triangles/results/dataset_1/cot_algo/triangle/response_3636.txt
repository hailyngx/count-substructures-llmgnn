Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Node 0 has 2 connections
- Node 1 has 3 connections
- Node 2 has 3 connections
- Node 4 has 3 connections
- Node 5 has 3 connections
- Node 6 has 3 connections
- Node 7 has 3 connections
- Node 9 has 3 connections
- Node 8 has 5 connections
- Node 3 has 7 connections

Based on the sorted vertices, we can see that the following triangles exist:
- <3, 1, 8>
- <3, 1, 6>
- <3, 1, 4>
- <3, 2, 4>
- <5, 3, 8>
- <5, 3, 9>
- <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
