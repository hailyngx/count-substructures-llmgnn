Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using Degree Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degrees. The degrees of each vertex are as follows:
- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 1 has degree 3
- Vertex 2 has degree 2
- Vertex 3 has degree 6
- Vertex 4 has degree 3
- Vertex 5 has degree 3
- Vertex 6 has degree 4
- Vertex 7 has degree 3
- Vertex 8 has degree 5
- Vertex 9 has degree 3

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees from lowest to highest:
- Vertex 0 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 2 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 4 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 1 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 5 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 7 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 9 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 6 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 8 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 3 (degree 6) becomes Vertex 9

Now, we will identify the triangles by traversing through the edges based on the new labeling:
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle <1, 3, 9>
- Triangle <3, 4, 6>
- Triangle <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle <3, 6, 8>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle <5, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
