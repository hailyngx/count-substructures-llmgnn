Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices in ascending order of their degrees: 5, 4, 7, 9, 3, 2, 6, 8, 1, 0

Now, we'll relabel the vertices accordingly:
Node 5 (Degree 0) -> Node 0
Node 4 (Degree 0) -> Node 1
Node 7 (Degree 0) -> Node 2
Node 9 (Degree 2) -> Node 3
Node 3 (Degree 2) -> Node 4
Node 2 (Degree 2) -> Node 5
Node 6 (Degree 3) -> Node 6
Node 8 (Degree 4) -> Node 7
Node 1 (Degree 4) -> Node 8
Node 0 (Degree 7) -> Node 9

Now, let's list the edges based on the new labels:
(9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (4, 8)

Now, we'll count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles:
<8, 3, 7>
<8, 4, 1>
<7, 2, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 8, 7>

Total number of triangles: [5]
