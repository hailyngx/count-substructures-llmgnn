Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
1. Vertex 1: 1 connection
2. Vertex 6: 1 connection
3. Vertex 3: 2 connections
4. Vertex 4: 2 connections
5. Vertex 5: 4 connections
6. Vertex 2: 4 connections
7. Vertex 0: 5 connections
8. Vertex 8: 3 connections
9. Vertex 9: 3 connections
10. Vertex 7: 6 connections

Now, we will list the edges in the order described above:

1. (1, 6)
2. (2, 4)
3. (3, 5)
4. (4, 2)
5. (5, 3)
6. (0, 7)
7. (8, 9)
8. (9, 8)
9. (7, 3)
10. (6, 1)
11. (5, 2)
12. (3, 7)
13. (8, 0)
14. (9, 7)
15. (0, 8)
16. (7, 6)
17. (7, 0)
18. (2, 5)
19. (4, 5)
20. (5, 4)
21. (7, 9)
22. (9, 0)
23. (7, 8)
24. (8, 7)
25. (0, 9)

Counting the number of triangles formed:

1. <0, 7, 9>
2. <0, 7, 8>
3. <0, 7, 3>
4. <2, 4, 5>
5. <0, 8, 9>
6. <3, 5, 7>
7. <2, 4, 5>
8. <7, 8, 9> 
9. <2, 4, 5>

Total number of triangles: [9]
