Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following labels for the nodes:
Node 0 has 0 connections
Node 1 has 1 connections
Node 4 has 1 connections
Node 5 has 1 connections
Node 9 has 1 connections
Node 3 has 2 connections
Node 8 has 2 connections
Node 7 has 3 connections
Node 2 has 3 connections
Node 6 has 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will look at the edges in the order given, checking only when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 have 0 shared connections.
2. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 and Node 6 have 0 shared connections.
3. Edge (2, 8): Node 2 and Node 8 have 0 shared connections.
4. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 and Node 6 have 2 shared connections, forming a triangle with Node 7.
5. Edge (3, 7): Node 3 and Node 7 have 2 shared connections, forming a triangle with Node 6.
6. Edge (4, 6): Node 4 and Node 6 have 1 shared connection.
7. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 and Node 6 have 1 shared connection.
8. Edge (6, 1): Node 1 and Node 6 have 0 shared connections.
9. Edge (6, 3): Node 3 and Node 6 have 2 shared connections, forming a triangle with Node 7.
10. Edge (6, 4): Node 4 and Node 6 have 1 shared connection.
11. Edge (6, 5): Node 5 and Node 6 have 1 shared connection.
12. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 and Node 7 have 2 shared connections, forming a triangle with Node 3.
13. Edge (7, 3): Node 3 and Node 7 have 2 shared connections, forming a triangle with Node 6.
14. Edge (8, 2): Node 2 and Node 8 have 0 shared connections.
15. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 and Node 9 have 0 shared connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 4>, and <3, 7, 6>.
