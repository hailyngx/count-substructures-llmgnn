Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
Nodes: 7, 5, 6, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 9, 8

Using the degree-based ordering method, we find the following triangles: 
[8]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 8>
