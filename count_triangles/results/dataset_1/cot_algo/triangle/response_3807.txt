Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has, and then relabeling the vertices accordingly.

The degrees of each vertex are as follows:
Vertex 0: Degree 3
Vertex 1: Degree 1
Vertex 2: Degree 6
Vertex 3: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 1
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 8: Degree 6
Vertex 9: Degree 4

After relabeling based on degrees:
Vertex 1 (Degree 1) → Vertex A
Vertex 5 (Degree 1) → Vertex B
Vertex 0 (Degree 3) → Vertex C
Vertex 7 (Degree 3) → Vertex D
Vertex 4 (Degree 4) → Vertex E
Vertex 6 (Degree 4) → Vertex F
Vertex 9 (Degree 4) → Vertex G
Vertex 3 (Degree 5) → Vertex H
Vertex 2 (Degree 6) → Vertex I
Vertex 8 (Degree 6) → Vertex J

Now, we will count the triangles based on the connections between vertices with lower labels.

Calculating the triangles:
- <A, D, I>
- <B, C, I>
- <B, F, G>
- <C, E, I>
- <C, G, J>
- <D, F, J>
- <D, H, I>
- <D, I, J>
- <E, G, J>
- <F, G, J>

Total number of triangles: [10]
