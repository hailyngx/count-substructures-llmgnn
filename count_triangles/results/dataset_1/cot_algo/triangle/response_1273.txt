Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new ordering is: <5, 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2>.

Now, we will iterate through the edges to count the triangles formed:

For edge (0, 1):
- Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 2, 3, and 8.
- Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 3 and 9. Shared connection: 3.
- Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>.

For edge (0, 2):
- Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 3, 8.
- Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 3 and 4. Shared connection: 3.
- Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.

For edge (0, 3):
- Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 2, 8.
- Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 1, 2, 4, 6, 7. Shared connections: 1, 2.
- Triangles formed: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 3>.

For edge (0, 8):
- Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 2, 3.
- Vertex 8 has connections with vertices 2, 4. Shared connection: 2.
- Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>.

For edge (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8):
- No new triangles formed.

For edge (2, 9):
- Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 3, 4, 8.
- Vertex 9 has connections with vertices 1, 6. No shared connection.

For edge (3, 4):
- Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 0, 1, 2, 6, 7.
- Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 2, 8. Shared connection: 2.
- Triangle formed: <2, 3, 4>.

For edge (3, 6):
- Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 0, 1, 2, 4, 7.
- Vertex 6 has connections with vertices 9. No shared connection.

For edge (3, 7):
- Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 0, 1, 2, 4, 6.
- Vertex 7 has connection with vertex 3. Shared connection: 3.
- Triangle formed: <3, 7, 0>.

For edge (4, 2):
- Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 3, 8.
- Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 0, 3, 8, 9. Shared connection: 3.
- Triangle formed: <3, 2, 4>.

For edge (4, 8):
- Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 2, 3.
- Vertex 8 has connections with vertices 0, 2. Shared connection: 2.
- Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>.

For edge (6, 3):
- Vertex 6 has connection with vertex 9.
- Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 0, 1, 2, 4, 7.
- Shared connection: 3.
- Triangle formed: <3, 6, 9>.

For edge (6, 9):
- Vertex 6 has connection with vertex 3.
- Vertex 9 has connections with vertices 1, 2. No shared connection.

For edge (7, 3):
- Vertex 7 has connection with vertex 3.
- Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 0, 1, 2, 4, 6.
- Shared connection: 3.
- Triangle formed: <3, 7, 0>.

The total number of triangles is [6].
