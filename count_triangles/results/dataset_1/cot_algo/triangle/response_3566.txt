Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: degree 2  
1: degree 4  
2: degree 2  
3: degree 3  
4: degree 1  
5: degree 3  
6: degree 2  
7: degree 2  
8: degree 2  
9: degree 4  

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

4: degree 1  
0: degree 2  
2: degree 2  
6: degree 2  
7: degree 2  
8: degree 2  
3: degree 3  
5: degree 3  
1: degree 4  
9: degree 4  

Next, we go through each edge to count the number of triangles:

- Edge (0, 1): 1 shares connections with 6 and 9. This forms a triangle <0, 1, 6>.
- Edge (0, 7): 0 shares a connection with 9. This forms a triangle <0, 7, 9>.
- Edge (1, 6): 1 shares a connection with 5. This forms a triangle <1, 5, 6>.
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles.
- Edge (1, 9): 1 shares connections with 0 and 6. This forms a triangle <1, 0, 9> and a triangle <1, 6, 9>.
- Edge (2, 5): No triangles.
- Edge (2, 8): No triangles.
- Edge (3, 4): No triangles.
- Edge (3, 5): 3 shares a connection with 9. This forms a triangle <3, 5, 9>.
- Edge (3, 9): No triangles.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangles.
- Edge (6, 1): 6 shares a connection with 5. This forms a triangle <6, 1, 5>.
- Edge (6, 5): 6 shares a connection with 1. This forms a triangle <6, 1, 5>.
- Edge (7, 0): 7 shares a connection with 9. This forms a triangle <7, 0, 9>.
- Edge (7, 9): No triangles.
- Edge (8, 1): No triangles.
- Edge (8, 2): No triangles.
- Edge (9, 1): No triangles.
- Edge (9, 3): 9 shares connections with 0 and 1. This forms a triangle <9, 0, 1>.
- Edge (9, 7): 9 shares a connection with 0. This forms a triangle <9, 0, 7>.

The total number of triangles inside brackets is [7].
