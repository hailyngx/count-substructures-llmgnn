Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 0 has 5 connections.  
Node 1 has 2 connections.  
Node 5 has 1 connection.  
Node 4 has 3 connections.  
Node 3 has 3 connections.  
Node 2 has 3 connections.  
Node 6 has 4 connections.  
Node 7 has 4 connections.  
Node 8 has 5 connections.  
Node 9 has 3 connections.  

Now, let's count the number of triangles:
Checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (1, 6): Forms triangle with node 0 -> <0, 1, 6>
- (2, 4): No triangle formed
- (2, 7): Forms triangle with node 0 -> <0, 2, 7>
- (2, 9): No triangle formed
- (3, 8): Forms triangle with node 0 -> <0, 3, 8>
- (3, 9): No triangle formed
- (4, 6): No triangle formed
- (6, 8): Forms triangle with node 0 -> <0, 6, 8>
- (7, 8): Forms triangle with node 0 -> <0, 7, 8>
- (8, 9): No triangle formed

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 7, 8>.
