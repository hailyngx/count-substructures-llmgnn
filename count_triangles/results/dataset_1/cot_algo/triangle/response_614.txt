Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Vertex 5 has 4 connections
Vertex 1 has 3 connections
Vertex 2 has 2 connections
Vertex 4 has 2 connections
Vertex 6 has 2 connections
Vertex 3 has 2 connections
Vertex 7 has 2 connections
Vertex 8 has 1 connection
Vertex 9 has 1 connection

Following the rule mentioned earlier, we proceed with the edges in the following order:
(8, 3), (9, 4), (7, 4), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 1), (4, 7), (3, 8), (3, 5), (2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)

Counting the triangles formed by shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 7>

There are a total of [2] triangles in this graph.
