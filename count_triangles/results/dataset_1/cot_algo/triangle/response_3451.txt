Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding connections:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertex ordering: 2, 4, 9, 0, 3, 5, 7, 1

Now, looking at each edge with the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 1): Forms triangle with vertex 3. Triangle <0, 1, 3>.
2. Edge (0, 3): Forms triangle with vertices 1 and 5. Triangle <0, 3, 5>.
3. Edge (0, 4): Forms no triangles.
4. Edge (1, 2): Forms no triangles.
5. Edge (1, 7): Forms triangles with vertices 0 and 3. Triangle <1, 7, 0> and <1, 7, 3>.
6. Edge (1, 9): Forms no triangles.
7. Edge (2, 5): Forms no triangles.
8. Edge (3, 7): Forms no triangles.
9. Edge (3, 9): Forms no triangles.
10. Edge (4, 5): Forms no triangles.
11. Edge (5, 7): Forms triangles with vertices 0 and 3. Triangle <5, 7, 0> and <5, 7, 3>.

Total number of triangles: [4] 
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 7, 3>, <5, 7, 0>, <5, 7, 3>.
