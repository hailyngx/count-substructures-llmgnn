Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Node 4: 0 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges. Only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections will be considered:

1. Edge (0, 1): Forms triangle with node 7. Triangle <0, 1, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 7): No triangles can be formed.
3. Edge (1, 0): No triangles can be formed.
4. Edge (1, 8): No triangles can be formed.
5. Edge (1, 9): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle <1, 2, 9>.
6. Edge (2, 3): Forms triangle with node 5. Triangle <2, 3, 5>.
7. Edge (2, 5): Forms triangle with node 7. Triangle <2, 5, 7>.
8. Edge (2, 7): Forms triangle with node 0. Triangle <0, 2, 7>.
9. Edge (2, 9): Forms triangle with node 1. Triangle <1, 2, 9>.
10. Edge (3, 2): Forms triangle with node 5. Triangle <2, 3, 5>.
11. Edge (3, 5): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle <2, 3, 5>.
12. Edge (3, 9): Forms triangle with node 1. Triangle <1, 3, 9>.
13. Edge (5, 2): Forms triangle with node 7. Triangle <2, 5, 7>.
14. Edge (5, 3): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle <2, 3, 5>.
15. Edge (5, 7): No triangles can be formed.
16. Edge (5, 9): Forms triangle with node 3. Triangle <3, 5, 9>.
17. Edge (7, 0): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle <0, 2, 7>.
18. Edge (7, 2): Forms triangle with node 5. Triangle <2, 5, 7>.
19. Edge (7, 4): No triangles can be formed.
20. Edge (7, 5): No triangles can be formed.
21. Edge (8, 1): No triangles can be formed.
22. Edge (9, 1): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle <1, 2, 9>.
23. Edge (9, 2): Forms triangle with node 1. Triangle <1, 2, 9>.
24. Edge (9, 3): Forms triangle with node 5. Triangle <3, 5, 9>.
25. Edge (9, 5): Forms triangle with node 3. Triangle <3, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
