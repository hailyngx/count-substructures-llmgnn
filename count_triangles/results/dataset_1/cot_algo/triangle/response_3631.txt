Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new ordering and corresponding connections are as follows:
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 5 connections
- Vertex 2: 6 connections
- Vertex 8: 6 connections
- Vertex 0: 7 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now analyze the edges to find triangles.

Triangles:
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>
