Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows:  

Node 0 has degree 1  
Node 1 has degree 2  
Node 3 has degree 2  
Node 4 has degree 1  
Node 5 has degree 2  
Node 9 has degree 2  
Node 6 has degree 4  
Node 8 has degree 4  
Node 2 has degree 5  
Node 7 has degree 5  

Now, we will count the triangles:

For edge (0, 9):  
- Node 0 and Node 9 do not share any common neighbors, so no triangle is formed.

For edge (1, 2):  
- Node 1 and Node 2 do not form a triangle on their own.

For edge (2, 1):  
- Node 1 and Node 2 do not share any common neighbors, so no triangle is formed.

For edge (2, 3):  
- Node 2 and Node 3 form a triangle with Node 6.

For edge (2, 7):  
- Node 2 and Node 7 form a triangle with Node 5.

For edge (2, 9):  
- Node 2 and Node 9 do not share any common neighbors, so no triangle is formed.

For edge (3, 2):  
- Node 2 and Node 3 form a triangle with Node 6.

For edge (3, 6):  
- Node 3 and Node 6 do not share any common neighbors, so no triangle is formed.

For edge (4, 8):  
- Node 4 and Node 8 do not share any common neighbors, so no triangle is formed.

For edge (5, 6):  
- Node 5 and Node 6 do not form a triangle on their own.

For edge (5, 7):  
- Node 5 and Node 7 form a triangle with Node 2.

For edge (6, 3):  
- Node 3 and Node 6 do not share any common neighbors, so no triangle is formed.

For edge (6, 5):  
- Node 5 and Node 6 do not form a triangle on their own.

For edge (6, 8):  
- Node 6 and Node 8 form a triangle with Node 7.

For edge (7, 2):  
- Node 7 and Node 2 form a triangle with Node 5.

For edge (7, 5):  
- Node 5 and Node 7 form a triangle with Node 2.

For edge (7, 8):  
- Node 7 and Node 8 form a triangle with Node 6.

For edge (8, 4):  
- Node 4 and Node 8 do not share any common neighbors, so no triangle is formed.

For edge (8, 6):  
- Node 6 and Node 8 form a triangle with Node 7.

For edge (8, 7):  
- Node 7 and Node 8 form a triangle with Node 6.

For edge (9, 0):  
- Node 0 and Node 9 do not share any common neighbors, so no triangle is formed.

For edge (9, 2):  
- Node 2 and Node 9 do not share any common neighbors, so no triangle is formed.

The total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are:  
<2, 3, 6>  
<2, 5, 7>  
<2, 6, 7>  
<2, 6, 8>  
<5, 7, 8>  
<6, 7, 8>
