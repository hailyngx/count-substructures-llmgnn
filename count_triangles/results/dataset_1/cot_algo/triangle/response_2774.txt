Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: 1 (degree 2), 4 (degree 2), 5 (degree 2), 8 (degree 2), 3 (degree 3), 6 (degree 3), 9 (degree 3), 0 (degree 4), 2 (degree 6), 7 (degree 6)

Next, we will go through each edge and count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 2, 6>
4. <0, 9, 6>
5. <2, 4, 7>
6. <2, 6, 9>
7. <2, 5, 6>
8. <2, 5, 4>
9. <2, 3, 4>
10. <2, 3, 1>
11. <2, 3, 0>
12. <2, 3, 7>
13. <6, 9, 0>
14. <6, 9, 7>
15. <4, 7, 0>
16. <4, 7, 1>
17. <7, 0, 1>

Total number of triangles: [17]
