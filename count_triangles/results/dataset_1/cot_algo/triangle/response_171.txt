Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 1 (Degree 2): 3, 8  
Node 2 (Degree 2): 1, 2  
Node 3 (Degree 2): 0, 9  
Node 4 (Degree 3): 5, 6, 7  
Node 5 (Degree 4): 0, 1, 4, 9  
  
Based on the degree-based ordering, we will start counting triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:  
- Edge (0, 4): shared connections {5} form a triangle with node 5  
- Edge (0, 5): shared connections {} no triangle  
- Edge (0, 9): shared connections {} no triangle  
- Edge (1, 2): shared connections {} no triangle  
- Edge (1, 5): shared connections {} no triangle  
- Edge (1, 7): shared connections {} no triangle  
- Edge (2, 8): shared connections {} no triangle  
- Edge (3, 4): shared connections {} no triangle  
- Edge (3, 7): shared connections {} no triangle  
- Edge (3, 8): shared connections {} no triangle  
- Edge (4, 6): shared connections {} no triangle  
- Edge (4, 7): shared connections {5} form a triangle with node 5  
- Edge (5, 6): shared connections {} no triangle  
- Edge (5, 9): shared connections {} no triangle  
- Edge (7, 9): shared connections {} no triangle  
  
Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles found are:  
<4, 5, 7>  
<0, 4, 5>
