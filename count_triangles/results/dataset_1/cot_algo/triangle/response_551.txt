Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices with their connections:
0: 2, 7
1: 2, 4, 7
3: 6
5: 2, 4, 6
8: 7
9: 4, 6
2: 0, 1, 4, 5
4: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
6: 3, 5, 9
7: 0, 1, 4, 8

Now we relabel the vertices according to the number of connections:
0: 0 connections
1: 0 connections
3: 1 connection
5: 3 connections
8: 1 connection
9: 2 connections
2: 4 connections
4: 5 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 4 connections

We will now count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 2) is valid as 0 has 0 connections < 4 connections on 2 and forms triangles with 1.
- Edge (0, 7) is valid as 0 has 0 connections < 4 connections on 7 and forms triangles with 1.
- Edge (1, 2) is valid as 0 has 0 connections < 4 connections on 2 and forms triangles with 0.
- Edge (1, 4) is valid as 0 has 0 connections < 5 connections on 4 and forms triangles with 2.
- Edge (1, 7) is valid as 0 has 0 connections < 4 connections on 7 and forms triangles with 0.
- Edge (2, 0) is not considered because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (2, 1) is not considered because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (2, 4) is valid as 0 has 0 connections < 5 connections on 4 and forms triangles with 1.
- Edge (2, 5) is valid as 0 has 0 connections < 3 connections on 5 and forms triangles with 0.
- Edge (3, 6) is not considered because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (4, 1) is not considered because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (4, 2) is not considered because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (4, 5) is valid as 2 has 4 connections < 3 connections on 5 and forms triangles with 1.
- Edge (4, 7) is valid as 2 has 4 connections < 4 connections on 7 and forms triangles with 1.
- Edge (4, 9) is valid as 2 has 4 connections < 2 connections on 9 and forms triangles with 5.
- Edge (5, 2) is not considered because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (5, 4) is not considered because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (5, 6) is valid as 5 has 3 connections < 3 connections on 6 and forms triangles with 4.
- Edge (6, 3) is valid as 3 has 1 connection < 3 connections on 6 and forms triangles with 5.
- Edge (6, 5) is valid as 3 has 1 connection < 3 connections on 5 and forms triangles with 4.
- Edge (6, 9) is valid as 3 has 1 connection < 2 connections on 9 and forms triangles with 5.
- Edge (7, 0) is not considered because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (7, 1) is not considered because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (7, 4) is not considered because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (7, 8) is valid as 0 has 0 connections < 1 connection on 8 and forms triangles with 7.
- Edge (8, 7) is valid as 0 has 0 connections < 4 connections on 7 and forms triangles with 0.
- Edge (9, 4) is not considered because the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (9, 6) is valid as 2 has 4 connections < 3 connections on 6 and forms triangles with 3.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] with unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 8>.
