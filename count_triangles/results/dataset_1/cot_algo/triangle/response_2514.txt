Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 3 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 3 connections

Now, we'll relabel the vertices based on the number of connections in ascending order:
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections

Next, using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we'll count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle <3, 4, 8>
