Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 1

Sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, we get the new labeling as follows:
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4

Now, we will explore the edges based on the new labeling to count the triangles. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Counting triangles:
1. Edge (0, 3):
   - Shared connections: 6
   This forms a triangle <0, 3, 6>.

2. Edge (0, 6):
   - Shared connections: 3
   This forms a triangle <0, 6, 3>.

3. Edge (1, 7):
   No triangle formed.

4. Edge (1, 9):
   No triangle formed.

5. Edge (2, 4):
   - Shared connections: None
   No triangle formed.

6. Edge (2, 6):
   - Shared connections: None
   No triangle formed.

7. Edge (3, 6):
   - Shared connections: 0
   No triangle formed.

8. Edge (4, 8):
   - Shared connections: None
   No triangle formed.

9. Edge (6, 2):
   - Shared connections: None
   No triangle formed.

10. Edge (6, 3):
   - Shared connections: 0
   No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 6>
