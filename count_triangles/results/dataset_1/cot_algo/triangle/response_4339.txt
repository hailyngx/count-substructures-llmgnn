Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new order is: <3, 8, 4, 5, 7, 1, 6, 0, 9, 2>. 
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the triangles and count them:

Triangles: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 9>
Total number of triangles: [4]
