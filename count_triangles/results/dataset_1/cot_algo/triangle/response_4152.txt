Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections they have. Then, we can relabel the vertices from 0 to 9 according to their degree:

Vertex 0 has 5 connections.
Vertex 1 has 3 connections.
Vertex 4 has 4 connections.
Vertex 6 has 4 connections.
Vertex 5 has 3 connections.
Vertex 7 has 4 connections.
Vertex 2 has 5 connections.
Vertex 3 has 6 connections.
Vertex 8 has 6 connections.
Vertex 9 has 2 connections.

Now, we can iterate through the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections. By doing this, we can count the number of triangles formed:

- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with 0 and 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with 0 and 2: <0, 2, 3>
- Edge (0, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with 0 and 7: <0, 7, 6>
- Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle with 0 and 8: <0, 8, 4>
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 5) forms a triangle with 3 and 5: <3, 5, 6>
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) forms a triangle with 4 and 6: <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) forms a triangle with 5 and 6: <5, 6, 8>
- Edge (6, 7) forms a triangle with 6 and 7: <6, 7, 0>
- Edge (6, 8) forms a triangle with 6 and 8: <6, 8, 4>
- Edge (7, 8) forms a triangle with 7 and 8: <7, 8, 0>
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.

Counting the number of unique triangles found, we have the following list:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 8, 4>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 0>, <7, 8, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
