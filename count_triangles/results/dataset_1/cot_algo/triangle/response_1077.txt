Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices: 6, 1, 8, 0, 4, 7, 3, 9, 5, 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 6 is relabeled as 0 (it has 0 connections)
Vertex 1 is relabeled as 1 (it has 1 connection)
Vertex 8 is relabeled as 2 (it has 2 connections)
Vertex 0 is relabeled as 3 (it has 4 connections)
Vertex 4 is relabeled as 4 (it has 4 connections)
Vertex 7 is relabeled as 5 (it has 4 connections)
Vertex 3 is relabeled as 6 (it has 4 connections)
Vertex 9 is relabeled as 7 (it has 5 connections)
Vertex 5 is relabeled as 8 (it has 5 connections)
Vertex 2 is relabeled as 9 (it has 5 connections)

Now, we will check each edge and count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 3): As vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 0, we proceed.
  - Shared connections: 5
  - Triangle: <0, 3, 5>

- Edge (0, 5): As vertex 5 has fewer connections than vertex 0, we proceed.
  - Shared connections: 3
  - Triangle: <0, 5, 3>

- Edge (0, 7): As vertex 7 has equal connections to vertex 0, we do not proceed.

- Edge (0, 9): As vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 0, we do not proceed.

- Edge (1, 2): As vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 2, we proceed.
  - Shared connections: None

- Edge (1, 7): As vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 1, we do not proceed.

- Edge (2, 1): As vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 2, we proceed.
  - Shared connections: None

- Edge (2, 4): As vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 2, we proceed.
  - Shared connections: None

- Edge (2, 5): As vertex 5 has less connections than vertex 2, we proceed.
  - Shared connections: 3
  - Triangle: <2, 5, 0>

- Edge (2, 9): As vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 2, we do not proceed.

- Edge (3, 4): As vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 3, we do not proceed.

- Edge (3, 5): As vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 3, we do not proceed.

- Edge (4, 2): As vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 4, we do not proceed.

- Edge (5, 2): As vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 5, we do not proceed.

- Edge (5, 7): As vertex 7 has equal connections to vertex 5, we do not proceed.

- Edge (6, 9): As vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 6, we do not proceed.

- Edge (7, 0): As vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 7, we do not proceed.

- Edge (7, 1): As vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 7, we proceed.
  - Shared connections: None

- Edge (7, 5): As vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 7, we do not proceed.

- Edge (9, 0): As vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 9, we do not proceed.

- Edge (9, 2): As vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 9, we do not proceed.

- Edge (9, 6): As vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 9, we proceed.
  - Shared connections: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5> and <2, 5, 0>.
