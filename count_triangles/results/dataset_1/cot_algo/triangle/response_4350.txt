Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 9 has 1 connection
Node 0 has 2 connections
Node 7 has 2 connections
Node 8 has 2 connections
Node 1 has 3 connections
Node 6 has 3 connections
Node 4 has 4 connections
Node 2 has 5 connections
Node 3 has 5 connections
Node 5 has 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now find the number of triangles in the graph.

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 8, 7>
