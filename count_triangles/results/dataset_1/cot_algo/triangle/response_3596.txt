Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Node 5: 0 connections
Nodes 2 and 9: 1 connection
Nodes 3 and 4: 2 connections
Nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections

Since the vertex with the lower label should have fewer connections in each edge, we proceed with the following edges:
(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 4), (1, 6), (7, 4)

Now, we will check for shared connections to find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 6, 1>
- Triangle 2: <0, 7, 1>
- Triangle 3: <0, 8, 1>
- Triangle 4: <0, 7, 4>
- Triangle 5: <0, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
