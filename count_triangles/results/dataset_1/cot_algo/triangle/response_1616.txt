Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degree:
