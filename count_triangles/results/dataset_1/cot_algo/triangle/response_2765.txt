Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections (degree):
- Vertex 1 is connected to 1 other vertex
- Vertex 4 is connected to 1 other vertex
- Vertex 6 is connected to 1 other vertex
- Vertex 9 is connected to 2 other vertices
- Vertex 2 is connected to 3 other vertices
- Vertex 7 is connected to 3 other vertices
- Vertex 5 is connected to 4 other vertices
- Vertex 0 is connected to 4 other vertices
- Vertex 3 is connected to 5 other vertices
- Vertex 8 is connected to 6 other vertices

2. Relabel the vertices according to their degrees:
- Vertex 1 is now labeled as 0
- Vertex 4 is now labeled as 1
- Vertex 6 is now labeled as 2
- Vertex 9 is now labeled as 3
- Vertex 2 is now labeled as 4
- Vertex 7 is now labeled as 5
- Vertex 5 is now labeled as 6
- Vertex 0 is now labeled as 7
- Vertex 3 is now labeled as 8
- Vertex 8 is now labeled as 9

3. Check the edges (in their sorted order) and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): No triangle
- Edge (0, 3): Forms triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Edge (0, 5): Forms triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Edge (0, 7): Forms triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (1, 8): No triangle
- Edge (2, 8): No triangle
- Edge (3, 0): No triangle
- Edge (3, 5): Forms triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Edge (3, 7): Forms triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (3, 8): Forms triangle <0, 3, 8>
- Edge (4, 8): No triangle
- Edge (5, 0): Forms triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Edge (5, 3): Forms triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Edge (5, 9): No triangle
- Edge (6, 9): No triangle
- Edge (7, 0): Forms triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (7, 3): Forms triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (7, 8): No triangle
- Edge (8, 1): No triangle
- Edge (8, 2): No triangle
- Edge (8, 3): Forms triangle <0, 3, 8>
- Edge (8, 4): No triangle
- Edge (8, 7): No triangle
- Edge (9, 5): No triangle
- Edge (9, 6): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>
