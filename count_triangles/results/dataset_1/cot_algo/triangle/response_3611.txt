Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes based on their degree:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2

Since nodes are already sorted by degree, we can start examining the edges. Each edge will be processed only once.

1. For edge (0, 3), we have:
   - Node 0 has connections with nodes 6, 7, 8
   - Node 3 has connections with nodes 6
   - Nodes 0 and 3 share a connection with node 6
   - Triangle found: <0, 3, 6>

2. For edge (0, 6), we have:
   - Node 0 has connections with nodes 3, 7, 8
   - Node 6 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
   - Nodes 0 and 6 share a connection with nodes 3 and 7
   - Triangles found: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 7>

3. For edge (0, 7), we have:
   - Node 0 has connections with nodes 3, 6, 8
   - Node 7 has connections with nodes 1, 5, 6, 9
   - Nodes 0 and 7 share a connection with node 6
   - Triangle found: <0, 6, 7>

4. For edge (0, 8), we have:
   - Node 0 has connections with nodes 3, 6, 7
   - Node 8 has connections with nodes 5
   - No triangles found.

5. For edge (1, 4), we have:
   - Node 1 has connections with nodes 7
   - Node 4 has connections with nodes 5, 6
   - No triangles found.

6. For edge (1, 7), we have:
   - Node 1 has connections with nodes 4
   - Node 7 has connections with nodes 0, 5, 6, 9
   - No triangles found.

7. For edge (2, 5), we have:
   - Node 2 has connections with nodes 6
   - Node 5 has connections with nodes 4, 7, 8, 9
   - No triangles found.

8. For edge (2, 6), we have:
   - Node 2 has connections with nodes 5
   - Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
   - No triangles found.

9. For the remaining edges, no triangles are found as nodes with lower labels do not have fewer connections.

Total number of triangles: [2]
