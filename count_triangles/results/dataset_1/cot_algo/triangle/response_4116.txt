Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph would be: 

Node 6: 0 connections
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections 
Node 3: 5 connections 
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
After checking for shared connections between vertices of each edge, the total number of triangles is [5], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 8>.
