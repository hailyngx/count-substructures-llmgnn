Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted vertices are as follows:
Vertices: 0(3), 4(1), 6(3), 7(3), 2(4), 8(3), 5(5), 3(5), 1(6), 9(4)

Now, we will identify the triangles formed by the edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For edge (0, 1), as vertex 0 and vertex 1 both have fewer connections, we check for shared connections. We find that vertex 0 and vertex 1 have a shared connection with vertex 5, forming a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- For edge (0, 5), as vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 5, we do not proceed.
- For edge (0, 6), as vertex 0 and vertex 6 both have the same number of connections, we do not proceed.
- Similarly, we continue this process for all the edges.

After going through all the edges, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 9>, <7, 8, 3>, <8, 9, 5>
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
