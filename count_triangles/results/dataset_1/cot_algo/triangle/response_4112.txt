Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 
- Node 4 (Degree 0)
- Node 9 (Degree 1)
- Node 2 (Degree 2)
- Node 3 (Degree 3)
- Node 5 (Degree 3)
- Node 1 (Degree 4)
- Node 6 (Degree 4)
- Node 8 (Degree 4)
- Node 0 (Degree 5)
- Node 7 (Degree 4)

Considering the edges in the order provided, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles found: 
- <0, 5, 8>
- <1, 3, 7>

Total number of triangles: [2]
