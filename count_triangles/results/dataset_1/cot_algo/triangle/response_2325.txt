Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 1 has 1 connection.
