Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 6
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 4

Now, we will sort the nodes by their degrees in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:
- Node 8 (degree 1)
- Node 0 (degree 2)
- Node 3 (degree 3)
- Node 4 (degree 3)
- Node 6 (degree 3)
- Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 9 (degree 4)
- Node 7 (degree 5)
- Node 2 (degree 6)

Next, we will iterate through each edge and count the triangles. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- <3, 6, 7> (Shared connection: 7)
- <3, 6, 7> (Already counted)
- <4, 5, 7> (Shared connection: 5)
- <4, 5, 7> (Already counted)
- <1, 2, 7> (Shared connection: 2)
- <1, 2, 7> (Already counted)
- <1, 5, 7> (Shared connection: 5)
- <1, 5, 7> (Already counted)
- <2, 6, 7> (Shared connection: 2)
- <2, 6, 7> (Already counted)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
