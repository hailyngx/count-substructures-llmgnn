Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the order becomes: 

1. Node 2: Connected to 0 nodes
2. Node 1: Connected to 2 nodes
3. Node 7: Connected to 2 nodes
4. Node 3: Connected to 3 nodes
5. Node 5: Connected to 4 nodes
6. Node 4: Connected to 5 nodes
7. Node 9: Connected to 5 nodes
8. Node 8: Connected to 5 nodes
9. Node 6: Connected to 6 nodes
10. Node 0: Connected to 6 nodes

Now, analyzing the graph based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle with shared connection 5. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
Edge (0, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection 4. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
Edge (0, 6): Forms a triangle with shared connection 9. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
Edge (0, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 6. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
Edge (1, 6): Forms a triangle with shared connection 11. Triangle <1, 6, 11>
Edge (3, 6): Forms a triangle with shared connection 8. Triangle <3, 6, 8>
Edge (3, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection 6. Triangle <3, 6, 8>
Edge (4, 0): Skipped as Node 4 has more connections
Edge (4, 5): Skipped as Node 5 has more connections
Edge (4, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection 6. Triangle <4, 6, 8>
Edge (5, 0): Skipped as Node 5 has more connections
Edge (5, 4): Skipped as Node 5 has more connections
Edge (5, 6): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0. Triangle <5, 0, 6>
Edge (6, 0): Skipped as Node 6 has more connections
Edge (6, 1): Skipped as Node 6 has more connections
Edge (6, 3): Skipped as Node 6 has more connections
Edge (6, 5): Skipped as Node 6 has more connections
Edge (6, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection 4 and 5. Triangles <6, 4, 8> and <6, 5, 8>
Edge (6, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0. Triangle <6, 0, 9>
Edge (7, 9): Skipped as Node 7 has more connections
Edge (8, 3): Skipped as Node 8 has more connections
Edge (8, 4): Skipped as Node 8 has more connections
Edge (8, 6): Skipped as Node 8 has more connections
Edge (8, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 6. Triangle <8, 6, 9>
Edge (9, 0): Skipped as Node 9 has more connections
Edge (9, 6): Skipped as Node 9 has more connections
Edge (9, 7): Skipped as Node 9 has more connections
Edge (9, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection 6. Triangle <9, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 11>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 0, 6>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 5, 8>, <6, 0, 9>, <8, 6, 9>.
