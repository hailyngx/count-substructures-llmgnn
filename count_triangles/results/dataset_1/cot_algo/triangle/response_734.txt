Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degrees:

- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 1
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 3
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 5
- Vertex 7: degree 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

- Vertex 9: 0
- Vertex 6: 1
- Vertex 8: 2
- Vertex 1: 3
- Vertex 0: 4
- Vertex 5: 5
- Vertex 2: 6
- Vertex 3: 7
- Vertex 7: 8
- Vertex 4: 9

Next, we will check each edge following the method described earlier to count the number of triangles. I will list the triangles found in the graph:

- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <5, 6, 7>

Finally, we count the total number of triangles:
