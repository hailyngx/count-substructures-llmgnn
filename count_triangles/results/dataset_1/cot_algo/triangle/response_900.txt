Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied as follows:

Node 6 has 0 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.
Node 0 has 5 connections. 
Node 2 has 5 connections.
Node 8 has 6 connections.
Node 5 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with (0) and (2) are (7), (8), forming triangle <0, 2, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 4): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (0, 7): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (2, 0): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (2, 7): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (3, 8): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (4, 0): No triangles formed.
15. Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (5, 0): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (5, 1): No triangles formed.
18. Edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.
19. Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.
20. Edge (7, 0): No triangles formed.
21. Edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.
22. Edge (7, 2): No triangles formed.
23. Edge (8, 1): No triangles formed.
24. Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed.
25. Edge (8, 3): No triangles formed.
26. Edge (8, 5): No triangles formed.
27. Edge (9, 3): No triangles formed.
28. Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 7>
