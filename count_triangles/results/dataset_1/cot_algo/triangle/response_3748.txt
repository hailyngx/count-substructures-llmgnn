Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections), we have:
Vertices: 7, 4, 2, 3, 9, 0, 6, 5, 8, 1

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we consider edges only where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

For vertex 7 (degree 1):
No triangles can be formed using this vertex.

For vertex 4 (degree 2):
No triangles can be formed using this vertex.

For vertex 2 (degree 2):
No triangles can be formed using this vertex.

For vertex 3 (degree 2):
No triangles can be formed using this vertex.

For vertex 9 (degree 3):
No triangles can be formed using this vertex.

For vertex 0 (degree 4):
No triangles can be formed using this vertex.

For vertex 6 (degree 4):
No triangles can be formed using this vertex.

For vertex 5 (degree 5):
<0, 1, 5>

For vertex 8 (degree 6):
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

For vertex 1 (degree 8):
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 1, 6>
<4, 1, 8>
<5, 1, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
