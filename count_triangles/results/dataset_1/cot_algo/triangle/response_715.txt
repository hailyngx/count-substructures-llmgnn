Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 6: 0 connections
Node 8: 0 connections
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges based on the labels of the vertices.
