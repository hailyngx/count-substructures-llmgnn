Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their degrees, we get: 
Vertices: 4, 6, 7, 0, 3, 6, 7, 5, 8, 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 
After examining the edges, we find that there are 7 triangles in total. 

The triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 1, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 9, 8>
<8, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
