Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new vertex labels are: 
- 0 (degree 1)
- 9 (degree 1)
- 4 (degree 2)
- 5 (degree 2)
- 6 (degree 2)
- 2 (degree 3)
- 7 (degree 4)
- 1 (degree 5)
- 3 (degree 6)
- 8 (degree 8)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph. 

Calculating the triangles:
- Triangle <3, 8, 7>
- Triangle <3, 8, 1>
- Triangle <3, 8, 6>
- Triangle <3, 8, 4>
- Triangle <3, 2, 5>
- Triangle <8, 4, 7>
- Triangle <8, 7, 0>
- Triangle <8, 7, 1>
- Triangle <8, 7, 6>
- Triangle <8, 1, 6>
- Triangle <8, 1, 0>

Total number of triangles: [11]
