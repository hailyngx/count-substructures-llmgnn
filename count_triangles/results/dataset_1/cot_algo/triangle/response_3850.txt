Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 5: 8 connections
Node 8: 3 connections

Now, we will go through the edges in order to count the triangles formed:

1. (0, 1): Since node 0 has 2 connections and node 1 has 6 connections, we proceed.
2. (0, 5): Node 0 and node 5 share a connection with node 1, forming a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
3. (1, 4): Node 1 and node 4 share a connection with node 5, forming a triangle <1, 4, 5>.
4. (1, 5): Node 1 and node 5 already share a connection, forming a triangle <1, 0, 5>.
5. Continue with the rest of the edges to find more triangles.

After examining all edges, we count a total of 7 triangles in the graph:

[7]

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 0, 5>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 8, 2>
<4, 1, 5>
<9, 2, 7>
