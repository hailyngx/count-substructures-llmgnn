Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degrees of each vertex are as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 1
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 3

Now, let's relabel the vertices according to their degrees in non-decreasing order:
- Vertex 2: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method by considering the edges given in the graph:
- (0, 5): Check for shared connections with vertices 0 and 5. Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle: <0, 5, 1>
- (0, 9): Proceed since vertex 0 has fewer connections. No triangles are formed.
- (1, 2): Proceed since vertex 1 has fewer connections. No triangles are formed.
- (1, 5): Check for shared connections with vertices 1 and 5. Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle: <1, 5, 0>
- (1, 8): Proceed since vertex 1 has fewer connections. No triangles are formed.
- (2, 1): Proceed since vertex 2 has fewer connections. No triangles are formed.
- (3, 6): Check for shared connections with vertices 3 and 6. Shared connection with vertex 6 forms a triangle: <3, 6, 8>
- (3, 7): Check for shared connections with vertices 3 and 7. Shared connection with vertex 7 forms a triangle: <3, 7, 9>
- (3, 9): Check for shared connections with vertices 3 and 9. Shared connection with vertex 9 forms a triangle: <3, 9, 7>
- (4, 5): Check for shared connections with vertices 4 and 5. Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle: <4, 5, 0>
- (5, 0): Check for shared connections with vertices 5 and 0. Shared connection with vertex 0 forms a triangle: <5, 0, 1>
- (5, 1): Check for shared connections with vertices 5 and 1. Shared connection with vertex 1 forms a triangle: <5, 1, 0>
- (5, 4): Check for shared connections with vertices 5 and 4. Shared connection with vertex 4 forms a triangle: <5, 4, 0>
- (6, 3): Check for shared connections with vertices 6 and 3. Shared connection with vertex 3 forms a triangle: <6, 3, 9>
- (6, 8): Check for shared connections with vertices 6 and 8. Shared connection with vertex 8 forms a triangle: <6, 8, 1>
- (7, 3): Check for shared connections with vertices 7 and 3. Shared connection with vertex 3 forms a triangle: <7, 3, 9>
- (7, 9): Check for shared connections with vertices 7 and 9. Shared connection with vertex 9 forms a triangle: <7, 9, 3>
- (8, 1): Check for shared connections with vertices 8 and 1. Shared connection with vertex 1 forms a triangle: <8, 1, 5>
- (8, 6): Check for shared connections with vertices 8 and 6. Shared connection with vertex 6 forms a triangle: <8, 6, 3>
- (9, 0): Check for shared connections with vertices 9 and 0. Shared connection with vertex 0 forms a triangle: <9, 0, 5>
- (9, 3): Check for shared connections with vertices 9 and 3. Shared connection with vertex 3 forms a triangle: <9, 3, 7>
- (9, 7): Check for shared connections with vertices 9 and 7. Shared connection with vertex 7 forms a triangle: <9, 7, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [19].
