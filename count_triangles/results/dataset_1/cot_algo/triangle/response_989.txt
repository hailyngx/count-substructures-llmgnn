Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the vertices are labeled as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we go through each edge in the graph to count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 3): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 4): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 3): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 4): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 0): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 5): Triangle formed: <3, 5, 4>
- Edge (4, 1): No triangles formed
- Edge (4, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (4, 5): Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>
- Edge (4, 6): No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 3): Triangle formed: <5, 3, 2>
- Edge (5, 4): Triangle formed: <5, 4, 6>
- Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (6, 4): No triangles formed
- Edge (6, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (6, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 6): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 9): Triangle formed: <8, 9, 6>
- Edge (9, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed
- Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (9, 8): No triangles formed

Total number of triangles formed: [4]
Unique triangles found:
<3, 5, 4>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 3, 2>
<8, 9, 6>
