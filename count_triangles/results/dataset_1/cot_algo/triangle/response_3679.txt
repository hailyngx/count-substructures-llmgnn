Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order:

Vertices: (Degree)
1: (0)
8: (1)
9: (1)
7: (2)
5: (2)
4: (2)
2: (2)
3: (3)
0: (5)

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
Vertex 1 with degree 0 is now labeled 0
Vertex 8 with degree 1 is now labeled 1
Vertex 9 with degree 1 is now labeled 2
Vertex 7 with degree 2 is now labeled 3
Vertex 5 with degree 2 is now labeled 4
Vertex 4 with degree 2 is now labeled 5
Vertex 2 with degree 2 is now labeled 6
Vertex 3 with degree 3 is now labeled 7
Vertex 0 with degree 5 is now labeled 8

Now, let's count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method:

Triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 4>
