Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following order: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 1, 0, 5, 2, 9.

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For vertex 3:
   - No triangles can be formed as vertex 3 only has 1 connection.

2. For vertex 4:
   - Triangle <4, 7, 9> is formed.

3. For vertex 6:
   - No triangles can be formed as vertex 6 only has 2 connections.

4. For vertex 7:
   - No triangles can be formed as vertex 7 only has 2 connections.

5. For vertex 8:
   - Triangle <1, 8, 9> is formed.

6. For vertex 1:
   - No triangles can be formed with the current vertices.

7. For vertex 0:
   - No triangles can be formed with the current vertices.

8. For vertex 5:
   - Triangles <0, 5, 9> and <2, 5, 9> are formed.

9. For vertex 2:
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5> is formed.

10. For vertex 9:
   - No more triangles can be formed with the current vertices.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <4, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, and <2, 5, 9>.
