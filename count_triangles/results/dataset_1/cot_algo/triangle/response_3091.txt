Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given graph and the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices can be sorted as follows:

Vertices by degree:
1. Vertex 1: 1 connection
2. Vertex 3: 1 connection
3. Vertex 7: 1 connection
4. Vertex 8: 1 connection
5. Vertex 9: 1 connection
6. Vertex 2: 0 connections
7. Vertex 6: 3 connections
8. Vertex 5: 4 connections
9. Vertex 4: 5 connections
10. Vertex 0: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start examining the edges based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections. 

Checking each edge with the corresponding vertex labels:

Edge (1, 9): Both vertices have only 1 connection, no triangle.
Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 has 6 connections, and Vertex 3 has 1 connection, no triangle.
Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 has 6 connections, and Vertex 4 has 5 connections. Shared connections: 6, forming a triangle with vertices 0, 4, 6.
Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 has 6 connections, and Vertex 6 has 3 connections. Shared connections: 1, 5, forming a triangle with vertices 0, 6, 5.
Edge (3, 0): Already counted.
Edge (4, 0): Already counted.
Edge (4, 5): Vertex 4 has 5 connections, and Vertex 5 has 4 connections. Shared connections: 6, forming a triangle with vertices 4, 5, 0.
Edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 has 5 connections, and Vertex 7 has 1 connection, no triangle.
Edge (8, 5): Vertex 8 has 1 connection, and Vertex 5 has 4 connections, no triangle.
Edge (5, 6): Vertex 5 has 4 connections, and Vertex 6 has 3 connections. Shared connections: 0, forming a triangle with vertices 5, 6, 0.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 5>, and <4, 5, 0>.
