Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is:  

- Vertex 5 has 0 connection(s).
- Vertex 2 has 1 connection(s).
- Vertex 9 has 2 connection(s).
- Vertex 6 has 2 connection(s).
- Vertex 0 has 3 connection(s).
- Vertex 1 has 3 connection(s).
- Vertex 7 has 4 connection(s).
- Vertex 3 has 6 connection(s).
- Vertex 4 has 6 connection(s).
- Vertex 8 has 6 connection(s).

Now, we iterate through each edge considering the lower labeled vertex to count the triangles.

Based on the connections, the triangles found are:

- <1, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
