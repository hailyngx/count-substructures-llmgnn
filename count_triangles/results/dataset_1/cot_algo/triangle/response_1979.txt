Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0 - 2 connections
Node 2 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 1 connection
Node 7 - 2 connections
Node 8 - 2 connections
Node 9 - 2 connections
Node 3 - 2 connections
Node 4 - 3 connections
Node 6 - 4 connections
Node 1 - 6 connections

Relabeling the nodes accordingly:
Node 0 (2 connections) -> A
Node 2 (2 connections) -> B
Node 5 (1 connection) -> C
Node 7 (2 connections) -> D
Node 8 (2 connections) -> E
Node 9 (2 connections) -> F
Node 3 (2 connections) -> G
Node 4 (3 connections) -> H
Node 6 (4 connections) -> I
Node 1 (6 connections) -> J

Now, let's identify the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 (A) has connections with Nodes 1 (J) and 6 (I), forming triangle <0, 1, 6>.
2. Edge (0, 6): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 4): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 (J) has connections with Nodes 0 (A) and 6 (I), forming triangle <0, 1, 6>.
7. Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (6, 8): No triangles formed.
15. Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>
