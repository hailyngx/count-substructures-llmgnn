Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connected:

Vertices: 3, 7, 5, 1, 6, 0, 8, 9, 4, 2

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Checking (0, 2): No triangles
Checking (0, 6): No triangles
Checking (0, 8): No triangles
Checking (1, 3): No triangles
Checking (1, 6): No triangles
Checking (1, 8): No triangles
Checking (2, 0): No triangles
Checking (2, 4): No triangles
Checking (2, 5): No triangles
Checking (2, 9): No triangles
Checking (3, 1): No triangles
Checking (3, 7): No triangles
Checking (4, 2): No triangles
Checking (4, 5): No triangles
Checking (4, 8): No triangles
Checking (4, 9): No triangles
Checking (5, 2): No triangles
Checking (5, 4): <2, 4, 5>
Checking (6, 0): No triangles
Checking (6, 1): No triangles
Checking (6, 7): No triangles
Checking (7, 3): No triangles
Checking (7, 6): No triangles
Checking (8, 0): No triangles
Checking (8, 1): No triangles
Checking (8, 4): No triangles
Checking (8, 9): No triangles
Checking (9, 2): No triangles
Checking (9, 4): No triangles
Checking (9, 7): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1] and the unique triangle found is <2, 4, 5>.
