Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has been provided with the edges between the nodes. Now, let's follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1):
   - Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
   - Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
   - Node 0 and node 1 share connections with nodes 6, 8, and 9.
   - Possible triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>.

2. Continuing for all edges, we find more triangles.

After accounting for all triangles, we get the total number of triangles as [16].

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 9>.
