Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their number of connections. In this case, the sorted list of nodes based on their degrees is as follows:  

Node 7 (degree: 1)  
Nodes 1, 2, 5, 7 (degree: 0)  
Nodes 0, 6 (degree: 3)  
Nodes 4, 9 (degree: 4)  
Node 3 (degree: 5)  
Node 8 (degree: 6)  

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles based on the method mentioned earlier.  

1. Edge (0, 1):  
    - Node 0 (degree 3) has a connection with Node 1 (degree 0).  
    - No triangles formed with this edge.  

2. Edge (0, 3):  
    - Node 0 (degree 3) has a connection with Node 3 (degree 5).  
    - Shared connections of Node 0, 3: [8]. Triangle: <0, 3, 8>  

3. Edge (0, 8):  
    - Node 0 (degree 3) has a connection with Node 8 (degree 6).  
    - No triangles formed with this edge.  

4. Edge (1, 0):  
    - We skip this edge since Node 0 (degree 3) has more connections than Node 1 (degree 0).  

5. Edge (2, 3):  
    - We skip this edge since both Node 2 and Node 3 have the same number of connections.  

6. Edge (3, 0):  
    - We skip this edge since both Node 0 and Node 3 were already processed.  

7. Edge (3, 2):  
    - We skip this edge since Node 2 (degree 0) has fewer connections than Node 3 (degree 5).  

8. Edge (3, 4):  
    - Node 3 (degree 5) has a connection with Node 4 (degree 4).  
    - No triangles formed with this edge.  

9. Edge (3, 5):  
    - Node 3 (degree 5) has a connection with Node 5 (degree 3).  
    - No triangles formed with this edge.  

10. Edge (3, 8):  
    - Node 3 (degree 5) has a connection with Node 8 (degree 6).  
    - Shared connections of Node 3, 8: [0, 4]. Triangles: <3, 8, 0>, <3, 8, 4>  

The remaining edges are skipped as they either connect nodes with equal degrees or do not meet the criteria for triangle formation.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].  
The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 8>, <3, 8, 0>, <3, 8, 4>.
