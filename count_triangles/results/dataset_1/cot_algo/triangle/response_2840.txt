Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 1

Next, we rearrange the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 1
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Checking (0, 1): Both vertices have degrees greater than 2.
- Checking (0, 6): Node 0 has degree 2, Node 6 has degree 2. They have a common neighbor (4). So, we find a triangle <0, 4, 6>.
- Checking (1, 0): Both vertices have degrees greater than 2.
- Checking (1, 2): Node 1 has degree 3, Node 2 has degree 1. They have a common neighbor (7). So, we find a triangle <1, 2, 7>.
- Checking (1, 7): Node 1 has degree 3, Node 7 has degree 5. They have two common neighbors (3, 4). So, we find two triangles <1, 3, 7> and <1, 4, 7>.
- Checking (2, 1): Both vertices have degrees greater than 2.
- Checking (3, 5): Both vertices have degrees greater than 2.
- Checking (3, 7): Node 3 has degree 2, Node 7 has degree 5. They have a common neighbor (1). So, we find a triangle <3, 1, 7>.
- Checking (4, 6): Node 4 has degree 2, Node 6 has degree 2. They have a common neighbor (0). So, we find a triangle <4, 0, 6>.
- Checking (4, 7): Node 4 has degree 2, Node 7 has degree 5. They have two common neighbors (1, 3). So, we find two triangles <4, 1, 7> and <4, 3, 7>.
- Checking (5, 3): Both vertices have degrees greater than 2.
- Checking (6, 0): Node 6 has degree 2, Node 0 has degree 2. They have a common neighbor (4). So, we find a triangle <6, 0, 4>.
- Checking (6, 4): Both vertices have degrees greater than 2.
- Checking (7, 1): Node 7 has degree 5, Node 1 has degree 3. They have two common neighbors (3, 4). So, we find two triangles <7, 3, 1> and <7, 4, 1>.
- Checking (7, 3): Node 7 has degree 5, Node 3 has degree 2. They have a common neighbor (1). So, we find a triangle <7, 1, 3>.
- Checking (7, 4): Node 7 has degree 5, Node 4 has degree 2. They have two common neighbors (1, 3). So, we find two triangles <7, 1, 4> and <7, 3, 4>.
- Checking (7, 9): Both vertices have degrees greater than 2.
- Checking (9, 7): Both vertices have degrees greater than 2.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [14].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <3, 1, 7>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 3, 7>, <6, 0, 4>, <7, 3, 1>, <7, 4, 1>, <7, 1, 3>, <7, 1, 4>, <7, 3, 4>.
