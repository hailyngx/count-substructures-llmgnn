Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the degree of each node in the graph:

- Node 0: degree = 4
- Node 1: degree = 5
- Node 2: degree = 5
- Node 3: degree = 1
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 4
- Node 6: degree = 4
- Node 7: degree = 3
- Node 8: degree = 1
- Node 9: degree = 4

Now, we will reorder the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 3 (degree 1)
- Node 8 (degree 1)
- Node 7 (degree 3)
- Node 0 (degree 4)
- Node 4 (degree 4)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 4)
- Node 9 (degree 4)
- Node 1 (degree 5)
- Node 2 (degree 5)

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Looking at the edges, we can count the triangles based on the ordered nodes:
  - Node 3 and Node 1 have 0 common neighbors.
  - Node 8 and Node 6 have 0 common neighbors.
  - Node 7 and Node 1 have 1 common neighbor (Node 2), forming a triangle <1, 2, 7>.
  - Node 0 and Node 1 have 1 common neighbor (Node 5), forming a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
  - Node 4 and Node 2 have 1 common neighbor (Node 5), forming a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
  - Node 4 and Node 6 have 1 common neighbor (Node 6), forming a triangle <4, 6, 7>.
  - Node 5 and Node 0 have 0 common neighbors.
  - Node 6 and Node 0 have 0 common neighbors.
  - Node 9 and Node 2 have 1 common neighbor (Node 4), forming a triangle <2, 4, 9>.
  - Node 9 and Node 4 have 2 common neighbors (Node 2 and Node 5), forming two triangles <4, 5, 9> and <2, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5], and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 7>, <0, 1, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, and <4, 5, 9>.
