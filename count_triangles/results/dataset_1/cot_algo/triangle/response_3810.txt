Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds in the following way:

1. Sort the vertices by the number of connections:
Vertex 8 has 1 connection.
Vertex 9 has 1 connection.
Vertices 3, 4, and 5 have 2 connections each.
Vertices 1, 7, and 6 have 3 connections each.
Vertices 0 and 2 have 4 connections each.

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 8 (1 connection) -> Vertex A (lowest label)
Vertex 9 (1 connection) -> Vertex B
Vertices 3, 4, 5 (2 connections each) -> Vertices C, D, E
Vertices 1, 7, 6 (3 connections each) -> Vertices F, G, H
Vertices 0, 2 (4 connections each) -> Vertices I, J (highest labels)

3. Check for triangles using the edges:
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 7>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the output would be [5], and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, and <0, 6, 7>.
