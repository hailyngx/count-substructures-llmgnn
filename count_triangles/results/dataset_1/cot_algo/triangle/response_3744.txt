Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following new labels for the vertices: 

- Node 7 has 2 connections.
- Node 2 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 5 and 8 each have 1 connection.
- Node 1 has 2 connections.
- Nodes 9 and 3 each have 3 connections.
- Nodes 0 and 8 have 4 connections.
- Node 6 has 6 connections.
- Node 4 has 7 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:

- For edge (2, 4): No triangle forms.
- For edge (5, 3): No triangle forms.
- For edge (8, 4): No triangle forms.
- For edge (9, 1): No triangle forms.
- For edge (1, 4): No triangle forms.
- For edge (4, 1): No triangle forms.
- For edge (2, 4): No triangle forms.
- For edge (3, 4): No triangle forms.
- For edge (4, 2): No triangle forms.
- For edge (4, 8): No triangle forms.
- For edge (7, 0): No triangle forms.
- For edge (6, 0): No triangle forms.
- For edge (0, 6): No triangle forms.
- For edge (3, 6): No triangle forms.
- For edge (6, 3): No triangle forms.
- For edge (0, 7): No triangle forms.
- For edge (7, 9): No triangle forms.
- For edge (9, 6): No triangle forms.
- For edge (4, 6): Triangle <3, 4, 6> forms.
- For edge (6, 4): Triangle <3, 4, 6> forms.
- For edge (6, 9): Triangle <4, 6, 9> forms.
- For edge (1, 9): No triangle forms.
- For edge (9, 7): No triangle forms.

There are 3 unique triangles found in the graph: <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 9>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
