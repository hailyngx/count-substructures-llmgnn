Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the degree-based ordering for the vertices:

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections

Now, we will list the edges in the order of the nodes' degrees, and check for triangles:

1. (1, 2) - No triangles
2. (7, 8) - No triangles
3. (2, 6) - No triangles
4. (5, 9) - No triangles
5. (4, 3) - Triangle <3, 4, 5>
6. (8, 7) - No triangles
7. (3, 8) - No triangles
8. (6, 7) - No triangles
9. (9, 5) - No triangles
10. (0, 9) - Triangle <0, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2], and the unique triangles are <3, 4, 5> and <0, 4, 9>.
