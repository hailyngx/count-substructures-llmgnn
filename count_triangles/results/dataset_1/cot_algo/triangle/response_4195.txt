Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

The vertices sorted by the number of connections are: <0, 6, 8, 9, 2, 5, 1, 4, 7, 3>.

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

1. Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1. 
2. Edge (0, 7): No triangles as 0 has fewer connections.
3. Edge (1, 3): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0. 
4. Edge (1, 4): No triangles as 1 has fewer connections.
5. Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3. 
6. Edge (1, 8): No triangles as 1 has fewer connections.
7. Edge (2, 3): No triangles as 2 has fewer connections. 
8. Edge (2, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3.
9. Edge (3, 0): No triangles as 3 has more connections. 
10. Edge (3, 1): No triangles as 3 has more connections.
11. Edge (3, 2): No triangles as 3 has more connections.
12. Edge (3, 4): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1.
13. Edge (3, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1 and 2. 
14. Edge (3, 8): No triangles as 3 has more connections.
15. Edge (3, 9): No triangles as 3 has more connections.
16. Edge (4, 1): No triangles as 4 has more connections.
17. Edge (4, 3): No triangles as 4 has more connections.
18. Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0.
19. Edge (5, 1): No triangles as 5 has more connections.
20. Edge (5, 2): No triangles as 5 has more connections.
21. Edge (5, 3): No triangles as 5 has more connections.
22. Edge (5, 6): No triangles as 5 has more connections.
23. Edge (6, 5): No triangles as 6 has fewer connections. 
24. Edge (6, 7): No triangles as 6 has fewer connections.
25. Edge (7, 0): No triangles as 7 has more connections. 
26. Edge (7, 4): No triangles as 7 has more connections.
27. Edge (7, 6): No triangles as 7 has more connections.
28. Edge (7, 9): No triangles as 7 has more connections.
29. Edge (8, 1): No triangles as 8 has fewer connections.
30. Edge (8, 3): No triangles as 8 has fewer connections. 
31. Edge (9, 3): No triangles as 9 has fewer connections.
32. Edge (9, 7): No triangles as 9 has fewer connections.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 7>.
