Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 9: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 5
- Vertex 5: degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now analyze the edges starting from the vertex with the lower label. 

Triangles found:
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 4]
