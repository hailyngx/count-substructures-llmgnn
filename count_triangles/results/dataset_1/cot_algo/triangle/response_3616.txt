Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph. Here's how to find the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree:
   - Vertex 0: degree 2
   - Vertex 1: degree 3
   - Vertex 2: degree 2
   - Vertex 3: degree 2
   - Vertex 4: degree 1
   - Vertex 5: degree 1
   - Vertex 6: degree 2
   - Vertex 8: degree 2
   - Vertex 9: degree 4

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degree:
   - Vertex 0 (degree 2) becomes vertex 0
   - Vertex 2 (degree 2) becomes vertex 1
   - Vertex 6 (degree 2) becomes vertex 2
   - Vertex 3 (degree 2) becomes vertex 3
   - Vertex 8 (degree 2) becomes vertex 4
   - Vertex 1 (degree 3) becomes vertex 5
   - Vertex 9 (degree 4) becomes vertex 6
   - Vertex 4 (degree 1) becomes vertex 7
   - Vertex 5 (degree 1) becomes vertex 8

3. With the new labels, the edges are:
   - (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 2) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5)

4. Counting the triangles:
   - Total triangles: [5]
   
5. Unique triangles:
   - <0, 1, 5>
   - <1, 2, 6>
   - <1, 4, 5>
   - <1, 4, 6>
   - <4, 5, 6>
