Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeling of nodes: 
Node 2 < Node 3 < Node 1 < Node 6 < Node 5 < Node 7 < Node 9 < Node 8 < Node 0 < Node 4.

Now, let's count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering:
- Edge (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 9) - One triangle <2, 9, 7>.
- Edge (3, 4) - One triangle <3, 4, 7>.
- Edge (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 9) - No triangle formed.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is: [2]
