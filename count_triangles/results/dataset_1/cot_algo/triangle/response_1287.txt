Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have the following order: 

Node 7 - Degree: 1
Node 0 - Degree: 1
Node 6 - Degree: 2
Node 1 - Degree: 2
Node 7 - Degree: 2
Node 3 - Degree: 2
Node 4 - Degree: 3
Node 5 - Degree: 4
Node 8 - Degree: 4
Node 9 - Degree: 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through the edges and count the triangles formed:

1. (0, 9): No triangles can be formed.
2. (1, 5): No triangles can be formed.
3. (1, 9): No triangles can be formed.
4. (2, 4): No triangles can be formed.
5. (2, 8): No triangles can be formed.
6. (2, 9): Triangle <2, 8, 9> can be formed.
7. (3, 5): No triangles can be formed.
8. (3, 6): No triangles can be formed.
9. (4, 2): No triangles can be formed.
10. (4, 7): No triangles can be formed.
11. (5, 1): No triangles can be formed.
12. (5, 3): No triangles can be formed.
13. (5, 6): No triangles can be formed.
14. (5, 8): Triangle <2, 8, 5> can be formed.
15. (6, 3): No triangles can be formed.
16. (6, 5): No triangles can be formed.
17. (7, 4): No triangles can be formed.
18. (8, 2): No triangles can be formed.
19. (8, 5): Triangle <2, 8, 5> is already counted.
20. (8, 9): Triangle <2, 8, 9> is already counted.
21. (9, 0): No triangles can be formed.
22. (9, 1): No triangles can be formed.
23. (9, 2): No triangles can be formed.
24. (9, 8): Triangle <2, 8, 9> is already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], which are <2, 8, 9>, <2, 8, 5>, and <2, 9, 8>.
