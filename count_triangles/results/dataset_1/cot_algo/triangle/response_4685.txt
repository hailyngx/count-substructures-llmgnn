Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by the number of connections:
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 3: Degree 2
- Node 9: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 6
- Node 2: Degree 6
- Node 0: Degree 7

Now, let's calculate the triangles:
Considering the sorted list of vertices, we only proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Triangles involving Node 1:
  - No triangles

- Triangles involving Node 3:
  - No triangles

- Triangles involving Node 9:
  - No triangles

- Triangles involving Node 5:
  - No triangles

- Triangles involving Node 6:
  - No triangles

- Triangles involving Node 4:
  - <2, 4, 6>

- Triangles involving Node 8:
  - <0, 4, 8>
  - <0, 7, 8>

- Triangles involving Node 7:
  - <0, 4, 7>
  - <2, 4, 7>

- Triangles involving Node 2:
  - <0, 2, 7>
  - <2, 7, 8>
  - <4, 7, 8>

- Triangles involving Node 0:
  - <2, 4, 0>
  - <4, 7, 0>
  - <7, 8, 0>
  - <2, 7, 0>

Counting the total number of triangles: [9]
