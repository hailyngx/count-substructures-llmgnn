Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied as follows:

Node degrees:
Node 0: 3
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 2
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 2

Sorted by degree:
Nodes: 2, 7, 9, 1, 0, 5, 4, 8, 6

Now, we will identify the triangles:
Triangles: [<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [6]
