Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:  

Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 5: 2 connections  
Node 1: 2 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 0: 4 connections  

Now, by following the degree-based ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:

- Triangle <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <3, 0, 6>
- Triangle <9, 0, 6>
- Triangle <7, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
