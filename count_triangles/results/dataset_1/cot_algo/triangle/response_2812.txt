Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, we have:
Nodes: [3, 7, 1, 6, 5, 8, 2, 9, 4, 0]

Now, we will count the triangles based on the given edges:

- For node 3 (degree 2):
  - No triangles as it has only 2 connections.

- For node 7 (degree 3):
  - No triangles as it has only 3 connections.

- For node 1 (degree 3):
  - No triangles as it has only 3 connections.

- For node 6 (degree 3):
  - No triangles as it has only 3 connections.

- For node 5 (degree 4):
  - Triangle <2, 5, 4> is found.

- For node 8 (degree 4):
  - Triangle <2, 4, 8> is found.

- For node 2 (degree 6):
  - Triangles <4, 2, 9> and <4, 2, 8> are found.

- For node 9 (degree 5):
  - Triangle <4, 9, 8> is found.

- For node 4 (degree 6):
  - No additional triangles found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
The unique triangles found in this graph are <2, 5, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <4, 2, 9>, <4, 2, 8>, and <4, 9, 8>.
