Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us to easily count the triangles in the graph. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their degree (number of connections) is:  
0 (3 connections) <br>
3 (2 connections) <br>
5 (4 connections) <br>
9 (4 connections) <br>
2 (4 connections) <br>
4 (4 connections) <br>
6 (5 connections) <br>
8 (5 connections) <br>
1 (7 connections) <br>
7 (7 connections) <br>

Starting from the vertex with the fewest connections, we count the triangles:
- For vertex 0: No triangles can be formed.
- For vertex 3: No triangles can be formed.
- For vertex 5: Triangles can be formed with (2, 6, 7) and (4, 6, 8).
- For vertex 9: Triangles can be formed with (1, 7, 8) and (6, 7, 9).
- For vertex 2: Triangles can be formed with (1, 6, 7) and (1, 6, 9).
- For vertex 4: Triangles can be formed with (0, 5, 8) and (5, 6, 8).
- For vertex 6: Triangles can be formed with (1, 7, 9).
- For vertex 8: Triangles can be formed with (1, 7, 9).
- For vertex 1: Triangles can be formed with (6, 7, 9).
- For vertex 7: We have already counted the triangles involving this vertex.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 9>

Remember, each triangle is only listed once in the final total count.
