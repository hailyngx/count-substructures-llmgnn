Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. Here is the sorted list of vertices and their respective degrees:

0: 4 connections
1: 1 connection
2: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 1 connection
6: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 2 connections

Now, we will examine each edge in the order given, only proceeding if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles can be formed by the following edges:
- (0, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 0, and a shared connection 0.
- (0, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 3, 0, and a shared connection 0.
- (0, 5) doesn't form a triangle.
- (0, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 9, 0, and a shared connection 0.
- (1, 0) was already counted.
- (2, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 2, 6, and a shared connection 0.
- (2, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 2, 7, and a shared connection 0.
- (3, 0) was already counted.
- (3, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 3, 8, and a shared connection 0.
- (4, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 4, 6, and a shared connection 0.
- (4, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 4, 8, and a shared connection 0.
- (5, 0) was already counted.
- (6, 2) was already counted.
- (6, 4) was already counted.
- (6, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 6, 7, and a shared connection 0.
- (7, 2) was already counted.
- (7, 6) was already counted.
- (7, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 7, 9, and a shared connection 0.
- (8, 3) was already counted.
- (8, 4) was already counted.
- (9, 0) was already counted.
- (9, 7) was already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, and <6, 7, 9>.
