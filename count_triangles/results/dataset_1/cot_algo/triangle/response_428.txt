Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 7 (0 connections), Node 1 (1 connection), Node 5 (2 connections), Node 6 (2 connections), Node 0 (3 connections), Node 4 (3 connections), Node 8 (4 connections), Node 2 (5 connections), Node 3 (5 connections), Node 9 (5 connections).

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Triangle <2, 0, 3> (shared connection: 2)
- Triangle <2, 0, 5> (shared connection: 0)
- Triangle <2, 3, 9> (shared connection: 3)
- Triangle <4, 2, 9> (shared connection: 2)
- Triangle <4, 8, 5> (shared connection: 8)
- Triangle <4, 8, 6> (shared connection: 8)
- Triangle <8, 6, 2> (shared connection: 8)
- Triangle <8, 6, 5> (shared connection: 8)
- Triangle <8, 9, 2> (shared connection: 8)
- Triangle <8, 9, 4> (shared connection: 8)
- Triangle <9, 2, 3> (shared connection: 2)
- Triangle <9, 2, 4> (shared connection: 2)
- Triangle <9, 4, 8> (shared connection: 4)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13].
