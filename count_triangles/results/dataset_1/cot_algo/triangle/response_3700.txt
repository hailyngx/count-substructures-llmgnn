Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each vertex:
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0 (degree 1) becomes Node 0
- Node 3 (degree 2) becomes Node 1
- Node 4 (degree 2) becomes Node 2
- Node 5 (degree 4) becomes Node 3
- Node 6 (degree 6) becomes Node 4
- Node 7 (degree 1) becomes Node 5
- Node 8 (degree 3) becomes Node 6
- Node 9 (degree 4) becomes Node 7

Now, we consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8)

Based on the degree-based ordering method, we will only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Counting the triangles formed:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
