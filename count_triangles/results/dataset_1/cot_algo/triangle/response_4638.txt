Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are: 
0, 7, 4, 2, 8, 3, 5, 9, 6, 1

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 1) (0:0 connections, 1:4 connections) doesn't form a triangle.
2. Edge (1, 0) has already been considered.
3. Edge (1, 3) (1:4 connections, 3:2 connections) forms a triangle with node 1, 3, and a common neighbor 6 <1, 3, 6>.
4. Edge (1, 6) (1:4 connections, 6:5 connections) forms a triangle with node 1, 6, and a common neighbor 5 <1, 6, 5>.
5. Edge (1, 7) (1:4 connections, 7:0 connections) doesn't form a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 6) (2:2 connections, 6:5 connections) forms a triangle with node 2, 6, and a common neighbor 8 <2, 6, 8>.
7. Edge (2, 8) (2:2 connections, 8:2 connections) doesn't form a triangle.
8. Edge (3, 1) has already been considered.
9. Edge (3, 9) (3:2 connections, 9:4 connections) doesn't form a triangle.
10. Edge (4, 5) (4:0 connections, 5:4 connections) doesn't form a triangle.
11. Edge (5, 4) has already been considered.
12. Edge (5, 6) (5:4 connections, 6:5 connections) forms a triangle with node 5, 6, and a common neighbor 9 <5, 6, 9>.
13. Edge (5, 9) (5:4 connections, 9:4 connections) doesn't form a triangle.
14. Edge (6, 1) has already been considered.
15. Edge (6, 2) has already been considered.
16. Edge (6, 5) has already been considered.
17. Edge (6, 8) (6:5 connections, 8:2 connections) doesn't form a triangle.
18. Edge (6, 9) (6:5 connections, 9:4 connections) forms a triangle with node 6, 9, and a common neighbor 5 <6, 9, 5>.
19. Edge (7, 1) has already been considered.
20. Edge (8, 2) has already been considered.
21. Edge (8, 6) has already been considered.
22. Edge (9, 3) has already been considered.
23. Edge (9, 5) has already been considered.
24. Edge (9, 6) has already been considered.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
