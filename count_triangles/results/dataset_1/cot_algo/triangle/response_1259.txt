Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections and relabelling the nodes accordingly. The sorted list of nodes with their degrees is as follows:
(2: 1), (4: 1), (7: 1), (3: 2), (6: 2), (0: 3), (1: 4), (9: 4), (5: 5), (8: 5).

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between the two vertices of each edge. 

The total number of triangles is [5].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 0, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.
