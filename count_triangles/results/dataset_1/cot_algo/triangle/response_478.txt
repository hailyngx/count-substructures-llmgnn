Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we have the following ordering:  

Vertices: 6, 1, 3, 8, 5, 7, 2, 4, 9, 0

Using the degree-based ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:

1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 4, 2>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
