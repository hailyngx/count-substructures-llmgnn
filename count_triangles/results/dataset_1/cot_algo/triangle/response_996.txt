Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following order: 

Node 1: 1 connection
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>
