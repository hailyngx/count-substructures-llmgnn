Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 3: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 2
Nodes 0, 9: Degree 3
Nodes 2, 8: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 7: Degree 7

Now, we will identify the triangles formed by the edges. We will only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

From the given edges:
1. Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with node 1.
2. Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with no other node.
3. Edge (0, 7) forms triangles with nodes 1 and 2.
4. Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with no other node.
5. Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with node 2.
6. Edge (2, 1) forms triangles with nodes 0 and 4.
7. Edge (3, 7) forms triangles with nodes 0 and 2.
8. Edge (4, 1) forms a triangle with no other node.
9. Edge (5, 8) forms a triangle with no other node.
10. Edge (7, 0) forms triangles with nodes 1 and 4.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 7, 2>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 0>, <2, 0, 4>.
