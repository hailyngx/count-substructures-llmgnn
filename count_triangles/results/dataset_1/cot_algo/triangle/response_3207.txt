Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:
- Node 5 has 2 connections.
- Nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 1 and 2 have 4 connections each.
- Nodes 3 and 7 have 5 connections each.
- Node 4 has 6 connections.
- Relabel the vertices accordingly:  
      Node 5 (2 connections) -> Vertex 1  
      Nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9 (3 connections) -> Vertices 2, 3, 4, 5  
      Nodes 1 and 2 (4 connections) -> Vertices 6, 7  
      Nodes 3 and 7 (5 connections) -> Vertices 8, 9  
      Node 4 (6 connections) -> Vertex 10  
- Check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method and the given edges:  
      1. (0, 4): No triangle  
      2. (0, 6): No triangle  
      3. (1, 3): No triangle  
      4. (1, 6): No triangle  
      5. (1, 8): Triangle <1, 6, 8>  
      6. (1, 9): No triangle  
      7. (2, 4): Triangle <2, 4, 10>  
      8. (2, 7): No triangle  
      9. (2, 8): Triangle <2, 7, 10>  
      10. (3, 1): No triangle  
      11. (3, 8): Triangle <1, 3, 8>  
      12. (3, 9): No triangle  
      13. (4, 0): No triangle  
      14. (4, 2): Triangle <2, 4, 10>  
      15. (4, 7): Triangle <2, 4, 10>  
      16. (5, 8): No triangle  
      17. (5, 9): No triangle  
      18. (6, 0): No triangle  
      19. (6, 1): No triangle  
      20. (6, 7): Triangle <2, 6, 10>  
      21. (7, 2): No triangle  
      22. (7, 4): Triangle <2, 4, 10>  
      23. (7, 6): Triangle <2, 6, 10>  
      24. (8, 1): Triangle <1, 6, 8>  
      25. (8, 2): Triangle <2, 7, 10>  
      26. (8, 3): Triangle <1, 3, 8>  
      27. (8, 5): No triangle  
      28. (9, 1): No triangle  
      29. (9, 3): No triangle  
      30. (9, 5): No triangle  
- Total number of triangles: [7]  
- Unique triangles found: <1, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 10>, <2, 6, 10>, <2, 7, 10>, <1, 3, 8>
