Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices in increasing order of degree:
0: 3 connections
1: 1 connection
3: 1 connection
6: 2 connections
8: 1 connection
9: 2 connections
2: 4 connections
5: 3 connections
7: 2 connections
4: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees starting from 0:
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
3 -> 2
6 -> 3
8 -> 4
9 -> 5
2 -> 6
5 -> 7
7 -> 8
4 -> 9

Based on the connections and relabeled vertices, we can find the triangles:
Triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
