Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
    - Node 2 (degree 1)
    - Node 9 (degree 1)
    - Node 1 (degree 2)
    - Node 5 (degree 2)
    - Node 0 (degree 3)
    - Node 3 (degree 3)
    - Node 6 (degree 3)
    - Node 7 (degree 4)
    - Node 8 (degree 5)
    - Node 4 (degree 6)

Now, we will count the number of triangles by considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 7, 4>
- <4, 7, 6>
- <7, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [7]
