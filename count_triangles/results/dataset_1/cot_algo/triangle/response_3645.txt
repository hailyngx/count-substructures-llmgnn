Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:
- Node 5: 0 connections
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections

Next, we examine the edges based on the relabeled vertices. For each edge, we consider only the cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 2): Nodes 0 and 2 share Node 4, forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 4): No applicable triangle.
3. Edge (0, 8): No applicable triangle.
4. Edge (1, 4): No applicable triangle.
5. Edge (2, 0): No applicable triangle.
6. Edge (2, 3): No applicable triangle.
7. Edge (3, 2): No applicable triangle.
8. Edge (3, 8): Nodes 3 and 8 share Node 9, forming triangle <3, 8, 9>.
9. Edge (4, 0): No applicable triangle.
10. Edge (4, 1): No applicable triangle.
11. Edge (6, 9): No applicable triangle.
12. Edge (8, 0): No applicable triangle.
13. Edge (8, 3): No applicable triangle.
14. Edge (8, 9): No applicable triangle.
15. Edge (9, 6): No applicable triangle.
16. Edge (9, 8): No applicable triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] with unique triangles being <0, 2, 4> and <3, 8, 9>.
