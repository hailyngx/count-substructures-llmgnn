Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9
Degrees: 2 1 1 3 4 1 4 1 4

Sorted Nodes: 1 2 5 7 0 9 6 3 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes:
1 -> 0
2 -> 1
5 -> 2
7 -> 3
0 -> 4
9 -> 5
6 -> 6
3 -> 7
4 -> 8

Now, let's consider each edge and count the triangles:
(1, 6): No triangle
(2, 7): No triangle
(5, 4): No triangle
(7, 3): No triangle
(0, 4): No triangle
(5, 9): No triangle
(6, 6): No triangle
(7, 7): No triangle
(0, 9): No triangle
(7, 4): No triangle
(4, 9): No triangle
(9, 6): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [0]
