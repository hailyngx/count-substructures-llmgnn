Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 8 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8 have 1 connection each.
- Nodes 3, 4, and 7 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 2 and 9 have 4 connections each.
- Nodes 5 has 3 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 2, 3>
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle <2, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
