Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we have the following numbering:  
Node 0 has degree 2  
Node 1 has degree 2  
Node 2 has degree 1  
Node 3 has degree 4  
Node 4 has degree 2  
Node 5 has degree 4  
Node 6 has degree 1  
Node 7 has degree 2  
Node 8 has degree 5  
Node 9 has degree 4  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:  
- Edge (0, 3): Shared connection with node 5  
- Edge (0, 8): No triangle formed  
- Edge (1, 3): No triangle formed  
- Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed  
- Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed  
- Edge (3, 0): Shared connection with node 5  
- Edge (3, 1): Shared connection with node 5  
- Edge (3, 5): Triangle formed with node 0  
- Edge (4, 7): No triangle formed  
- Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed  
- Edge (5, 2): No triangle formed  
- Edge (5, 3): Triangle formed with node 0  
- Edge (5, 8): Triangle formed with node 0  
- Edge (5, 9): Triangle formed with node 3  
- Edge (6, 1): No triangle formed  
- Edge (7, 4): No triangle formed  
- Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed  
- Edge (8, 0): No triangle formed  
- Edge (8, 4): No triangle formed  
- Edge (8, 5): Triangle formed with node 0  
- Edge (8, 9): Triangle formed with node 3  
- Edge (9, 5): Triangle formed with node 0  
- Edge (9, 7): No triangle formed  
- Edge (9, 8): Triangle formed with node 3  

The total number of triangles is [7]  
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <0, 8, 9>.
