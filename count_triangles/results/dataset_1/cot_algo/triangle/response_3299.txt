Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 9 with 1 connection
- Vertex 2 with 1 connection
- Vertex 5 with 2 connections
- Vertex 8 with 2 connections 
- Vertex 4 with 3 connections
- Vertex 1 with 3 connections
- Vertex 3 with 4 connections
- Vertex 7 with 4 connections
- Vertex 0 with 4 connections
- Vertex 6 with 5 connections

Now, we will check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Checking edge (0, 1): Both vertices have the same number of connections, so skip.
- Checking edge (0, 3): Vertex 3 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with vertex 0, 7, and 6.
- Checking edge (0, 7): Move on as vertex 7 has fewer connections.
- Checking edge (0, 9): Vertex 9 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with vertex 0, 1, and 3.
- Checking edge (1, 4): Both vertices have the same number of connections, so skip.
- Checking edge (1, 8): Move on as vertex 8 has fewer connections.
- Checking edge (2, 7): Both vertices have the same number of connections, so skip.
- Checking edge (3, 5): Both vertices have the same number of connections, so skip.
- Checking edge (3, 6): Vertex 6 has more connections, so skip.
- Checking edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with vertex 1, 8, and 4.
- Checking edge (6, 5): Vertex 5 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with vertex 2, 7, and 6.
- Checking edge (6, 7): Move on as vertex 7 has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 7, 6>, <0, 1, 3>, and <2, 7, 6>.
