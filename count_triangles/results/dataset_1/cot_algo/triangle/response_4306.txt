Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Then, vertices are relabeled accordingly from least connected to most connected. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their corresponding labels based on the number of connections:
0: 3 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
8: 1 connection
9: 2 connections
1: 5 connections
2: 6 connections
7: 6 connections

Now, we will check for triangles by examining each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will count the triangles and list them.

Number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
