Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, we have the following labels:

Node 4 (Degree 1)
Node 8 (Degree 1)
Node 9 (Degree 2)
Node 3 (Degree 3)
Node 7 (Degree 3)
Node 5 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 5)
Node 1 (Degree 5)
Node 2 (Degree 5)
Node 6 (Degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the provided graph, we can find the triangles:

1. For the edge (0, 1):
   Shared connections: 2
   Triangle: <0, 1, 2>

   Shared connections: 1
   Triangle: <0, 2, 5>

3. For the edge (0, 5):
   Shared connections: 2
   Triangle: <0, 2, 5>

4. For the edge (0, 6):
   Shared connections: 3
   Triangle: <0, 1, 6> 

5. For the edge (1, 2):
   Shared connections: 1
