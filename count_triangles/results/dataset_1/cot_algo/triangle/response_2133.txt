Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order, the new labeling is as follows: 
Node 5 has 0 connection(s).
Node 7 has 1 connection(s).
Node 3 has 2 connection(s).
Node 8 has 2 connection(s).
Node 2 has 3 connection(s).
Node 9 has 3 connection(s).
Node 5 has 4 connection(s).
Node 1 has 4 connection(s).
Node 6 has 5 connection(s).
Node 4 has 6 connection(s).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found in the graph are:
[6] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <4, 1, 6>.
