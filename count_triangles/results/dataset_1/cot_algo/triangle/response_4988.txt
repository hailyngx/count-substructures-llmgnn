Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 1 connection.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now analyze the edges and count the number of triangles formed:

1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 share a connection with Node 7, forming a triangle <0, 2, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 6): Node 0 and Node 6 do not form a triangle.
3. Edge (0, 7): Node 0 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.
5. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 and Node 5 do not form a triangle.
6. Edge (1, 8): Node 1 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.
7. Edge (2, 0): Node 0 and Node 2 share a connection with Node 7, forming a triangle <0, 2, 7>.
8. Edge (2, 3): Node 2 and Node 3 do not form a triangle.
9. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.
10. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.
11. Edge (3, 2): Node 2 and Node 3 do not form a triangle.
12. Edge (3, 5): Node 3 and Node 5 do not form a triangle.
13. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 and Node 6 do not form a triangle.
14. Edge (4, 1): Node 1 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.
15. Edge (4, 2): Node 2 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.
16. Edge (4, 9): Node 4 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.
17. Edge (5, 1): Node 1 and Node 5 do not form a triangle.
18. Edge (5, 3): Node 3 and Node 5 do not form a triangle.
19. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 and Node 6 share a connection with Node 7, forming a triangle <5, 6, 7>.
20. Edge (5, 7): Node 5 and Node 7 share a connection with Node 6, forming a triangle <5, 7, 6>.
21. Edge (6, 0): Node 0 and Node 6 do not form a triangle.
22. Edge (6, 3): Node 3 and Node 6 do not form a triangle.
23. Edge (6, 5): Node 5 and Node 6 share a connection with Node 7, forming a triangle <5, 6, 7>.
24. Edge (7, 0): Node 0 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.
25. Edge (7, 2): Node 2 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.
26. Edge (7, 5): Node 5 and Node 7 share a connection with Node 6, forming a triangle <5, 7, 6>.
27. Edge (7, 8): Node 7 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.
28. Edge (8, 1): Node 1 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.
29. Edge (8, 7): Node 7 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.
30. Edge (9, 4): Node 4 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 3, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, and <5, 7, 6>. 
The answer is [3].
