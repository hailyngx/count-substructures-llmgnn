Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most connections, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows: 

Vertices: 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 8 -> 7 -> 0 -> 3 -> 9 -> 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3): Vertices 0 and 3 have connections with vertices 4 and 9. 
   - Triangle (0, 3, 4) <0, 3, 4> 

2. Edge (0, 4): Vertices 0 and 4 have connections with vertices 3 and 7. 
   - No new triangle formed.

3. Edge (1, 6): Vertices 1 and 6 do not share any connections.
   - No new triangle formed.

4. Edge (3, 0): Skipped because vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 3.

5. Edge (3, 9): Vertices 3 and 9 have connections with vertices 0 and 5. 
   - Triangle (3, 0, 9) <3, 0, 9>

6. Edge (4, 0): Skipped because vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 4.

7. Edge (4, 7): Vertices 4 and 7 have connections with vertices 0 and 8.
   - No new triangle formed.

8. Edge (5, 9): Vertices 5 and 9 do not share any connections.
   - No new triangle formed.

9. Edge (6, 1): Skipped because vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 6.

10. Edge (7, 4): Skipped because vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 7.

11. Edge (7, 8): Vertices 7 and 8 have connections with vertex 4. 
   - No new triangle formed.

12. Edge (8, 7): Skipped because vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 8.

13. Edge (9, 3): Skipped because vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 9.

14. Edge (9, 5): Vertices 9 and 5 do not share any connections.
   - No new triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4> and <3, 0, 9>.
