Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we relabel them as follows:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 1
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 1
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
