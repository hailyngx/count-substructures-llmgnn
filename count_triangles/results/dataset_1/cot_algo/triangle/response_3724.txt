Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 1: 0 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Following the method, we consider the edges in the following order: 
(1) (6, 5)
(2) (6, 5), (4, 3)
(3) (6, 5), (4, 3), (4, 3)
(4) (6, 5), (4, 3), (4, 3), (9, 7)
(5) (6, 5), (4, 3), (8, 7), (4, 3), (9, 7)
(6) (6, 5), (8, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 7), (5, 3)

This results in a total of [6] triangles. Here are the unique triangles found: 
<6, 5, 3>
<8, 7, 9>
<8, 7, 3>
<9, 7, 3>
<4, 3, 5>
<4, 3, 5>
