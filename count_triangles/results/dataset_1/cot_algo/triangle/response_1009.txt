Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes with degrees:
0: 2
1: 4
3: 2
4: 2
5: 3
6: 2
7: 4
8: 4
9: 2

Sorted nodes:
0, 3, 4, 6, 9, 5, 8, 1, 7

Now, we will count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 7, 6>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 9, 1>
<3, 9, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [10]
