Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  
Vertex 1 (degree 0): 1  
Vertex 4 (degree 1): 2  
Vertex 2 (degree 2): 3  
Vertex 7 (degree 2): 4  
Vertex 8 (degree 2): 5  
Vertex 3 (degree 3): 6  
Vertex 5 (degree 4): 7  
Vertex 6 (degree 5): 8  
Vertex 9 (degree 5): 9  
Vertex 0 (degree 6): 10  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles in the graph.
The total number of triangles is [11].
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 6, 9>  
<0, 7, 9>  
<2, 4, 5>  
<2, 5, 8>  
<2, 5, 7>  
<5, 6, 7>
