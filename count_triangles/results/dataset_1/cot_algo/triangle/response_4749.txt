Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degrees in non-decreasing order, the new labels for the nodes will be: 

Node 1 (degree 2) - connections: 1, 5  
Node 0 (degree 3) - connections: 4, 8, 9  
Node 5 (degree 2) - connections: 2, 6  
Node 6 (degree 4) - connections: 3, 5, 7, 9  
Node 7 (degree 3) - connections: 8, 9  
Node 2 (degree 3) - connections: 5, 8  
Node 8 (degree 4) - connections: 0, 1, 2, 7  
Node 3 (degree 4) - connections: 1, 4, 6, 9  
Node 4 (degree 3) - connections: 0, 3, 9  
Node 9 (degree 5) - connections: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

Node 1 (1, 5): No triangle can be formed with node 1 due to its low degree.  
Node 0 (4, 8, 9):  
- (0, 4) shares nodes 3 and 9 -> Triangle <0, 4, 9>  
- (0, 8) shares nodes 1 and 2 -> Triangle <0, 8, 1>  
Node 5 (2, 6):  
- (5, 2) shares node 8 -> Triangle <5, 2, 8>  
- (5, 6) shares node 3 -> Triangle <5, 6, 3>  
Node 6 (3, 5, 7, 9):  
- (6, 3) shares nodes 1 and 9 -> Triangle <6, 3, 9>  
- (6, 5) shares node 2 -> Triangle <6, 5, 2>  
- (6, 7) shares nodes 8 and 9 -> Triangle <6, 7, 9>  
Node 7 (8, 9):  
- (7, 9) shares nodes 6, 4 -> Triangle <7, 9, 6>  
Node 2 (5, 8):  
- (2, 5) shares nodes 6 -> Triangle <2, 5, 6>  
- (2, 8) shares nodes 0, 1 -> Triangle <2, 8, 0>  
Node 8 (0, 1, 2, 7):  
- (8, 0) shares nodes 4, 9 -> Triangle <8, 0, 4>  
- (8, 1) shares nodes 3, 2 -> Triangle <8, 1, 3>  
- (8, 2) shares nodes 5, 6 -> Triangle <8, 2, 5>  
- (8, 7) shares node 9 -> Triangle <8, 7, 9>  
Node 3 (1, 4, 6, 9):  
- (3, 1) shares node 8 -> Triangle <3, 1, 8>  
- (3, 4) shares nodes 0, 9 -> Triangle <3, 4, 9>  
- (3, 6) shares nodes 5, 9 -> Triangle <3, 6, 5>  
- (3, 9) shares nodes 0, 4 -> Triangle <3, 9, 4>  
Node 4 (0, 3, 9):  
- (4, 0) shares nodes 8, 3 -> Triangle <4, 0, 8>  
Node 9 (0, 3, 4, 6, 7):  
- (9, 0) shares nodes 3, 4 -> Triangle <9, 0, 3>  
- (9, 3) shares nodes 6, 4 -> Triangle <9, 3, 6>  
- (9, 4) shares nodes 3, 0 -> Triangle <9, 4, 0>  
- (9, 6) shares nodes 3, 7 -> Triangle <9, 6, 3>  
- (9, 7) shares nodes 6, 8 -> Triangle <9, 7, 6>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [14].
