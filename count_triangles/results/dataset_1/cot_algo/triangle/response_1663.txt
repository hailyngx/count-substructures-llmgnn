Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections. Then we will relabel the vertices accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is as follows:
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 0 connections
Vertex 10: 0 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangle 1: <4, 8, 5>
Triangle 2: <4, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
