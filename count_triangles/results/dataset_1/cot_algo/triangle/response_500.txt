Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, the vertices are relabeled accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels are:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 6

Now, we will check each edge based on the new labels:
- Edge (4, 2) is not considered because node 1 has a higher degree than node 2.
- Edge (1, 6) is not considered because node 1 has a higher degree than node 6.
- Edge (6, 5) is not considered because node 5 has a higher degree than node 6.
- Edge (0, 9): Shared connections: 3. Triangle: <0, 3, 9>
- Edge (5, 7): Shared connections: 1. Triangle: <5, 7, 1>
- Edge (6, 1): Shared connections: 7. Triangle: <6, 1, 7>
- Edge (5, 9): Shared connections: 0. Triangle: <5, 9, 0>
- Edge (1, 7): Shared connections: 6. Triangle: <1, 7, 3>
- Edge (5, 6): Shared connections: 5. Triangle: <5, 6, 1>
- Edge (7, 1): Shared connections: 8. Triangle: <7, 1, 8>
- Edge (2, 7): Shared connections: 2. Triangle: <2, 7, 3>
- Edge (3, 7): Shared connections: 2. Triangle: <3, 7, 2>
- Edge (2, 8): Shared connections: 1. Triangle: <2, 8, 1>
- Edge (7, 5): Shared connections: 6. Triangle: <7, 5, 6>
- Edge (3, 2): Shared connections: 0. Triangle: <3, 2, 9>
- Edge (9, 0): Shared connections: 2. Triangle: <9, 0, 3>
- Edge (0, 3): Shared connections: 9. Triangle: <0, 3, 2>
- Edge (2, 4): Shared connections: 2. Triangle: <2, 4, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15] and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 9>, <5, 7, 1>, <6, 1, 7>, <5, 9, 0>, <1, 7, 3>, <5, 6, 1>, <7, 1, 8>, <2, 7, 3>, <3, 7, 2>, <2, 8, 1>, <7, 5, 6>, <3, 2, 9>, <9, 0, 3>, <0, 3, 2>, <2, 4, 3>.
