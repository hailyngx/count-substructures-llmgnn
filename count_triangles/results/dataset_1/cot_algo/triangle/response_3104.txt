Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices by number of connections:
1. 9 (degree 2)
2. 1 (degree 2)
3. 6 (degree 3)
4. 0 (degree 3)
5. 7 (degree 4)
6. 5 (degree 5)
7. 4 (degree 5)
8. 8 (degree 5)
9. 3 (degree 6)
10. 2 (degree 7)

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method and count the triangles:

1. For vertex 9 (degree 2):
   - No triangles as it has fewer connections than its neighboring vertices.

2. For vertex 1 (degree 2):
   - No triangles as it has fewer connections than its neighboring vertices.

3. For vertex 6 (degree 3):
   - No triangles as it has fewer connections than its neighboring vertices.

4. For vertex 0 (degree 3):
   - No triangles as it has fewer connections than its neighboring vertices.

5. For vertex 7 (degree 4):
   - No triangles as it has fewer connections than its neighboring vertices.

6. For vertex 5 (degree 5):
   - Triangle <0, 4, 5>

7. For vertex 4 (degree 5):
   - Triangle <0, 4, 5>
   - Triangle <0, 4, 6>

8. For vertex 8 (degree 5):
   - Triangle <0, 4, 8>
   - Triangle <0, 5, 8>
   - Triangle <4, 5, 8>

9. For vertex 3 (degree 6):
   - Triangle <2, 3, 5>
   - Triangle <2, 3, 7>
   - Triangle <2, 3, 8>

10. For vertex 2 (degree 7):
   - Triangle <2, 3, 5>
   - Triangle <2, 3, 7>
   - Triangle <2, 3, 8>

Total number of triangles: [9]
