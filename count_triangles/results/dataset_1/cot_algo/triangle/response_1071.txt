Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 8: 0 (degree 3)
Node 1: 4 (degree 3)
Node 7: 6 (degree 4)
Node 9: 9 (degree 4)
Node 3: 1 (degree 5)
Node 6: 5 (degree 5)
Node 4: 2 (degree 6)
Node 2: 7 (degree 6)
Node 5: 8 (degree 7)
Node 0: 3 (degree 7)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (0, 3): Shared connections with node 5 => Triangle <0, 3, 5>
2. (1, 2): Shared connections with nodes 5 and 7 => Triangles <1, 2, 5> and <1, 2, 7>
3. (1, 5): Shared connection with node 2 => Triangle <1, 2, 5>
4. (1, 7): Shared connection with node 2 => Triangle <1, 2, 7>
5. (2, 3): Shared connections with nodes 0 and 5 => Triangles <0, 2, 3> and <2, 3, 5>
6. (2, 5): Shared connections with nodes 1, 3, and 7 => Triangles <1, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, and <2, 5, 7>
7. (2, 6): No triangles formed.
8. (2, 7): Shared connection with node 1 => Triangle <1, 2, 7>
9. (3, 5): Shared connections with nodes 0 and 2 => Triangles <0, 2, 3> and <2, 3, 5>
10. (4, 6): Shared connection with node 7 => Triangle <4, 6, 7>
11. (4, 7): Shared connections with nodes 1 and 6 => Triangle <1, 4, 7> and <4, 6, 7>
12. (4, 9): No triangles formed.
13. (5, 6): Shared connection with node 2 => Triangle <2, 5, 6>
14. (6, 7): Shared connection with nodes 4 and 2 => Triangle <4, 6, 7> and <6, 7, 2>
15. (7, 9): Shared connection with node 4 => Triangle <4, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [17]
