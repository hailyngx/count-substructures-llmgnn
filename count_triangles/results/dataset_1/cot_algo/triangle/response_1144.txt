Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections. The sorted order is: 3, 5, 6, 1, 0, 8, 4, 9, 7, 2. 

Applying this ordering, we can count the triangles in the graph. 

The triangles found are: 
<2, 4, 0>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 1, 0>
<4, 9, 7>
<9, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
