Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling would be:  
Node 2 → Degree 1  
Node 4 → Degree 0  
Node 7 → Degree 1  
Node 9 → Degree 1  
Node 0 → Degree 3  
Node 1 → Degree 4  
Node 8 → Degree 4  
Node 5 → Degree 5  
Node 6 → Degree 4  
Node 3 → Degree 4  

Now, we will check for triangles starting with edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:  

1. Edge between nodes 2 and 3: No triangles  
2. Edge between nodes 4 and 7: No triangles  
3. Edge between nodes 2 and 4: No triangles  
4. Edge between nodes 7 and 9: No triangles  
5. Edge between nodes 0 and 1: Triangle <0, 1, 5>  
6. Edge between nodes 0 and 8: No triangles  
7. Edge between nodes 1 and 5: Triangle <0, 1, 5>  
8. Edge between nodes 3  and 9: No triangles  
9. Edge between nodes 0 and 5: Triangle <0, 1, 5>  
10. Edge between nodes 0 and 8: No triangles  
11. Edge between nodes 1 and 6: No triangles  
12. Edge between nodes 5 and 6: Triangle <0, 1, 5>  
13. Edge between nodes 5 and 8: No triangles  
14. Edge between nodes 5 and 7: No triangles  
15. Edge between nodes 5 and 6: Triangle <0, 1, 5>  
16. Edge between nodes 5 and 8: No triangles  
17. Edge between nodes 6 and 1: No triangles  
18. Edge between nodes 6 and 3: No triangles  
19. Edge between nodes 6 and 5: Triangle <0, 1, 5>  
20. Edge between nodes 6 and 8: No triangles  
21. Edge between nodes 7 and 5: No triangles  
22. Edge between nodes 8 and 0: No triangles  
23. Edge between nodes 8 and 5: No triangles  
24. Edge between nodes 8 and 6: No triangles  
25. Edge between nodes 9 and 3: No triangles  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 5>.
