Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding degrees are:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 5
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 2

Sorting the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes in order: 0, 1, 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 8, 2

Calculating the number of triangles with the Degree-Based Ordering method:
For the edges (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 6):
- No triangles formed from these edges.

For the edges (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 5):
- No triangles formed from these edges.

For the edges (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 9):
- No triangles formed from these edges.

For the edges (4, 3), (4, 7), (5, 3), (5, 9):
- No triangles formed from these edges.

For the edges (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 7):
- Triangles <0, 2, 6>, <2, 3, 6> found.

For the edges (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8):
- No triangles formed from these edges.

For the edges (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 7):
- No triangles formed from these edges.

For the edges (9, 2), (9, 5):
- No triangles formed from these edges.

The total number of triangles found is: [2]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 6>
