Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 1
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 2
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 4

Now, we'll relabel the nodes based on their degrees (from least to most connections):
- Node 3: 0
- Nodes 6 and 7: 1
- Nodes 1, 2, and 5: 2
- Node 0 and 4: 3
- Node 8: 4

The edges to consider are:
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 6), (1, 8), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 0), (7, 2), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles:  
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
