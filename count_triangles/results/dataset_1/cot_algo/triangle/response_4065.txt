Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees from least to most are:
Vertices: 3, 4, 6, 8, 5, 9, 7, 2, 1, 0

After relabeling, the edges to consider are:
(3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 8)

Calculating the triangles formed:
<3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
