Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, and then relabeling them accordingly. In this case, the sorted list of vertices based on their connections is as follows: 

Vertices: 3, 7, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 4, 8, 0 

Using this sorting, we can analyze the edges and count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 

<0, 1, 3> 
<0, 4, 6> 
<0, 5, 2> 
<0, 8, 9> 
<3, 1, 8> 
<4, 6, 2>
