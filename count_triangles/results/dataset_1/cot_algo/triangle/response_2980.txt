Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 - Degree 4
Node 1 - Degree 2
Node 6 - Degree 2
Node 8 - Degree 1
Node 4 - Degree 3
Node 9 - Degree 2
Node 7 - Degree 4
Node 5 - Degree 5
Node 2 - Degree 4
Node 3 - Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and examining the edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<5, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
