Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 7 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 4, 6, and 5 each have 2 connections.
- Nodes 3 and 9 each have 3 connections.
- Nodes 0, 1, and 8 each have 5 connections.
- Node 2 has 6 connections.

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 8, 2>
4. <0, 8, 3>
5. <0, 8, 9>
6. <1, 0, 5>
7. <1, 0, 8>
8. <1, 8, 2>
9. <1, 8, 3>
10. <1, 8, 9>
11. <2, 0, 8>
12. <2, 2, 8> (Node 2 connecting to itself)
13. <2, 3, 8>
14. <2, 8, 9>
15. <5, 1, 8>
16. <5, 2, 8>
17. <8, 0, 3>
18. <8, 0, 9>
19. <8, 1, 3>
20. <8, 1, 9>
21. <8, 2, 3>
22. <8, 2, 9>
23. <8, 3, 9>
24. <8, 9, 2>
25. <8, 9, 2> (Node 9 connecting to itself)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [25].
