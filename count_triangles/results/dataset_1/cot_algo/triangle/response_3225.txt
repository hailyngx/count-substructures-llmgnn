Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertex 3 < Vertex 5 < Vertex 0 < Vertex 8 < Vertex 7 < Vertex 1 < Vertex 6 < Vertex 9 < Vertex 4 < Vertex 2

Now, let's go through the edges according to the degree-based ordering:

1. Edge (3, 8): Both vertices have fewer connections than the other vertex in the edge, so we proceed.
2. Edge (5, 9): Both vertices have fewer connections than the other vertex in the edge, so we proceed.
3. Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than Vertex 4, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 0 and Vertex 4: Vertex 7
    - Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>
4. Edge (7, 0): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than Vertex 7, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 7 and Vertex 0: Vertex 1
    - Triangle formed: <0, 7, 1>
5. Edge (8, 4): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than Vertex 8, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 8 and Vertex 4: Vertex 3
    - Triangle formed: <8, 4, 3>
6. Edge (7, 1): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than Vertex 7, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 7 and Vertex 1: Vertex 9
    - Triangle formed: <7, 1, 9>
7. Edge (4, 8): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than Vertex 8, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 8 and Vertex 4: Vertex 3
    - Triangle formed: <4, 8, 3>
8. Edge (6, 1): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than Vertex 6, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 6 and Vertex 1: Vertex 4
    - Triangle formed: <6, 1, 4>
9. Edge (9, 5): Vertex 5 has fewer connections than Vertex 9, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 9 and Vertex 5: None
10. Edge (4, 1): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than Vertex 4, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 4 and Vertex 1: Vertex 6
    - Triangle formed: <4, 1, 6>
11. Edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than Vertex 6, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 6 and Vertex 4: Vertex 1
    - Triangle formed: <6, 4, 1>
12. Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than Vertex 7, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 1 and Vertex 7: Vertex 4
    - Triangle formed: <1, 7, 4>
13. Edge (9, 7): Vertex 7 has fewer connections than Vertex 9, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 9 and Vertex 7: Vertex 4
    - Triangle formed: <9, 7, 4>
14. Edge (9, 6): Vertex 6 has fewer connections than Vertex 9, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 9 and Vertex 6: Vertex 4
    - Triangle formed: <9, 6, 4>
15. Edge (6, 4): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than Vertex 6, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 6 and Vertex 4: Vertex 1
    - Triangle formed: <6, 4, 1>
16. Edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than Vertex 7, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 0 and Vertex 7: Vertex 4
    - Triangle formed: <0, 7, 4>
17. Edge (9, 4): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than Vertex 9, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 9 and Vertex 4: Vertex 6
    - Triangle formed: <9, 4, 6>
18. Edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than Vertex 4, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between Vertex 1 and Vertex 4: Vertex 6
    - Triangle formed: <1, 4, 6>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
