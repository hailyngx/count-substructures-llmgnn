Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each node:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 9: 4 connections

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their number of connections (from least to most connections):
- Node 0: 0 connections
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:
- For edge (0, 1): No triangles formed.
- For edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.
- For edge (2, 4): Triangle <2, 4, 6> found.
- For edge (2, 7): No triangles formed.
- For edge (2, 9): Triangle <2, 4, 9> found.
- For edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.
- For edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
- For edge (4, 6): No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 9): Triangle <2, 7, 9> found.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <2, 4, 6>, <2, 7, 9>
