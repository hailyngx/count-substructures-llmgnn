Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees, the new ordering is: 

Node 3: 0 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 9. Therefore, triangle <0, 2, 8> is found.
2. Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 4. Therefore, triangle <0, 9, 8> is found.
3. Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 4. Therefore, triangle <0, 8, 2> is found.
4. Edge (1, 5) forms no triangle.
5. Edge (1, 7) forms no triangle.
6. Edge (2, 4) forms no triangle.
7. Edge (2, 6) forms no triangle.
8. Edge (3, 4) forms no triangle.
9. Edge (3, 8) forms no triangle.
10. Edge (4, 8) forms no triangle.
11. Edge (4, 9) forms no triangle.
12. Edge (5, 8) forms no triangle.
13. Edge (7, 9) forms no triangle.

Total number of triangles: [3]

Hence, the unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 9, 8>, <0, 8, 2>.
