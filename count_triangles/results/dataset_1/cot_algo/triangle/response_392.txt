Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 1
- Vertex 3: degree 5
- Vertex 4: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 3
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0 (degree 3) -> Vertex A
- Vertex 1 (degree 3) -> Vertex B
- Vertex 2 (degree 1) -> Vertex C
- Vertex 3 (degree 5) -> Vertex D
- Vertex 4 (degree 4) -> Vertex E
- Vertex 5 (degree 3) -> Vertex F
- Vertex 6 (degree 3) -> Vertex G
- Vertex 7 (degree 1) -> Vertex H
- Vertex 8 (degree 2) -> Vertex I
- Vertex 9 (degree 2) -> Vertex J

Now, let's list the edges based on the new labels:
- (A, D) (A, E) (A, G)
- (B, D) (B, G) (B, H)
- (C, D)
- (D, A) (D, B) (D, C) (D, E)
- (E, A) (E, D) (E, F) (E, G)
- (F, E) (F, I) (F, J)
- (G, A) (G, B) (G, E)
- (H, B)
- (I, F) (I, J)
- (J, F) (J, I)

Now, let's count the triangles by following the degree-based ordering method:
- Triangle 1: <A, D, E>
- Triangle 2: <D, E, G>
- Triangle 3: <B, D, G>
- Triangle 4: <F, I, J>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
