Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their degree are: 3, 5, 9, 4, 8, 1, 2, 7, 6.

Using this ordering, we will count the triangles:

1. Edge (1, 6) cannot form a triangle.
2. Edge (1, 9) cannot form a triangle.
3. Edge (2, 4) cannot form a triangle.
4. Edge (2, 6) can form a triangle with vertex 8: <2, 6, 8>.
5. Edge (2, 8) can form a triangle with vertex 6: <2, 6, 8>.
6. Edge (4, 2) cannot form a triangle.
7. Edge (5, 7) cannot form a triangle.
8. Edge (6, 1) cannot form a triangle.
9. Edge (6, 2) can form a triangle with vertex 8: <2, 6, 8>.
10. Edge (6, 7) can form a triangle with vertex 5: <5, 6, 7>.
11. Edge (6, 8) can form a triangle with vertex 2: <2, 6, 8>.
12. Edge (7, 5) cannot form a triangle.
13. Edge (7, 6) can form a triangle with vertex 5: <5, 6, 7>.
14. Edge (7, 9) cannot form a triangle.
15. Edge (8, 2) can form a triangle with vertex 6: <2, 6, 8>.
16. Edge (8, 6) can form a triangle with vertex 2: <2, 6, 8>.
17. Edge (9, 1) cannot form a triangle.
18. Edge (9, 7) cannot form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5]. The unique triangles are <2, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>.
