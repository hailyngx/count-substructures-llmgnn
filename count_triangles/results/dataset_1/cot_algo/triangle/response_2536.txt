Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertices: 6, 1, 8, 5, 3, 0, 4, 7, 2, 9

Now, let's follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph:

Count of Triangles: [7]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
