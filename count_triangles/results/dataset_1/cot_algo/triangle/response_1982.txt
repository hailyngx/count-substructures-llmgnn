Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is: 
- Node 1: 1 connection 
- Node 6: 1 connection 
- Node 7: 1 connection 
- Node 2: 2 connections 
- Node 9: 2 connections 
- Node 5: 4 connections 
- Node 4: 4 connections 
- Node 3: 5 connections 
- Node 8: 5 connections 
- Node 0: 6 connections 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph.
The total number of triangles is: [9]

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<8, 7, 0>
<9, 6, 4>
<9, 6, 5>
