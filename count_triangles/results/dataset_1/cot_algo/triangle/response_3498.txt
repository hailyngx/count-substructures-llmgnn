Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connected:

Vertex 1: 4 connections 
Vertex 7: 4 connections 
Vertex 9: 4 connections 
Vertex 0: 3 connections 
Vertex 2: 3 connections 
Vertex 3: 3 connections 
Vertex 5: 3 connections 
Vertex 8: 3 connections 
Vertex 4: 4 connections 
Vertex 6: 4 connections 

Now we relabel the vertices: 

Vertex 0 (3 connections): A 
Vertex 2 (3 connections): B 
Vertex 3 (3 connections): C 
Vertex 5 (3 connections): D 
Vertex 8 (3 connections): E 
Vertex 1 (4 connections): F 
Vertex 7 (4 connections): G 
Vertex 9 (4 connections): H 
Vertex 4 (4 connections): I 
Vertex 6 (4 connections): J 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles, we observe the shared connections between vertices connected by an edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

Counting the triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
