Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method begins with sorting vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Relabeling the nodes based on the degree:

Node 8: 1
Node 0: 2
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 2
Node 4: 2
Node 6: 3
Node 3: 4
Node 7: 4
Node 9: 5
Node 5: 5

Considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 3): Shared connections with node 9, forming triangle <0, 3, 9>
- Edge (0, 9): Shared connections with node 3, forming triangle <0, 9, 3>
- Edge (1, 5): Shared connections with nodes 2 and 9, forming triangles <1, 5, 2> and <1, 5, 9>
- Edge (4, 5): Shared connections with nodes 1, 2, and 7, forming triangles <4, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 2>, and <4, 5, 7>
- Edge (6, 7): Shared connections with nodes 5 and 9, forming triangles <6, 7, 5> and <6, 7, 9>
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 7): No triangles formed

Total number of triangles: [6]
