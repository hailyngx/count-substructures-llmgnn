Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are:
Node 4: 1 connection
Nodes 0, 4: 2 connections
Nodes 1, 6, 7, 8: 4 connections
Nodes 2, 3, 5: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 5: <0, 2, 5>
- Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 7: <1, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
