Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections, the new labels will be as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges in the order specified in the input. We will count triangles for each edge if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Calculating the total number of triangles using the provided graph:
- Total triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
