Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 1 has 2 connections,
Node 7 has 1 connection,
Node 9 has 2 connections,
Node 5 has 4 connections,
Node 6 has 3 connections,
Node 4 has 3 connections,
Node 2 has 4 connections,
Node 8 has 4 connections,
Node 3 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we find the total number of triangles to be [4]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, and <3, 4, 8>.
