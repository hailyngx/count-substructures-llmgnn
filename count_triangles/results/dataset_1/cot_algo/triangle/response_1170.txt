Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling is as follows: 
Nodes: 3, 6, 8, 7, 2, 4, 1, 5, 9, 0.
