Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- The vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are: 3, 5, 6, 7, 1, 4, 9, 8, 0, 2.
- The graph with vertices relabeled accordingly is: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph:
- Going through the edges in order, we see that vertices 0 and 1 form a triangle with vertex 2: <0, 1, 2>.
- Vertex 0 forms a triangle with vertices 3 and 8: <0, 3, 8>.
- Vertex 1 forms a triangle with vertices 2 and 3: <1, 2, 3>.
- Vertex 2 forms triangles with vertices 4, 5, and 8: <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 9>.
- Vertex 9 forms a triangle with vertices 3 and 4: <3, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
