Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be sorted based on the number of connections each node has as follows:

Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 1 connection.
Nodes 5 and 6 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 9 and 5 have 2 connections each.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Nodes 4 and 8 have 4 connections each.
  
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles:

1. (0, 4) - shares connections with nodes 7 and 8 forming triangle <0, 7, 8>.
2. (0, 5) - no triangle formed.
3. (0, 6) - no triangle formed.
4. (0, 8) - shares connection with node 7 forming triangle <0, 7, 8>.
5. (1, 2) - no triangle formed.
6. (1, 7) - no triangle formed.
7. (2, 1) - no triangle formed.
8. (2, 3) - no triangle formed.
9. (4, 0) - shares connections with nodes 7 and 8 forming triangle <0, 7, 8>.
10. (4, 7) - shares connections with nodes 8 and 9 forming triangle <4, 8, 9>.
11. (4, 8) - shares connection with node 9 forming triangle <4, 8, 9>.
12. (4, 9) - no triangle formed.
13. (7, 1) - no triangle formed.
14. (7, 4) - shares connection with node 8 forming triangle <4, 7, 8>.
15. (7, 9) - no triangle formed.
16. (8, 0) - shares connection with node 7 forming triangle <0, 7, 8>.
17. (8, 4) - shares connection with node 9 forming triangle <4, 8, 9>.
18. (9, 4) - no triangle formed.
19. (9, 7) - no triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles:
<0, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
