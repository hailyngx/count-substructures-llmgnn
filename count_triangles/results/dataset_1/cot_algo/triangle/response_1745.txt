Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of their connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeling:
Nodes: 0(4), 1(3), 7(3), 2(4), 8(1), 4(4), 6(5), 9(3), 5(4), 3(4).

Now, we will count the number of triangles by examining each edge starting from the one with the lower label.

1. Edge (0, 1) - Node 0 and Node 1 have 3 shared connections: 3, 5, 7. 
2. Edge (0, 3) - Node 0 and Node 3 have 1 shared connection: 5. 
3. Edge (0, 5) - Node 0 and Node 5 have 1 shared connection: 7. 
4. Edge (0, 7) - Node 0 and Node 7 have 1 shared connection: 5.
5. Edge (1, 3) - Node 1 and Node 3 have 1 shared connection: 6.
6. Edge (1, 6) - Node 1 and Node 6 have 1 shared connection: 4.
7. Edge (7, 2) - Node 7 and Node 2 have 1 shared connection: 5.
8. Edge (8, 6) - Node 8 and Node 6 have no shared connections.
9. Edge (6, 3) - Node 6 and Node 3 have 1 shared connection: 4.
10. Edge (6, 4) - Node 6 and Node 4 have 1 shared connection: 5.
11. Edge (6, 7) - Node 6 and Node 7 have 1 shared connection: 5.
12. Edge (6, 9) - Node 6 and Node 9 have 1 shared connection: 5.

Total number of triangles found: [7]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <6, 4, 5>, <6, 7, 5>
