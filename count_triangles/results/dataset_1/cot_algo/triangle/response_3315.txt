Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 1: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Now that the vertices are relabeled according to their degrees, we can analyze the edges in ascending order:

1. Edge (1, 2): forms a triangle with shared connection 5 (resulting in triangle <1, 2, 5>).
2. Edge (1, 4): does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (4, 6): does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (0, 3): does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (0, 6): does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (0, 7): does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (0, 8): forms a triangle with shared connection 5 (resulting in triangle <0, 8, 5>).
8. Edge (1, 8): does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (2, 1): does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (2, 3): does not form a triangle.
11. Edge (2, 5): forms a triangle with shared connection 0 (resulting in triangle <2, 5, 0>).
12. Edge (2, 9): does not form a triangle.
13. Edge (3, 0): does not form a triangle.
14. Edge (3, 2): does not form a triangle.
15. Edge (3, 5): forms a triangle with shared connection 8 (resulting in triangle <3, 5, 8>).
16. Edge (3, 8): does not form a triangle.
17. Edge (5, 2): forms a triangle with shared connection 0 (resulting in triangle <5, 2, 0>).
18. Edge (5, 3): forms a triangle with shared connection 8 (resulting in triangle <5, 3, 8>).
19. Edge (5, 4): does not form a triangle.
20. Edge (5, 8): forms a triangle with shared connection 0 (resulting in triangle <5, 8, 0>).
21. Edge (6, 0): does not form a triangle.
22. Edge (6, 4): does not form a triangle.
23. Edge (7, 0): does not form a triangle.
24. Edge (7, 9): does not form a triangle.
25. Edge (8, 0): forms a triangle with shared connection 5 (resulting in triangle <8, 0, 5>).
26. Edge (8, 1): does not form a triangle.
27. Edge (8, 3): does not form a triangle.
28. Edge (8, 5): forms a triangle with shared connection 0 (resulting in triangle <8, 5, 0>).
29. Edge (9, 2): does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 5>, <0, 8, 5>, <2, 5, 0>, <3, 5, 8>, and <5, 8, 0>.
