Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 7, 8, 3, 2, 1, 0, 9, 4, 6, 5.

The connections between the vertices based on the given edges are:
- 7: 5
- 8: 1, 7
- 3: 4, 6, 9
- 2: 1, 4, 5
- 1: 2, 5, 6, 8
- 0: 4, 5, 9
- 9: 0, 3, 5, 6
- 4: 0, 2, 3, 6
- 6: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- 5: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method and the given connections, we can find the triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [4]

The unique triangles found are: <4, 0, 5>, <4, 2, 5>, <4, 6, 5>, <6, 3, 9>.
