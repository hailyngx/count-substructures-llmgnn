Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 3 has 2 connections.
Vertex 8 has 2 connections.
Vertex 4 has 3 connections.
Vertices 1, 7, and 9 have 4 connections each.
Vertices 2 and 6 have 5 connections each.
Vertices 0 and 5 have 6 connections each.

Now, we will examine each edge starting from the edge involving the vertex with the lower label and count the triangles:

1. Edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
2. Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (8, 3): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (9, 7): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (9, 0): One triangle formed: <7, 9, 0>.
8. Edge (1, 0): One triangle formed: <1, 7, 0>.
9. Edge (7, 0): One triangle formed: <7, 9, 0>.
10. Edge (6, 1): One triangle formed: <6, 9, 7>.
11. Edge (6, 2): Two triangles formed: <2, 6, 9> and <2, 6, 1>.
12. Edge (6, 3): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (6, 9): One triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>.
14. Edge (0, 1): One triangle formed: <0, 7, 1>.
15. Edge (0, 2): One triangle formed: <0, 9, 2>.
16. Edge (0, 4): One triangle formed: <0, 9, 4>.
17. Edge (0, 5): Two triangles formed: <0, 9, 5> and <0, 7, 5>.
18. Edge (0, 7): One triangle formed: <0, 9, 7>.
19. Edge (0, 9): Three triangles formed: <0, 7, 9>, <0, 9, 4>, and <0, 9, 5>.
20. Edge (5, 0): Two triangles formed: <5, 7, 0> and <5, 9, 0>.
21. Edge (5, 2): One triangle formed: <5, 9, 2>.
22. Edge (5, 4): One triangle formed: <5, 9, 4>.
23. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16], and the unique triangles found are: 
<0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 4>, <0, 9, 5>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 0>, <5, 9, 0>, <5, 9, 2>, <5, 9, 4>, <6, 9, 7>, <7, 9, 0>, <9, 7, 0>.
