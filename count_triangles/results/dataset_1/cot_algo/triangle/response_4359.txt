Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0 has 2 connections.
- Node 1 has 3 connections.
- Node 2 has 4 connections.
- Node 3 has 2 connections.
- Node 4 has 3 connections.
- Node 5 has 4 connections.
- Node 6 has 5 connections.
- Node 7 has 1 connection.
- Node 8 has 4 connections.
- Node 9 has 4 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we look at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 1): Forms triangle <0, 1, 6>.
- Edge (0, 2): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 4): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 5): Forms triangle <2, 5, 8>.
- Edge (2, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 6): Forms triangle <3, 6, 9>.
- Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 8): Forms triangle <5, 8, 9>.
- Edge (5, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 8): Forms triangle <6, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, and <6, 8, 9>.
