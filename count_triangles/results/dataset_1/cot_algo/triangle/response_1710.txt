Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 8 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can find the triangles.

Triangles found:
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
