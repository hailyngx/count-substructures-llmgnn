Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 6

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle <1, 4, 0>.
- Edge (2, 5) forms a triangle <2, 5, 4>.
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle <3, 4, 1>.
- Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle <3, 8, 2>.
- Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle <3, 9, 5>.
- Edge (4, 5) forms a triangle <4, 5, 2>.
- Edge (5, 9) forms a triangle <5, 9, 3>.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle <8, 9, 2>.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
