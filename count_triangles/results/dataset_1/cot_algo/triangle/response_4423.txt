Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their number of connections is as follows: 
Vertices: 
1. Vertex 3 (Degree: 2)
2. Vertex 8 (Degree: 1)
3. Vertex 9 (Degree: 2)
4. Vertex 1 (Degree: 3)
5. Vertex 6 (Degree: 4)
6. Vertex 5 (Degree: 5)
7. Vertex 7 (Degree: 5)
8. Vertex 0 (Degree: 6)
9. Vertex 4 (Degree: 6)
10. Vertex 2 (Degree: 6)

Now, we will iterate through each edge in the graph and count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<0, 2, 7>
