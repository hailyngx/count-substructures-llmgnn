Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degree in ascending order, the new vertex labels will be:  

Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 3: 1 connection  
Node 4: 2 connections  
Node 5: 2 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 7: 5 connections  
Node 8: 1 connection  
Node 9: 3 connections  

Now, applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Both nodes 0 and 1 have 3 connections, so no triangle is formed.
2. Edge (0, 4): Node 0 has 3 connections which is fewer than the 2 connections of node 4. Check for shared connections: 5. Triangle <0, 4, 5>.
3. Edge (0, 5): Node 0 has 3 connections which is fewer than the 2 connections of node 5. Check for shared connections: 4. Triangle <0, 5, 4>.
4. Edge (1, 0): This edge was already considered in step 1.
5. Edge (1, 6): Both nodes 1 and 6 have 3 connections, so no triangle is formed.
6. Edge (1, 7): Node 1 has 3 connections which is fewer than the 5 connections of node 7. Check for shared connections: 6. Triangle <1, 7, 6>.
7. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 has 2 connections which is fewer than the 5 connections of node 7. Check for shared connections: None.
8. Edge (2, 9): Both nodes 2 and 9 have 3 connections, so no triangle is formed.
9. Edge (3, 7): Node 3 has 1 connection which is fewer than the 5 connections of node 7. Check for shared connections: None.
10. Edge (4, 0): This edge was already considered in step 2.
11. Edge (4, 5): This edge was already considered in step 3.
12. Edge (5, 0): This edge was already considered in step 3.
13. Edge (5, 4): This edge was already considered in step 3.
14. Edge (6, 1): This edge was already considered in step 5.
15. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 has 3 connections which is fewer than the 5 connections of node 7. Check for shared connections: None.
16. Edge (6, 8): Node 6 has 3 connections which is fewer than the 1 connection of node 8. Check for shared connections: None.
17. Edge (7, 1): This edge was already considered in step 6.
18. Edge (7, 2): This edge was already considered in step 7.
19. Edge (7, 3): This edge was already considered in step 9.
20. Edge (7, 6): This edge was already considered in step 15.
21. Edge (7, 9): Node 7 has 5 connections which is more than the 3 connections of node 9. Check for shared connections: None.
22. Edge (8, 6): This edge was already considered in step 16.
23. Edge (9, 2): This edge was already considered in step 8.
24. Edge (9, 7): This edge was already considered in step 21.
