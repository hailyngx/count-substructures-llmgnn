Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Sorting vertices based on their degrees, we have the following labels after relabeling: 

Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 8: 0 connections (as it is not present in the given edges)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the edges based on the labels of the vertices. Checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles:

<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 1, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
