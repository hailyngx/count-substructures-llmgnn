Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices: 5, 3, 1, 6, 8, 2, 0, 7, 9, 4

Now, we relabel the vertices accordingly:

5 (0 connections) -> 0
3 (1 connection) -> 1
1 (1 connection) -> 2
6 (1 connection) -> 3
8 (1 connection) -> 4
2 (2 connections) -> 5
0 (3 connections) -> 6
7 (3 connections) -> 7
9 (6 connections) -> 8
4 (6 connections) -> 9

Now, we check the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 2): Both vertices have 3 connections -> No triangle
- Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has 3 connections, Vertex 9 has 6 connections
- Edge (1, 6): Both vertices have 1 connection -> No triangle
- Edge (2, 0): Both vertices have 3 connections -> No triangle
- Edge (4, 7): Both vertices have 3 connections -> No triangle
- Edge (4, 8): Both vertices have 1 connection -> No triangle
- Edge (4, 9): Vertex 4 has 6 connections, Vertex 9 has 6 connections
- Edge (6, 1): Both vertices have 1 connection -> No triangle
- Edge (7, 4): Both vertices have 3 connections -> No triangle
- Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has 3 connections, Vertex 9 has 6 connections
- Edge (8, 4): Vertex 8 has 1 connection, Vertex 4 has 6 connections
- Edge (9, 0): Vertex 9 has 6 connections, Vertex 0 has 3 connections
- Edge (9, 4): Both vertices have 6 connections -> No triangle
- Edge (9, 7): Vertex 9 has 6 connections, Vertex 7 has 3 connections
