Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph sorted by the number of connections for each vertex is: 

Nodes: 1, 4, 8, 0, 9, 3, 6, 7, 2, 5

Reordering the edges based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:

(1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 9), (4, 2), (8, 2), (0, 7), (9, 3), (6, 5), (7, 0), (2, 8), (5, 7), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 2), (7, 5), (7, 6), (9, 1), (9, 7), (3, 1), (3, 9), (6, 7), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (8, 5)

By following the degree-based ordering method and checking for shared connections, we can count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 5>
<7, 9, 3>
