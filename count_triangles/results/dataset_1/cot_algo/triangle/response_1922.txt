Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling the vertices accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is:  
1. Vertex 1: 1 connection  
2. Vertex 3: 1 connection  
3. Vertex 5: 1 connection  
4. Vertex 4: 1 connection  
5. Vertex 0: 2 connections  
6. Vertex 9: 3 connections  
7. Vertex 6: 4 connections  
8. Vertex 7: 4 connections  
9. Vertex 8: 5 connections  
10. Vertex 2: 5 connections  

Now, analyzing each edge in the graph with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections than the higher labeled vertex, we find the triangles formed by shared connections:

1. Edge (0, 9):  
   - Both vertices 0 and 9 have connections with vertex 6, forming a triangle <0, 6, 9>.

2. Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed.

3. Edge (2, 4): No triangles formed.

4. Edge (2, 6):
   - Both vertices 2 and 6 have connections with vertex 7, forming a triangle <2, 6, 7>.  

5. Edge (2, 7): No triangles formed.

6. Edge (2, 8):  
   - Both vertices 2 and 8 have connections with vertex 5, forming a triangle <2, 5, 8>.

7. Edge (3, 1): No triangles formed.

8. Edge (4, 2):
   - Both vertices 2 and 4 have connections with vertex 6, forming a triangle <2, 4, 6>.  

9. Edge (5, 8):
   - Both vertices 5 and 8 have connections with vertex 2, forming a triangle <2, 5, 8>.

10. Edge (6, 2):
   - Both vertices 6 and 2 have connections with vertex 7, forming a triangle <2, 6, 7>.

11. Edge (6, 7):
   - Both vertices 6 and 7 have connections with vertex 2, forming a triangle <2, 6, 7>.

12. Edge (6, 9):  
   - Both vertices 6 and 9 have connections with vertex 0, forming a triangle <0, 6, 9>.

13. Edge (7, 2):  
   - Both vertices 7 and 2 have connections with vertex 6, forming a triangle <2, 6, 7>.

14. Edge (7, 6):
   - Both vertices 7 and 6 have connections with vertex 2, forming a triangle <2, 6, 7>.

15. Edge (7, 8):  
   - Both vertices 7 and 8 have connections with vertex 2, forming a triangle <2, 7, 8>.

16. Edge (8, 2):  
   - Both vertices 8 and 2 have connections with vertex 5, forming a triangle <2, 5, 8>.

17. Edge (8, 5):  
   - Both vertices 8 and 5 have connections with vertex 2, forming a triangle <2, 5, 8>.

18. Edge (8, 7):  
   - Both vertices 8 and 7 have connections with vertex 2, forming a triangle <2, 7, 8>.

19. Edge (8, 9):  
   - Both vertices 8 and 9 have connections with vertex 6, forming a triangle <6, 8, 9>.

20. Edge (9, 0):  
   - Both vertices 9 and 0 have connections with vertex 6, forming a triangle <0, 6, 9>.

21. Edge (9, 6):  
   - Both vertices 9 and 6 have connections with vertex 0, forming a triangle <0, 6, 9>.

22. Edge (9, 8):  
   - Both vertices 9 and 8 have connections with vertex 6, forming a triangle <6, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
