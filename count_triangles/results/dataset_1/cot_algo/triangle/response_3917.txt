Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted based on their degree are: 8, 0, 6, 1, 5, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (8, 9) - Proceed as 8 has fewer connections than 9. Shared connections with 9: none.
2. Edge (0, 1) - Proceed as 0 has fewer connections than 1. Shared connections with 1: 2, 4. Triangle: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>.
3. Edge (6, 1) - Proceed as 6 has fewer connections than 1. Shared connections with 1: 2. Triangle: <6, 1, 2>.
4. Edge (1, 5) - Proceed as 1 has fewer connections than 5. Shared connections with 5: 2. Triangle: <1, 5, 2>.
5. Edge (1, 6) - Proceed as 1 has fewer connections than 6. Shared connections with 6: 2. Triangle: <1, 6, 2>.
6. Edge (5, 1) - Proceed as 5 has fewer connections than 1. Shared connections with 1: 2. Triangle: <5, 1, 2>.
7. Edge (9, 8) - Proceed as 9 has fewer connections than 8. Shared connections with 8: none.
8. Edge (3, 2) - Proceed as 3 has fewer connections than 2. Shared connections with 2: 4. Triangle: <3, 2, 4>.
9. Edge (9, 5) - Proceed as 9 has fewer connections than 5. Shared connections with 5: none.

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 6, 2>, <5, 1, 2>, <3, 2, 4>, <9, 8, 5>.
