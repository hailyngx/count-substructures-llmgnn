Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new vertex labeling will be as follows:
- Node 4 has 0 connections and will be relabeled as node 0.
- Nodes 7 and 9 have 1 connection each and will be relabeled as nodes 1 and 2 (in any order).
- Nodes 8 and 3 have 2 connections each and will be relabeled as nodes 3 and 4 (in any order).
- Nodes 5 and 1 have 4 connections each and will be relabeled as nodes 5 and 6 (in any order).
- Nodes 2 and 6 have 5 connections each and will be relabeled as nodes 7 and 8 (in any order).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 2, 6>
4. <1, 2, 6>
5. <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
