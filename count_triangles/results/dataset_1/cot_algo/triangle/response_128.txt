Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by number of connections (degree-based ordering):
1. 5 connections: 8
2. 4 connections: 1, 3, 6, 7
3. 3 connections: 0, 9
4. 2 connections: 2, 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will traverse the edges to count the number of triangles.

Triangles:
1. <1, 6, 8>
2. <1, 7, 8>
3. <1, 7, 9>
4. <3, 7, 8>
5. <3, 8, 9>
6. <6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
