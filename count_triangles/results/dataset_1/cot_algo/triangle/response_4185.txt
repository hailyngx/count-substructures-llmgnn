Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Node 7 -> A
Node 8 -> B
Node 9 -> C
Node 1 -> D
Node 2 -> E
Node 5 -> F
Node 4 -> G
Node 6 -> H
Node 3 -> I

To count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check each edge starting with the vertex with the lower label.

Checking the edges:
(A, D): A has 1 connection
(B, E): B has 1 connection
(C, I): C has 1 connection
(D, A): No triangle
(E, I): E and I connect at node 3, so triangle <2, 3, 4> found.
(F, I): No triangle
(G, I): G and I connect at node 3, so triangle <3, 4, 6> found.
(H, G): No triangle
(H, I): H and I connect at node 3, so triangle <3, 4, 6> found.

After examining all edges, we have found 3 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
