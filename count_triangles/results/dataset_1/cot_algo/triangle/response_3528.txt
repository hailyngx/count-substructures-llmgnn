Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following labels:
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Examining (0, 5):
Node 0 (4 connections) < Node 5 (4 connections)
Shared connections: 1 (3), 8 (2)
Triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 8>

Examining (0, 7):
Node 0 (4 connections) < Node 7 (3 connections)
Shared connections: 8 (2)
Triangles: <0, 7, 8>

Examining (1, 4):
Node 1 (3 connections) < Node 4 (2 connections)
Shared connections: 3 (5)
Triangles: <1, 3, 4>

Examining (1, 8):
Node 1 (3 connections) < Node 8 (5 connections)
Shared connections: 5 (4)
Triangles: <1, 5, 8>

Examining (2, 3):
Node 2 (1 connection) < Node 3 (5 connections)
No triangles formed.

Examining (2, 9):
Node 2 (1 connection) < Node 9 (3 connections)

Examining (7, 8):
Node 7 (3 connections) < Node 8 (5 connections)
Shared connections: None
No triangles formed.

Examining (8, 1):
Node 8 (5 connections) > Node 1 (3 connections)

Examining (8, 5):
Node 8 (5 connections) > Node 5 (4 connections)

Examining (8, 6):
Node 8 (5 connections) > Node 6 (2 connections)

Examining (8, 7):
