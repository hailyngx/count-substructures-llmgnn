Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling for the vertices will be:
- Node 7 has 0 connection(s)
- Nodes 4 and 8 have 1 connection(s)
- Nodes 1 and 3 have 2 connection(s)
- Nodes 5 and 9 have 3 connection(s)
- Nodes 2 and 6 have 4 connection(s)
- Node 0 has 5 connection(s)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Considering this approach, the triangles in the graph are: 
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
