Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will order the vertices based on their degree and assign labels accordingly:
- Vertex 0 has degree 1
- Vertex 1 has degree 2
- Vertex 7 has degree 2
- Vertex 5 has degree 2
- Vertex 7 has degree 2
- Vertex 4 has degree 3
- Vertex 8 has degree 3
- Vertex 9 has degree 3
- Vertex 3 has degree 4
- Vertex 6 has degree 6

Next, we will list the edges in increasing order of the labels of their endpoints:
1. (0, 3)
2. (1, 2)
3. (1, 9)
4. (2, 6)
5. (2, 7)
6. (3, 4)
7. (3, 6)
8. (3, 8)
9. (5, 6)
10. (5, 9)
11. (6, 4)
12. (6, 8)
13. (6, 9)
14. (8, 9)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the shared connections between the vertices of each edge:
1. Triangle <1, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <3, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
