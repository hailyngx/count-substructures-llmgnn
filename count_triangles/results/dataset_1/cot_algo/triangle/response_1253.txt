Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes by their degrees from least to most connected:
Nodes: 5, 7
Nodes: 0
Nodes: 6 
Nodes: 1, 2
Nodes: 7
Nodes: 9
Nodes: 4
Nodes: 8
Nodes: 3

Counting the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with node 3: <0, 1, 3>
2. Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with node 1: <0, 1, 3>
3. Edge (1, 0) forms a triangle with node 3: <0, 1, 3>
4. Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle with node 6: <1, 4, 6>
5. Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
8. Edge (3, 0) forms a triangle with node 1: <0, 1, 3>
9. Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle with node 4: <3, 4, 9>
11. Edge (4, 1) forms a triangle with node 6: <1, 4, 6>
12. Edge (4, 6) forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 4, 6>
13. Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
14. Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
15. Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 5: <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 9>
16. Edge (5, 9) forms a triangle with node 4: <4, 5, 9>
17. Edge (6, 1) forms a triangle with node 4: <1, 4, 6>
18. Edge (6, 4) forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 4, 6>
19. Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle.
20. Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
21. Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.
22. Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.
23. Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle.
24. Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle with node 4: <4, 8, 9>
25. Edge (9, 3) forms a triangle with node 4: <3, 4, 9>
26. Edge (9, 4) forms a triangle with node 3 and 5: <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 9>
27. Edge (9, 5) forms a triangle with node 4: <4, 5, 9>
28. Edge (9, 8) forms a triangle with node 4: <4, 8, 9>
