Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0 has 2 connections  
Node 5 has 1 connection  
Node 4 has 2 connections  
Node 9 has 2 connections  
Node 8 has 2 connections  
Node 6 has 4 connections  
Node 7 has 0 connections  
Node 3 has 5 connections  
Node 1 has 5 connections  
Node 2 has 5 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will traverse the edges in the following order:  
(0, 5), (4, 6), (8, 9), (6, 9), (5, 0), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 4), (1, 0), (3, 8), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 0), (3, 6), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 1), (9, 6), (9, 1), (8, 1), (4, 2)  

Counting the number of triangles, we find a total of 3 triangles:  
- Triangle 1: <1, 2, 3>  
- Triangle 2: <1, 6, 9>  
- Triangle 3: <4, 6, 2>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
