Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the reordered vertices are: 0, 1, 5, 8, 2, 3, 9, 6, 7, 4.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and analyzing the given edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is 6. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
