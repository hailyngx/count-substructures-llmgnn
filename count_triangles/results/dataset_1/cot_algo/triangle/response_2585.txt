Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices in ascending order of their degrees: [0, 2, 7, 9, 4, 5, 7, 3, 6, 1]

Now, examining each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections to count the triangles:

Triangles found:
<3, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [3]
