Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: degree 4
1: degree 1
2: degree 4
3: degree 1
4: degree 3
5: degree 3
6: degree 2
7: degree 2
8: degree 2
9: degree 4

Now, we will list the edges in the specified order:

(1, 6)
(3, 0)
(7, 4)
(7, 5)
(8, 0)
(8, 9)
(4, 2)
(5, 7)
(6, 2)
(9, 0)
(9, 2)
(9, 8)
(0, 3)
(0, 5)
(0, 8)
(0, 9)
(2, 4)
(2, 5)
(2, 6)
(2, 9)

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles = 6

[6]

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
