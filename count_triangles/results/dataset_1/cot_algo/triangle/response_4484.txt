Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are: 
0 (degree: 4)
1 (degree: 2)
2 (degree: 3)
3 (degree: 4)
4 (degree: 4)
5 (degree: 4)
6 (degree: 1)
7 (degree: 2)
8 (degree: 4)
9 (degree: 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we then assess the edges in the following order:
(2, 8) -> forms triangle with 5 and 9 <2, 5, 8>
(1, 7) -> no triangle formed
(7, 4) -> forms triangle with 1 and 5 <1, 4, 7>
(7, 1) -> no triangle formed
(9, 8) -> forms triangle with 2 and 5 <2, 8, 9>
(9, 0) -> forms triangle with 0 and 5 <0, 5, 9>
(9, 5) -> forms triangle with 0 and 8 <8, 5, 9>
(9, 2) -> forms triangle with 0 and 8 <0, 2, 9>
(8, 5) -> forms triangle with 2 and 9 <2, 5, 8>
(8, 9) -> forms triangle with 2 and 5 <2, 5, 9>
(8, 2) -> forms triangle with 5 and 9 <2, 5, 8>
(4, 5) -> forms triangle with 0 and 3 <0, 4, 5>
(4, 7) -> forms triangle with 1 and 5 <1, 4, 7>
(4, 0) -> forms triangle with 3 and 5 <0, 3, 4>
(5, 9) -> forms triangle with 0 and 8 <0, 5, 9>
(5, 8) -> forms triangle with 2 and 9 <2, 5, 8>
(5, 4) -> forms triangle with 0 and 3 <0, 4, 5>
(5, 3) -> forms triangle with 0 and 4 <0, 3, 5>
(3, 5) -> forms triangle with 0 and 4 <0, 3, 5>
(3, 1) -> no triangle formed
(3, 0) -> forms triangle with 4 and 5 <0, 3, 4>
(2, 9) -> forms triangle with 5 and 8 <2, 5, 9>
(2, 8) -> already counted
(1, 7) -> already counted
(0, 9) -> already counted
(0, 6) -> no triangle formed
(0, 4) -> already counted
(0, 3) -> already counted

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
