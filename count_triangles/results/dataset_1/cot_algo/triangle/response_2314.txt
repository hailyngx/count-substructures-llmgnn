Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them, the new ordering is: 

Nodes: 3, 1, 8, 5, 3, 7, 0, 2, 4, 6. 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph: 

1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 4, 6. Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 5. They share a connection with node 5 forming a triangle <0, 1, 5>.

2. Edge (0, 4): Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 4, 6. Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 8. They share a connection with node 2 forming a triangle <0, 4, 2>.

3. Edge (0, 6): Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 4, 6. Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 5, 7. They share a connection with nodes 2 and 5 forming triangles <0, 6, 2> and <0, 6, 5>.

4. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 5. Node 5 has connections with nodes 1, 2, 6. They share a connection with node 0 forming a triangle <1, 5, 0>.

5. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 8. Node 8 has connections with nodes 4, 7. They share a connection with node 2 forming a triangle <4, 8, 2>.

6. Edge (7, 8): Node 7 has connections with nodes 2, 6, 8. Node 8 has connections with nodes 4, 7. They share a connection with node 4 forming a triangle <7, 8, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
