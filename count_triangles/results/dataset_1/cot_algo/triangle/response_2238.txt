Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the nodes is as follows:
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 2: Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
We begin with the edges involving Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 5), and (0, 7). These form triangles with Node 3, 5, and 7 respectively.
Moving on, we consider the edges involving Node 3: (3, 2) forms a triangle with Node 2.
Next, we look at the edges involving Node 5: (5, 4) forms a triangle with Node 4.
Then, we check the edges involving Node 7: (7, 4) forms a triangle with Node 4.
Lastly, we review the edges involving Node 2: (2, 1) forms a triangle with Node 1 and (2, 5) forms a triangle with Node 5.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <3, 2, 5>, <5, 4, 7>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 5, 4>, and <4, 7, 5>.
