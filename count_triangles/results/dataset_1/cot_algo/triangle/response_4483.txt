Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we get the new labels for the vertices as follows:
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (0, 1) forms triangles with the shared connections (1, 5) and (1, 9) resulting in triangles <0, 1, 5> and <0, 1, 9>.
- (0, 2) does not form a triangle.
- (0, 5) forms a triangle with the shared connection (5, 1) resulting in triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- (0, 9) forms a triangle with the shared connection (9, 1) resulting in a triangle <0, 1, 9>.
- (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
- (1, 4) forms a triangle with the shared connection (4, 5) resulting in triangle <1, 4, 5>.
- (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
- (1, 7) forms a triangle with the shared connection (7, 2) resulting in triangle <1, 7, 2>.
- (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
- (3, 1) does not form a triangle.
- (4, 5) forms a triangle with the shared connection (5, 1) resulting in triangle <4, 1, 5>.
- (5, 9) does not form a triangle.
- (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
- (7, 8) forms a triangle with the shared connections (8, 4) and (8, 9) resulting in triangles <7, 8, 4> and <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 7, 2>, <7, 8, 4>, <7, 8, 9>.
