Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order. The sorted list of vertices is as follows:
```
1. 4 (degree 1)
2. 1 (degree 1)
3. 7 (degree 1)
4. 8 (degree 1)
5. 9 (degree 1)
6. 6 (degree 2)
7. 2 (degree 2)
8. 5 (degree 3)
0. 0 (degree 3)
```

By following the method where we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will examine the following edges:
(1, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 8), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 0)

Checking for shared connections to find triangles:
- Triangle involving (6, 7) and their shared connection with 8: <6, 7, 8>
- Triangle involving (6, 8) with shared connections 7 and 6: <6, 7, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
