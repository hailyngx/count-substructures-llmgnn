Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 1: 7 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree in increasing order:
0 - 2
2 - 1
4 - 4
6 - 3
8 - 5
1 - 8
9 - 6
3 - 9
5 - 7
7 - 10

Next, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles. We proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. (0, 1): No triangle
2. (0, 3): No triangle
3. (0, 5): No triangle
4. (0, 8): No triangle
5. (1, 4): No triangle
6. (1, 5): No triangle
7. (1, 6): No triangle
8. (1, 7): Triangle <0, 1, 7>
9. (1, 8): No triangle
10. (1, 9): Triangle <0, 1, 9>
11. (2, 3): No triangle
12. (2, 7): No triangle
13. (2, 9): No triangle
14. (3, 4): No triangle
15. (3, 5): Triangle <0, 3, 5>
16. (3, 7): Triangle <0, 3, 7>
17. (4, 3): No triangle
18. (5, 6): No triangle
19. (5, 7): No triangle
20. (6, 5): No triangle
21. (7, 8): No triangle
22. (7, 9): No triangle
23. (8, 9): No triangle

Count of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 7>
