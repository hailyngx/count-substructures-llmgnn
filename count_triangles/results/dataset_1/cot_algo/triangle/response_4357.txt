Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 3: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge in increasing order of node degrees:

1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 has 5 connections, Node 2 has 5 connections. They share connections with Nodes 4 and 8 forming the triangle <0, 2, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 4): Node 0 has 5 connections, Node 4 has 3 connections. They share connections with Nodes 2 and 8 forming the triangle <0, 4, 2>.
3. Edge (0, 5): Node 0 has 5 connections, Node 5 has 5 connections. They share connections with Nodes 1, 4, and 8 forming the triangle <0, 5, 1>.
4. Edge (0, 8): Node 0 has 5 connections, Node 8 has 6 connections. They share connections with Nodes 2, 4, and 7 forming the triangle <0, 8, 4>.
5. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 has 5 connections, Node 9 has 3 connections. They share connections forming the triangle <0, 9, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
