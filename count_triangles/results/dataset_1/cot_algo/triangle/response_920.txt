Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 0(5), 1(2), 2(3), 3(2), 4(2), 5(3), 6(2), 7(1), 8(4), 9(2).

Now, we will relabel the vertices: 
Label: 7(0), 1(1), 3(2), 4(3), 6(4), 9(5), 0(6), 2(7), 5(8), 8(9).

Now, we will go through the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
Edges: (1, 3), (3, 5), (4, 8), (6, 9), (0, 5), (0, 8).

Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections:
Triangles: <1, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 8>.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
