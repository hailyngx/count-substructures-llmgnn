Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their degree:
```
0: 1 connection
1: 1 connection
3: 1 connection
5: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
9: 4 connections
2: 5 connections
4: 5 connections
```
