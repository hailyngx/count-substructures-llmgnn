Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
```
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
```

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles and list them:
Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 1>
