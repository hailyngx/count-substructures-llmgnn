Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly. The sorted list of vertices is: 

Vertices: 3, 0, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 1, 4, 2

Now, let's identify the triangles formed by the shared connections:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 1>
3. Triangle <1, 6, 3>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <4, 8, 2>
6. Triangle <4, 9, 2>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
