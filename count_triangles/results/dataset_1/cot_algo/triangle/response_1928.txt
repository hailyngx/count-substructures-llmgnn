Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: degree 1
Node 1: degree 3
Node 3: degree 1
Node 5: degree 1
Node 6: degree 1
Node 7: degree 1
Node 8: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0 -> Node 0
Node 1 -> Node 3
Node 3 -> Node 1
Node 5 -> Node 5
Node 6 -> Node 6
Node 7 -> Node 7
Node 8 -> Node 1
Node 4 -> Node 2

Next, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles formed:

<1, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 8>

Finally, we count the total number of triangles found: [2].
