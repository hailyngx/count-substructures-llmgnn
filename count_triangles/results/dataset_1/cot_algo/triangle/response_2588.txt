Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 8: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections

Given this ordering, we can analyze the edges:

1. Edge between Node 0 and Node 1:
   - Shared connections: Node 3, Node 6, Node 9
   - Triangle: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>

2. Edge between Node 0 and Node 3:
   - Shared connections: None
   - No triangle.

3. Edge between Node 0 and Node 6:
   - Shared connections: None
   - No triangle.

4. Edge between Node 0 and Node 9:
   - Shared connections: None
   - No triangle.

5. Edge between Node 1 and Node 2:
   - Shared connections: None
   - No triangle.

6. Edge between Node 1 and Node 4:
   - Shared connections: None
   - No triangle.

7. Edge between Node 2 and Node 6:
   - Shared connections: None
   - No triangle.

8. Edge between Node 2 and Node 7:
   - Shared connections: None
   - No triangle.

9. Edge between Node 3 and Node 5:
   - Shared connections: None
   - No triangle.

10. Edge between Node 4 and Node 7:
   - Shared connections: None
   - No triangle.

11. Edge between Node 8 and Node 9:
   - Shared connections: None
   - No triangle.

12. Edge between Node 9 and Node 4:
   - Shared connections: None
   - No triangle.

13. Edge between Node 2 and Node 1:
   - Shared connections: None
   - No triangle.

14. Edge between Node 7 and Node 4:
   - Shared connections: None
   - No triangle.

In total, there are 3 unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
