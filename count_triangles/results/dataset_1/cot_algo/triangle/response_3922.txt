Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps us count the number of triangles efficiently. Let's follow the steps:

1. Calculate the degree of each vertex:
   - Vertex 1: 2 edges
   - Vertex 2: 3 edges
   - Vertex 3: 3 edges
   - Vertex 4: 3 edges
   - Vertex 5: 3 edges
   - Vertex 6: 3 edges
   - Vertex 7: 2 edges
   - Vertex 8: 2 edges
   - Vertex 9: 1 edge

2. Sort the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:
   - Vertex 9 (1 edge) -> Relabeled as vertex 1
   - Vertex 7 (2 edges) -> Relabeled as vertex 2
   - Vertex 8 (2 edges) -> Relabeled as vertex 3
   - Vertex 1 (2 edges) -> Relabeled as vertex 4
   - Vertex 2 (3 edges) -> Relabeled as vertex 5
   - Vertex 3 (3 edges) -> Relabeled as vertex 6
   - Vertex 4 (3 edges) -> Relabeled as vertex 7
   - Vertex 5 (3 edges) -> Relabeled as vertex 8
   - Vertex 6 (3 edges) -> Relabeled as vertex 9

3. Analyze each edge starting from the one with the lowest label:
   - Edge (9, 5): No triangles formed.
   - Edge (7, 2): No triangles formed.
   - Edge (8, 3): No triangles formed.
   - Edge (1, 4): Triangle formed with Vertex 6: <1, 4, 6>
   - Edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.
   - Edge (3, 6): Triangle formed with Vertex 4: <3, 6, 4>
   - Edge (4, 7): Triangle formed with Vertex 1: <4, 7, 1>
   - Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.
   - Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.

4. Count the total number of triangles and list them:
   - Total number of triangles: [3]
   - Unique triangles:
     <1, 4, 6>
     <3, 6, 4>
     <4, 7, 1>
