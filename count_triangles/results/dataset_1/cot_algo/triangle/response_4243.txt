Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
By sorting the nodes based on their degree, we have the following order: 2, 8, 6, 0, 9, 3, 5, 7, 1, 4.

Now, we will count the triangles by checking the shared connections between vertices of each edge:

1. Edge (0, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
2. Edge (0, 8) doesn't form a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
4. Edge (1, 5) doesn't form a triangle.
5. Edge (1, 7) doesn't form a triangle.
6. Edge (1, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
7. Edge (2, 0) doesn't form a triangle.
8. Edge (2, 4) doesn't form a triangle.
9. Edge (3, 1) forms a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
10. Edge (3, 4) doesn't form a triangle.
11. Edge (3, 7) doesn't form a triangle.
12. Edge (4, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
13. Edge (4, 3) doesn't form a triangle.
14. Edge (4, 5) forms a triangle <1, 4, 5>.
15. Edge (5, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
16. Edge (5, 4) forms a triangle <1, 4, 5>.
17. Edge (6, 8) doesn't form a triangle.
18. Edge (7, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
19. Edge (7, 3) doesn't form a triangle.
20. Edge (8, 0) doesn't form a triangle.
21. Edge (8, 6) doesn't form a triangle.
22. Edge (9, 1) doesn't form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 4> and <1, 4, 5>.
