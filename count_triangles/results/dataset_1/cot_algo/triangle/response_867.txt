Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly.

Number of connections for each vertex:
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections

Therefore, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Vertex 9 -> 0
Vertex 5 -> 1
Vertex 6 -> 2
Vertex 1 -> 3
Vertex 4 -> 4
Vertex 2 -> 5
Vertex 7 -> 6
Vertex 8 -> 7
Vertex 0 -> 8
Vertex 3 -> 9

Now, we will examine each edge to count the triangles by following the degree-based ordering method.

Count of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
