Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 1(1 connection), 2(0 connections), 5(1 connection), 7(1 connection), 8(1 connection), 9(1 connection), 0(4 connections), 3(4 connections), 4(4 connections), 6(5 connections). 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 3): Forms triangle with vertex 6. Triangle <0, 3, 6> found.
- Edge (0, 4): Forms triangle with vertex 6. Triangle <0, 4, 6> found.
- Edge (0, 6): Forms triangle with vertex 4 and 9. Triangles <0, 6, 4> and <0, 6, 9> found.
- Edge (0, 9): No additional triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 9>.
