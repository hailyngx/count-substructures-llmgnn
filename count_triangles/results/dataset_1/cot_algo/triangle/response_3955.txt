Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Then, we relabel the vertices according to their sorted order.

The sorted order of the vertices based on the number of connections is as follows:
Node 3 : 0 connections
Node 6 : 0 connections
Node 0 : 4 connections
Node 1 : 4 connections
Node 2 : 3 connections
Node 5 : 3 connections
Node 7 : 3 connections
Node 8 : 3 connections
Node 9 : 5 connections
Node 4 : 5 connections

Now, we will check each edge with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 4): Check shared connections between Node 0 and Node 4. Shared connection with Node 5 forms triangle <0, 5, 4>.
- Edge (0, 5): Check shared connections between Node 0 and Node 5. No triangles found.
- Edge (0, 7): Check shared connections between Node 0 and Node 7. No triangles found.
- Edge (0, 8): Check shared connections between Node 0 and Node 8. No triangles found.
- Edge (1, 4): Check shared connections between Node 1 and Node 4. No triangles found.
- Edge (1, 8): Check shared connections between Node 1 and Node 8. No triangles found.
- Edge (1, 9): Check shared connections between Node 1 and Node 9. No triangles found.
- Edge (2, 7): Check shared connections between Node 2 and Node 7. No triangles found.
- Edge (2, 9): Check shared connections between Node 2 and Node 9. No triangles found.
- Edge (4, 5): Check shared connections between Node 4 and Node 5. No triangles found.
- Edge (4, 9): Check shared connections between Node 4 and Node 9. No triangles found.
- Edge (5, 9): Check shared connections between Node 5 and Node 9. No triangles found.
- Edge (7, 8): Check shared connections between Node 7 and Node 8. No triangles found.

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [1] and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 4>.
