Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 5), (1, 9), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 7), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by their degree:
2 (0 connections)
3 (0 connections)
7 (1 connection)
2 (1 connection)
6 (2 connections)
5 (2 connections)
3 (2 connections)
2 (3 connections)
1 (4 connections)
1 (5 connections)
