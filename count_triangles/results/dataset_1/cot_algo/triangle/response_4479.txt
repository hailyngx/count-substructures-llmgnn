Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:  

- Node 0 has 2 connections.
- Node 1 has 1 connection.
- Node 2 has 3 connections.
- Node 3 has 1 connection.
- Node 4 has 1 connection.
- Node 5 has 5 connections.
- Node 6 has 3 connections.
- Node 7 has 2 connections.
- Node 8 has 3 connections.
- Node 9 has 2 connections.

We will relabel the nodes accordingly:

Nodes by connections: 1, 3, 4, 0, 7, 9, 2, 6, 8, 5 

Now let's count the triangles:

1. (1, 3, 5)
2. (2, 4, 5)
3. (0, 7, 6)
4. (0, 8, 5)
5. (7, 6, 2)
6. (8, 9, 5)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<1, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 8, 5>, <7, 6, 2>, <8, 9, 5>.
