Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes with their respective connections:
0: 5 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 1 connection
7: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 5 connections

Now, we need to relabel the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:

6: 1 connection
7: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 4 connections
0: 5 connections
9: 5 connections

Now, we will count the triangles based on the given connections:

- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 4: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 5: <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle 6: <2, 3, 8>
- Triangle 7: <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle 8: <3, 4, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph as shown above.
