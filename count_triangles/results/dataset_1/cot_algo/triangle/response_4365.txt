Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. 

Nodes by degree:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 0: 7 connections

Now, we go through each edge, starting from the one with the node of lower degree.

1. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 has degree 1, so we proceed. No triangles found.
2. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 has degree 2, so we proceed. No triangles found.
3. Edge (3, 5): Node 3 has degree 1, so we proceed. No triangles found.
4. Edge (4, 0): Node 0 has degree 7, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections with Node 4 and 0: 1 (Node 7)
5. Edge (5, 3): Node 3 has degree 1, so we proceed. No triangles found.
6. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 has degree 5, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections with Node 5 and 6: 1 (Node 7)
7. Edge (6, 1): Node 1 has degree 1, so we proceed. No triangles found.
8. Edge (7, 0): Node 0 has degree 7, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections with Node 7 and 0: 1 (Node 4)
    - Shared connections with Node 7 and 0: 1 (Node 9)
9. Edge (8, 4): Node 4 has degree 3, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections with Node 8 and 4: 1 (Node 5)
10. Edge (9, 0): Node 0 has degree 7, so we proceed. 
    - Shared connections with Node 9 and 0: 1 (Node 5)

After checking all edges, we have found a total of 4 triangles in the graph. 

The triangles are: 
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 0>
<5, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
