Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:

Vertices by the number of connections:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 1
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 1
- Vertex 9: degree 1

Now, we relabel the vertices:
- Vertex 1 (originally 0) with degree 1
- Vertex 0 (originally 1) with degree 3
- Vertex 5 (originally 2) with degree 2
- Vertex 9 (originally 3) with degree 1
- Vertex 2 (originally 4) with degree 3
- Vertex 7 (originally 5) with degree 2
- Vertex 3 (originally 6) with degree 4
- Vertex 6 (originally 7) with degree 3
- Vertex 8 (originally 8) with degree 1
- Vertex 4 (originally 9) with degree 3

Now, let's count the triangles:
- From edge (0, 3), we find the triangle: <0, 3, 2>
- From edge (0, 4), we find the triangle: <0, 4, 2>
- From edge (0, 6), we find the triangle: <0, 6, 3>
- From edge (1, 6), we find no triangle as vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 6.
- From edge (2, 3), we find the triangle: <2, 3, 0>
- From edge (2, 4), we find the triangle: <2, 4, 0>
- From edge (2, 5), we find no triangle as vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 5.
- From edge (3, 0), we find the triangle: <3, 0, 2>
- From edge (3, 2), we find the triangle: <3, 2, 0>
- From edge (3, 7), we find the triangle: <3, 7, 6>
- From edge (4, 0), we find the triangle: <4, 0, 2>
- From edge (4, 2), we find the triangle: <4, 2, 0>
- From edge (4, 9), we find the triangle: <4, 9, 0>
- From edge (5, 2), we find no triangle as vertex 5 has fewer connections than vertex 2.
- From edge (5, 6), we find the triangle: <5, 6, 0>
- From edge (6, 0), we find the triangle: <6, 0, 3>
- From edge (6, 1), we find no triangle as vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 1.
- From edge (6, 5), we find the triangle: <6, 5, 2>
- From edge (7, 3), we find the triangle: <7, 3, 0>
- From edge (7, 8), we find no triangle as vertex 7 has fewer connections than vertex 8.
- From edge (8, 7), we find no triangle as vertex 8 has fewer connections than vertex 7.
- From edge (9, 4), we find the triangle: <9, 4, 0>
