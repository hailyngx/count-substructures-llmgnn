Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 0: 4 connections

Next, we relabel the nodes based on their degree:

Node 9: 0 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections

Now, we can go through the edges to count the triangles:

Triangle <0, 1, 4>
Triangle <0, 1, 5>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
