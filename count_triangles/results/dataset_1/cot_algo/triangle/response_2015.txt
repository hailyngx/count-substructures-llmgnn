Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, from least to most:

Node 6: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:

For the edge (0, 1), both vertices have 4 connections each, so we proceed.
0 and 1 share 2 connections: 2, 5.
This forms the triangle <0, 1, 2>.

For the edge (0, 2), 0 has 4 connections while 2 has 4 connections. We proceed.
0 and 2 share 2 connections: 1, 5.
This forms the triangle <0, 2, 1>.

For the edge (0, 5), both vertices have 3 connections each, so we proceed.
0 and 5 share 2 connections: 1, 2.
This forms the triangle <0, 5, 1>.

For the edge (0, 9), 0 has 4 connections while 9 has 5 connections. We skip this edge.

For the edge (1, 2), both vertices have 4 connections each, so we proceed.
1 and 2 share 2 connections: 0, 5.
This forms the triangle <1, 2, 0>.
