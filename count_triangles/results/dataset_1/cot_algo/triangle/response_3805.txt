Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices: 0(2), 1(3), 2(2), 3(3), 4(6), 5(3), 6(3), 7(6), 8(2), 9(3)

Edges to process according to the degree-based ordering:
(0, 9), (2, 4), (8, 4), (1, 3), (5, 8), (6, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 7), (8, 5), (7, 9), (1, 4), (1, 6), (4, 7), (7, 4), (4, 8), (7, 2), (7, 5), (6, 1), (7, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6)
