Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

The degrees of each vertex are:
- Vertex 0: Degree 2
- Vertex 1: Degree 1
- Vertex 2: Degree 2
- Vertex 4: Degree 3
- Vertex 5: Degree 4
- Vertex 6: Degree 2
- Vertex 7: Degree 2
- Vertex 8: Degree 1
- Vertex 9: Degree 4

Sorting the vertices by degree in ascending order:
- Vertex 1 and Vertex 8
- Vertex 0, Vertex 7, and Vertex 2
- Vertex 6
- Vertex 4
- Vertex 9
- Vertex 5

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 5)
   - Check for shared connections: 5
   - Triangle: <0, 5, 4>

2. Edge (0, 7)
   - Check for shared connections: None

3. Edge (1, 2)
   - Check for shared connections: None

4. Edge (2, 4)
   - Check for shared connections: None

5. Edge (4, 5)
   - Check for shared connections: 5

6. Edge (4, 9)
   - Check for shared connections: None

7. Edge (5, 7)
   - Check for shared connections: None

8. Edge (6, 8)
   - Check for shared connections: None

9. Edge (6, 9)
   - Check for shared connections: 6

10. Edge (9, 6)
    - Check for shared connections: 6
    - Triangle: <6, 9, 4>

Total number of triangles: [2]
