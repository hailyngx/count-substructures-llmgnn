Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Here is the solution to counting the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabel them accordingly:
   Vertices: 9, 0, 6, 1, 7, 5, 8, 3, 4, 2
   Connections: 4, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 5

2. Start counting triangles using the sorted vertices and given edges:
   - Edge (0, 2): Check for shared connections between 0 and 2. Triangle found: <0, 2, 4>.
   - Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 3, so proceed.
   - Edge (1, 3): Check for shared connections between 1 and 3. No triangle found.
   - Edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 6, so proceed.
   - Edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 9, so proceed.
   - Edge (2, 0): Skip as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 0.
   - Edge (2, 4): Check for shared connections between 2 and 4. Triangle found: <0, 2, 4>.
   - Edge (2, 5): Check for shared connections between 2 and 5. Triangle found: <2, 4, 5>.
   - Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 6, so skip.
   - Edge (2, 7): Check for shared connections between 2 and 7. No triangle found.
   - Edge (3, 0): Vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 0, so skip.
   - Edge (3, 1): Vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 1, so skip.
   - Edge (3, 7): Check for shared connections between 3 and 7. No triangle found.
   - Edge (4, 2): Skip as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 2.
   - Edge (4, 5): Check for shared connections between 4 and 5. No triangle found.
   - Edge (4, 9): Check for shared connections between 4 and 9. No triangle found.
   - Edge (5, 2): Skip as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 2.
   - Edge (5, 4): Skip as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 4.
   - Edge (5, 8): Check for shared connections between 5 and 8. No triangle found.
   - Edge (6, 1): Vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 1, so skip.
   - Edge (6, 2): Vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 2, so skip.
   - Edge (7, 2): Vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 2, so skip.
   - Edge (7, 3): Vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 3, so skip.
   - Edge (8, 5): Skip as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 5.
   - Edge (8, 9): Check for shared connections between 8 and 9. No triangle found.
   - Edge (9, 1): Vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 1, so skip.
   - Edge (9, 4): Check for shared connections between 9 and 4. No triangle found.
   - Edge (9, 8): Check for shared connections between 9 and 8. No triangle found.

3. The total number of triangles in the graph is [2] (meaning 2 unique triangles were found).
   The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4> and <2, 4, 5>.
