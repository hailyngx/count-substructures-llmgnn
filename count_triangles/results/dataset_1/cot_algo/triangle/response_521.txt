Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted vertices are: 

Node 5 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 3)
Node 6 (Degree 3)
Node 9 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 4)
Node 7 (Degree 4)
Node 2 (Degree 4)
Node 8 (Degree 5)
Node 3 (Degree 5)
Node 0 (Degree 6)

Now, we will iterate through the edges based on the order of the nodes:

1. Edge (5, 2) - No triangles
2. Edge (4, 1) - No triangles
3. Edge (6, 3) - No triangles
4. Edge (9, 0) - No triangles
5. Edge (1, 0) - Triangle <0, 1, 9>
6. Edge (7, 3) - Triangle <3, 7, 9>
7. Edge (2, 1) - Triangle <1, 2, 3>
8. Edge (8, 0) - Triangle <0, 7, 8>
9. Edge (3, 2) - No triangles

The total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <0, 7, 8>.
