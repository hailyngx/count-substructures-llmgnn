Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's label the nodes based on their degree:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 1: 6 connections
- Node 4: 7 connections

Next, we will go through each edge in the graph, starting with edges involving nodes with the lower labels, and count the triangles formed by shared connections.

Triangles:
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 8, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
