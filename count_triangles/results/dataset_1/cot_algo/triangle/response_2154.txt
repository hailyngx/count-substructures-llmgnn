Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling the vertices, we get the following sorted vertices: 
Vertices: 2, 6, 7, 5, 8, 0, 3, 1

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges:
- Edge (0, 1): No triangle formed
- Edge (0, 8): No triangle formed
- Edge (1, 3): Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Edge (1, 5): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 6): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 7): No triangle formed
- Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed

After calculating, we find that there are 1 triangle in the given graph:
