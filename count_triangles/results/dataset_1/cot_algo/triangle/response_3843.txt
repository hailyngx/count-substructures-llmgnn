Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following new labels: 

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge between vertex 0 and vertex 9 (0, 9)
   - Shared connections with vertex 9: [5]
   - This forms a triangle: <0, 5, 9>

2. Edge between vertex 1 and vertex 4 (1, 4)
   - Shared connections with vertex 4: [2]
   - This forms a triangle: <1, 2, 4>

3. Edge between vertex 1 and vertex 8 (1, 8)
   - Shared connections with vertex 8: []
   - No triangle formed.

4. Edge between vertex 2 and vertex 4 (2, 4)
   - Shared connections with vertex 4: [1]
   - This forms a triangle: <1, 2, 4>

5. Edge between vertex 2 and vertex 5 (2, 5)
   - Shared connections with vertex 5: []
   - No triangle formed.

6. Edge between vertex 2 and vertex 6 (2, 6)
   - Shared connections with vertex 6: [3]
   - This forms a triangle: <2, 3, 6>

7. Edge between vertex 3 and vertex 6 (3, 6)
   - Shared connections with vertex 6: []
   - No triangle formed.

8. Edge between vertex 4 and vertex 7 (4, 7)
   - Shared connections with vertex 7: []
   - No triangle formed.

9. Edge between vertex 6 and vertex 7 (6, 7)
   - Shared connections with vertex 7: []
   - No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <0, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 3, 6>
