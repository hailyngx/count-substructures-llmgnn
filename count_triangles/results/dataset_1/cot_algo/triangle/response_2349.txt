Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following order: 

Vertices: 4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 9, 7, 8, 6, 0

Relabeled vertices: 
0 -> 4
1 -> 5
2 -> 3
3 -> 2
4 -> 1
5 -> 9
6 -> 7
7 -> 8
8 -> 6
9 -> 0

Now, we will count the triangles based on the given edges:

Triangular connections:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 2>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 8, 4>
<8, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
