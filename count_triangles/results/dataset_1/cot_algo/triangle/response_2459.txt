Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
By applying this method, counting the number of triangles in the graph results in a total of 7 triangles inside brackets [7]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
