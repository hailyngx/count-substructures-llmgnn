Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 9 (degree 5)
- Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 4 (degree 4)
- Node 8 (degree 4)
- Node 0 (degree 5)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 2)
- Node 7 (degree 4)
- Node 2 (degree 3)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles and list them:

Number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <5, 7, 9>
