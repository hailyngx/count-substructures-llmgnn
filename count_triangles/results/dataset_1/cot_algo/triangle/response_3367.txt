Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

0 -> degree 4
1 -> degree 2
2 -> degree 1
4 -> degree 6
5 -> degree 3
6 -> degree 3
7 -> degree 2
9 -> degree 3

Now, we will list the edges according to the degree-based ordering, considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Edges to consider:
(0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 6), (6, 7), (6, 9)

Now, we will check for shared connections to find the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [3]
