Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 9: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles and find the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles: 
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 9, 3>
<3, 9, 7>
<4, 9, 7>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 8, 2>
<5, 4, 1>
