Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled based on their number of connections:
Vertices in sorted order: 1, 2, 0, 6, 5, 4, 7, 3, 9, 8

After relabeling, the edges in the graph are:
(1, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7)

Using the relabeled vertices and the sorted edges, we can count the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle involving vertices: 1, 2, 5
2. Triangle involving vertices: 1, 3, 5
3. Triangle involving vertices: 1, 3, 7
4. Triangle involving vertices: 1, 5, 6
5. Triangle involving vertices: 3, 4, 7
6. Triangle involving vertices: 4, 5, 7
7. Triangle involving vertices: 8, 0, 3
8. Triangle involving vertices: 8, 3, 5

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8] and the unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <8, 0, 3>, <8, 3, 5>.
