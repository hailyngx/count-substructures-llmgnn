Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0 (degree: 1)
- Vertex 5 (degree: 1)
- Vertex 6 (degree: 1)
- Vertex 8 (degree: 2)
- Vertex 9 (degree: 3)
- Vertex 2 (degree: 4)
- Vertex 3 (degree: 4)
- Vertex 1 (degree: 5)
- Vertex 7 (degree: 5)
- Vertex 4 (degree: 7)

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Vertex 0 (degree: 1) -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 5 (degree: 1) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 6 (degree: 1) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 8 (degree: 2) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 9 (degree: 3) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 2 (degree: 4) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 3 (degree: 4) -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 1 (degree: 5) -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 7 (degree: 5) -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 4 (degree: 7) -> Vertex 9

Now we will check each edge using the degree-based ordering method. To ensure the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will only consider the following edges:
- (0, 4)
- (1, 4)
- (1, 7)
- (1, 9)
- (3, 4)
- (3, 7)
- (3, 8)
- (4, 6)
- (5, 8)
- (8, 9)

After checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
