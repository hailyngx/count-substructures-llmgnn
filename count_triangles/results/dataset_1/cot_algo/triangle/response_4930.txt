Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   - Vertex 9 has 1 connection
   - Vertices 3, 6, and 8 have 2 connections each
   - Vertices 2 and 4 have 3 connections each
   - Vertices 1 and 5 have 5 connections each
   - Vertex 0 has 7 connections
   - Vertex 7 has 8 connections

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Vertex 9 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 0
   - Vertices 3, 6, and 8 (2 connections) become Vertices 1, 2, and 3
   - Vertices 2, 4 (3 connections) become Vertices 4, 5
   - Vertices 1, 5 (5 connections) become Vertices 6, 7
   - Vertex 0 (7 connections) becomes Vertex 8
   - Vertex 7 (8 connections) becomes Vertex 9

3. Now, reevaluate the edges based on the new vertex labels:
   - The edges become: (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4)

4. Count the number of triangles formed based on shared connections:
   - Total number of triangles = 11
   - Unique triangles: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <3, 0, 5>, <5, 4, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
