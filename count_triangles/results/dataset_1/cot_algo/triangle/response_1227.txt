Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections (degree) in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly. 

The sorted vertices are: 
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

Following the method, we will consider the edges with vertices in increasing order based on their new labels. 

Now, counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[10] triangles

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
