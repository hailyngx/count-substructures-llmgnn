Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their number of connections are: 

Vertex 1: 0 connections <br>
Vertex 0: 1 connection <br>
Vertex 5: 2 connections <br>
Vertex 3: 2 connections <br>
Vertex 1: 2 connections <br>
Vertex 7: 3 connections <br>
Vertex 4: 3 connections <br>
Vertex 6: 6 connections <br>
Vertex 2: 7 connections <br>
Vertex 8: 5 connections <br>

Using this ordering, we count the number of triangles:
Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
