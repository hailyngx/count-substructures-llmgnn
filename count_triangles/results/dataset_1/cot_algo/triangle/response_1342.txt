Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0 has 3 connections
- Vertex 1 has 3 connections
- Vertex 2 has 2 connections
- Vertex 4 has 1 connection
- Vertex 5 has 2 connections
- Vertex 6 has 4 connections
- Vertex 7 has 2 connections
- Vertex 8 has 5 connections
- Vertex 9 has 2 connections

Next, we need to relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
- Vertex 4 (1 connection) is relabeled as 0
- Vertex 2 (2 connections) is relabeled as 1
- Vertex 7 (2 connections) is relabeled as 2
- Vertex 9 (2 connections) is relabeled as 3
- Vertex 5 (2 connections) is relabeled as 4
- Vertex 0 (3 connections) is relabeled as 5
- Vertex 1 (3 connections) is relabeled as 6
- Vertex 6 (4 connections) is relabeled as 7
- Vertex 8 (5 connections) is relabeled as 8

Now, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (4, 9) will form a triangle with vertices 0, 3, and 4 (triangle <0, 3, 4>)
- Edge (2, 6) will form a triangle with vertices 1, 3, and 7 (triangle <1, 3, 7>)
- Edge (0, 6) will form a triangle with vertices 3, 5, and 7 (triangle <3, 5, 7>)
- Edge (8, 0) will form a triangle with vertices 5, 6, and 8 (triangle <5, 6, 8>)
- Edge (8, 1) will form a triangle with vertices 4, 6, and 8 (triangle <4, 6, 8>)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
