Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections:
Node 1: 2 connections
Nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9: 3 connections
Nodes 0, 5: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Based on the lowest degree vertex rule, we can now count the triangles:

Triangles involving Node 1:
- (1, 2, 9)

Triangles involving Node 3:
- None

Triangles involving Node 4:
- (1, 2, 4)
- (2, 4, 8)

Triangles involving Node 6:
- (0, 6, 8)

Triangles involving Node 7:
- None

Triangles involving Node 8:
- (1, 8, 9)

Triangles involving Node 9:
- None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 6, and the unique triangles are:
<1, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, and <1, 8, 9>.
