Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 0 has degree 1  
Vertex 1 has degree 1  
Vertex 4 has degree 2  
Vertex 5 has degree 2  
Vertex 9 has degree 2  
Vertex 2 has degree 3  
Vertex 6 has degree 3  
Vertex 3 has degree 4  
Vertex 7 has degree 4  

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 0 (degree 1) -> Vertex 0 (new label: 0)  
Vertex 1 (degree 1) -> Vertex 1 (new label: 1)  
Vertex 4 (degree 2) -> Vertex 2 (new label: 2)  
Vertex 5 (degree 2) -> Vertex 3 (new label: 3)  
Vertex 9 (degree 2) -> Vertex 4 (new label: 4)  
Vertex 2 (degree 3) -> Vertex 5 (new label: 5)  
Vertex 6 (degree 3) -> Vertex 6 (new label: 6)  
Vertex 3 (degree 4) -> Vertex 7 (new label: 7)  
Vertex 7 (degree 4) -> Vertex 8 (new label: 8)  

Now, we will examine each edge and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 9): Both vertices have degrees less than 9, so we proceed.  
2. Edge (1, 7): Both vertices have degrees less than 7, so we proceed.  
3. Edge (2, 3): Both vertices have degrees less than 3, so we proceed. This forms a triangle with vertex 4.  
4. Edge (2, 6): Vertex 5 (new label 2) has degree 3, so we don't count this edge.  
5. Edge (3, 2): Vertex 7 (new label 3) has degree 4, so we don't count this edge.  
6. Edge (3, 6): Vertex 7 (new label 3) has degree 4, so we don't count this edge.  
7. Edge (4, 5): Both vertices have degrees less than 5, so we proceed. This forms a triangle with vertex 2.  
8. Edge (4, 7): Vertex 8 (new label 4) has degree 4, so we don't count this edge. This forms a triangle with vertex 2.  
9. Edge (5, 4): Both vertices have degrees less than 4, so we proceed. This forms a triangle with vertex 3.  
10. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 8 (new label 4) has degree 4, so we don't count this edge. This forms a triangle with vertex 3.  
11. Edge (6, 2): Vertex 5 (new label 2) has degree 3, so we don't count this edge.  
12. Edge (6, 3): Vertex 7 (new label 3) has degree 4, so we don't count this edge.  
13. Edge (7, 1): Vertex 8 (new label 4) has degree 4, so we don't count this edge.  
14. Edge (7, 4): Vertex 8 (new label 4) has degree 4, so we don't count this edge. This forms a triangle with vertex 2.  
15. Edge (7, 5): Vertex 8 (new label 4) has degree 4, so we don't count this edge. This forms a triangle with vertex 3.  
16. Edge (9, 0): Both vertices have degrees less than 0, so we proceed.  

After examining all edges, we find the following triangles:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
