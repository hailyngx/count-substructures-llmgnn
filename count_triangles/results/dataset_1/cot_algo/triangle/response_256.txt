Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0: degree of 2
Node 1: degree of 1
Node 2: degree of 3
Node 3: degree of 2
Node 4: degree of 2
Node 5: degree of 2
Node 6: degree of 1
Node 7: degree of 1
Node 8: degree of 4
Node 9: degree of 1

Vertices ordered by degree:
1. 1 (degree 1)
2. 6 (degree 1)
3. 7 (degree 1)
4. 9 (degree 1)
5. 0 (degree 2)
6. 3 (degree 2)
7. 4 (degree 2)
8. 5 (degree 2)
9. 2 (degree 3)
10. 8 (degree 4)
