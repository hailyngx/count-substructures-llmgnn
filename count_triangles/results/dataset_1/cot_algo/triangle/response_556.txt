Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we'll sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 3: 0 connections
Nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9: 1 connection
Nodes 4: 2 connections
Nodes 1, 6: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes according to their degree:
Node 3: 0
Nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Nodes 4: 7
Nodes 1, 6: 8, 9

Looking at the ordered edges with the lower label vertex having fewer connections:
(0, 1) forms triangle with node 6. - Triangle: <0, 1, 6>
(0, 6) forms triangle with node 1. - Triangle: <0, 6, 1>
(0, 8) and (8, 0) do not form triangles.
(1, 2) does not form a triangle.
(1, 5) does not form a triangle.
(1, 6) and (6, 1) do not form triangles.
(2, 1) does not form a triangle.
(4, 6) forms triangle with node 1. - Triangle: <4, 6, 1>
(4, 9) does not form a triangle.
(5, 1) does not form a triangle.
(6, 7) does not form a triangle.
(7, 6) does not form a triangle.

The total number of triangles is [3].
