Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:

Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections

Relabel the vertices accordingly:
5 -> 0
7 -> 1
9 -> 2
4 -> 3
2 -> 4
5 -> 5
7 -> 6
8 -> 7
6 -> 8
1 -> 9

Now, we will go through the edges based on the vertices with lower labels having fewer connections:

Checking (1, 6): Both have 4 and 5 connections respectively, skip.
Checking (1, 7): Both have 4 and 2 connections respectively, skip.
Checking (1, 8): 9 (5 connections) has fewer connections than 8 (3 connections), form triangle with shared connection (6).
Checking (1, 9): 9 (2 connections) has fewer connections than 1 (5 connections), form triangle with shared connection (6).
Checking (2, 3): Both have 2 connections, skip.
Checking (2, 4): Both have 2 connections, skip.
Checking (3, 2): Both have 2 connections, skip.
Checking (3, 5): 3 (2 connections) has fewer connections than 5 (2 connections), form triangle with shared connection (2).
Checking (4, 2): 4 (2 connections) has fewer connections than 2 (2 connections), form triangle with shared connection (3).
Checking (4, 6): 4 (2 connections) has fewer connections than 6 (4 connections), form triangle with shared connection (1).
Checking (6, 1): 1 (5 connections) has more connections than 6 (4 connections), skip.
Checking (6, 8): 6 (4 connections) has fewer connections than 8 (3 connections), form triangle with shared connection (1).
Checking (7, 1): Both have 1 connection, skip.
Checking (8, 1): 8 (3 connections) has fewer connections than 1 (5 connections), form triangle with shared connection (6).
Checking (8, 6): 8 (3 connections) has fewer connections than 6 (4 connections), form triangle with shared connection (1).
Checking (9, 1): 9 (2 connections) has fewer connections than 1 (5 connections), form triangle with shared connection (6).

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles:
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<4, 6, 8>
