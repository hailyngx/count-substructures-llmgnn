Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we will first sort the vertices based on their degree to apply the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following labeling:
Vertices: 3, 1, 5, 6, 2, 8, 7, 4, 9, 0

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <0, 2, 4>
2. Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <0, 4, 9>
5. Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle.
8. Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (5, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <5, 9, 4>
11. Edge (6, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <6, 9, 4>
12. Edge (7, 3) does not form a triangle.
13. Edge (8, 1) does not form a triangle.
14. Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.
15. Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
