Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph with 10 nodes is as follows:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check the edges according to the order of the nodes:

1. (0, 3): Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 7 <0, 2, 7>
2. (0, 6): No triangles formed
3. (0, 7): Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 3 <0, 2, 3>
4. (1, 3): No triangles formed
5. (1, 5): No triangles formed
6. (2, 3): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7 <0, 2, 7>
7. (2, 4): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5 <0, 2, 5>
8. (2, 7): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 3 <0, 2, 3>
9. (3, 0): Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 7 <0, 2, 7>
10. (3, 1): No triangles formed
11. (3, 2): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7 <0, 2, 7>
12. (4, 2): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5 <0, 2, 5>
13. (4, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 2 <0, 2, 5>
14. (4, 9): No triangles formed
15. (5, 1): No triangles formed
16. (5, 4): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 2 <0, 2, 5>
17. (5, 8): No triangles formed
18. (6, 0): No triangles formed
19. (6, 8): No triangles formed
20. (6, 9): No triangles formed
21. (7, 0): Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 3 <0, 2, 3>
22. (7, 2): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 3 <0, 2, 3>
23. (8, 5): No triangles formed
24. (8, 6): No triangles formed
25. (9, 4): No triangles formed
26. (9, 6): No triangles formed

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>
