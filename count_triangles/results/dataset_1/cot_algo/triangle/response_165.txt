Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method entails sorting the vertices based on their degrees, where the vertex with the least connections is assigned the smallest label. Here's the sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees:

Vertices: 
(3) - 3 connections
(8) - 1 connection
(7) - 2 connections
(9) - 3 connections
(2) - 3 connections
(5) - 3 connections
(4) - 6 connections
(6) - 4 connections
(1) - 6 connections
(0) - 6 connections

Based on the sorting, we can now go through each edge and count the triangles. 
There are 17 triangles in total. 

[17] 
Note: Unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 4>
<9, 6, 0>
<9, 6, 1>
