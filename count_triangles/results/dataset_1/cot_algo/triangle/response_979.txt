Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Number of triangles in the graph: [8]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 8, 7>, <4, 6, 9>
