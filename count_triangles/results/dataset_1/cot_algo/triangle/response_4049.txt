Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 0 has 2 connections
Node 2 has 3 connections
Node 4 has 2 connections
Node 6 has 2 connections
Node 8 has 1 connections
Node 9 has 4 connections
Node 1 has 7 connections
Node 7 has 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:
- Looking at the edge (0, 1): Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 1. Shared connections are 2 and 1.
- Looking at the edge (0, 2): Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 2. Shared connections are 2.
- Looking at the edge (1, 0): Node 1 has more connections than Node 0, so we skip.
- Looking at the edge (1, 2): Node 1 has more connections than Node 2, so we skip.
- Looking at the edge (1, 4): Node 1 has more connections than Node 4, so we skip.
- Looking at the edge (1, 6): Node 1 has more connections than Node 6, so we skip.
- Looking at the edge (1, 8): Node 1 has more connections than Node 8, so we skip.
- Looking at the edge (1, 9): Node 1 has more connections than Node 9, so we skip.
- Looking at the edge (2, 0): Node 2 has more connections than Node 0, so we skip.
- Looking at the edge (2, 1): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 1. Shared connections are 2.
- Looking at the edge (2, 7): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 7. Shared connections are 2.
- Looking at the edge (4, 1): Node 4 has fewer connections than Node 1. Shared connections are 9 and 1.
- Looking at the edge (4, 9): Node 4 has fewer connections than Node 9. Shared connections are 1 and 9.
- Looking at the edge (6, 1): Node 6 has fewer connections than Node 1. Shared connections are 7 and 1.
- Looking at the edge (6, 7): Node 6 has fewer connections than Node 7. Shared connections are 6 and 7.
- Looking at the edge (7, 2): Node 7 has more connections than Node 2, so we skip.
- Looking at the edge (7, 6): Node 7 has more connections than Node 6, so we skip.
- Looking at the edge (7, 9): Node 7 has more connections than Node 9, so we skip.
- Looking at the edge (8, 1): Node 8 has fewer connections than Node 1. Shared connections are 1.
- Looking at the edge (9, 1): Node 9 has more connections than Node 1, so we skip.
- Looking at the edge (9, 4): Node 9 has more connections than Node 4, so we skip.
- Looking at the edge (9, 7): Node 9 has more connections than Node 7, so we skip.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 1>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 8, 1>, <2, 7, 2>.
