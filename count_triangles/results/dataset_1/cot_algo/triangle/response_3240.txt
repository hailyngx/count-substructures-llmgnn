Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
0 (degree 3), 1 (degree 2), 3 (degree 2), 6 (degree 0), 7 (degree 3), 8 (degree 3), 2 (degree 4), 5 (degree 4), 4 (degree 4), 9 (degree 4)
