Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, we have the following new labels for the vertices:
- Node 1: 0 connections
- Node 5: 0 connections
- Node 7: 0 connections
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections
- Node 0: 6 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Node 1 (0 connections) doesn't form triangles with any other nodes.
- Node 5 (0 connections) doesn't form triangles with any other nodes.
- Node 7 (0 connections) doesn't form triangles with any other nodes.
- Node 4 (1 connection) doesn't form triangles with its only neighbor.
- Node 8 (3 connections) forms a triangle with Nodes 0, 6, and 9: <0, 6, 8>.
- Node 2 (4 connections) forms a triangle with Nodes 0 and 6: <0, 2, 6>.
- Node 3 (4 connections) doesn't form triangles with its neighbors.
- Node 6 (4 connections) forms a triangle with Nodes 0 and 9: <0, 6, 9>.
- Node 9 (5 connections) forms a triangle with Nodes 0 and 6: <0, 6, 9>.
- Node 0 (6 connections) doesn't form any additional triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, and <0, 6, 9>.
