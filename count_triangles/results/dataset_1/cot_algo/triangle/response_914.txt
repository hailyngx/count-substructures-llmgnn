Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Here are the vertices labeled according to their degree:

(0) - degree 2
(3) - degree 2
(8) - degree 2
(5) - degree 3
(7) - degree 3
(1) - degree 4
(6) - degree 4
(4) - degree 5
(2) - degree 6

Following the method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Now, we will count the triangles formed by the shared connections in these edges.

Triangles:
- <0, 2, 6>

[Total number of triangles: 1]
