Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:

1. Sort nodes by the number of connections they have in ascending order:
   Node 5 (degree 1)
   Node 1 (degree 2)
   Node 4 (degree 2)
   Node 0 (degree 2)
   Node 8 (degree 3)
   Node 7 (degree 3)
   Node 6 (degree 3)
   Node 3 (degree 4)
   Node 9 (degree 5)
   Node 2 (degree 6)

2. Relabel the nodes:
   Node 5 -> Node 0
   Node 1 -> Node 1
   Node 4 -> Node 2
   Node 0 -> Node 3
   Node 8 -> Node 4
   Node 7 -> Node 5
   Node 6 -> Node 6
   Node 3 -> Node 7
   Node 9 -> Node 8
   Node 2 -> Node 9

Now, we go through the edges and count the triangles formed by each unique triangle in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4> (formed by edges: (0, 2), (2, 8), (0, 8))
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5> (formed by edges: (0, 2), (2, 7), (5, 9))
3. Triangle <0, 2, 6> (formed by edges: (0, 2), (2, 7), (6, 7))
4. Triangle <1, 2, 3> (formed by edges: (1, 2), (2, 4), (1, 3))
5. Triangle <1, 2, 4> (formed by edges: (1, 2), (2, 4), (1, 3))
6. Triangle <1, 2, 6> (formed by edges: (1, 2), (2, 7), (6, 7))
7. Triangle <1, 3, 6> (formed by edges: (1, 3), (3, 6), (6, 7))
8. Triangle <2, 4, 9> (formed by edges: (2, 4), (4, 2), (2, 7))
9. Triangle <2, 7, 9> (formed by edges: (2, 8), (2, 7), (7, 8))
10. Triangle <3, 6, 9> (formed by edges: (3, 6), (6, 9), (3, 9))

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
