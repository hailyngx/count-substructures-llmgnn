Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each node has:
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we need to relabel the nodes based on the number of connections in ascending order:
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections

Next, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:
Triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
