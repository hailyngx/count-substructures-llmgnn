Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices' degrees:
0: 2
1: 1
2: 4
3: 1
4: 2
5: 3
6: 4
7: 1
8: 3
9: 7

Based on the degree-based ordering, we relabel the vertices as follows:
1 -> 0
7 -> 1
3 -> 2
8 -> 3
0 -> 4
4 -> 5
5 -> 6
2 -> 7
6 -> 8
9 -> 9

Now, we check the edges based on the relabeled vertices:

(4, 9): Forms a triangle with vertex 0, 5, and 7. <0, 5, 7>
(5, 9): Forms a triangle with vertex 6, 7, and 8. <6, 7, 8>
(6, 9): Forms a triangle with vertex 7, 8, and 9. <7, 8, 9>
(6, 8): Forms a triangle with vertex 6, 7, and 9. <6, 7, 9>
(2, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 2, 6, and 7. <2, 6, 7>
(2, 9): Forms a triangle with vertex 7, 8, and 9. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
