Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 4 with 0 connection
- Nodes 0 and 5 with 2 connections
- Nodes 1 and 3 with 3 connections
- Nodes 2 and 9 with 4 connections
- Nodes 6 and 8 with 5 connections
- Node 7 with 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 6, 1>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 3>
4. Triangle <0, 7, 2>
5. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
7. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
8. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
9. Triangle <5, 7, 9>
10. Triangle <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
