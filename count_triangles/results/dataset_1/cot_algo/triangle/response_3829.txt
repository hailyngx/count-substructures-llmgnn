Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied as follows:

Node Degrees:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 3

Sorted Nodes:
- Node 7: 1
- Node 0: 2
- Node 6: 3
- Node 1: 3
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 3
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 3
- Node 5: 4
- Node 2: 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will process the edges in the following order:
(7, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2)

Number of Triangles: [4]

Unique Triangles:
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
