Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertices: 
0 - 3 connections
1 - 3 connections
2 - 3 connections
3 - 2 connections
4 - 2 connections
5 - 2 connections
6 - 4 connections
7 - 4 connections
8 - 2 connections
9 - 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Edges to consider: (0, 2), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 6), (3, 5), (4, 7), (6, 5), (6, 7), (8, 1), (9, 4)
