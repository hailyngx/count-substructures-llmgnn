Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the new node order is: 

Nodes: 6, 8, 9, 2, 3, 5, 1, 4, 0

Now, we can identify the triangles in the graph based on the connections between nodes. The total number of triangles is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 4>
<4, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
