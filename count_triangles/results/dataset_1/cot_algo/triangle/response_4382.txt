Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method relies on sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then relabeling the vertices based on this sorting. 

In this case, the sorted list of vertices based on their connections is as follows:
Vertices: 6, 0, 5, 7, 1, 4, 9, 3, 8, 2

Using the connections given in the graph and the relabeled vertices, we can now count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between vertices with lower labels.

Based on this analysis, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>.
