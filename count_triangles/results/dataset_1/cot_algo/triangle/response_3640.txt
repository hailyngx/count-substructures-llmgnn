Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 5, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 6, 8, 0, 4

Now, we re-label the vertices accordingly:
5 -> 0
1 -> 1
2 -> 2
3 -> 3
7 -> 4
9 -> 5
6 -> 6
8 -> 7
0 -> 8
4 -> 9

Now, we go through each edge and check for triangles:
(0, 4) - Both have a higher label, so we skip.
(0, 8) - 0 has fewer connections than 8. Shared connection: 0-4-8, Triangle: <0, 4, 8>
(0, 9) - 0 has fewer connections than 9. Shared connection: 0-4-9, Triangle: <0, 4, 9>
(1, 4) - Both have a higher label, so we skip.
(2, 3) - Both have a higher label, so we skip.
(2, 6) - Both have a higher label, so we skip.
(2, 8) - 2 has fewer connections than 8. Shared connection: 2-0-8, Triangle: <2, 0, 8>
(3, 2) - 3 has fewer connections than 2. Shared connection: 3-0-2, Triangle: <3, 0, 2>
(3, 7) - Both have a higher label, so we skip.
(4, 0) - Both have a higher label, so we skip.
(4, 1) - 4 has fewer connections than 1. Shared connection: 4-0-1, Triangle: <4, 0, 1>
(4, 6) - 4 has fewer connections than 6. Shared connection: 4-0-6, Triangle: <4, 0, 6>
(4, 8) - 4 has fewer connections than 8. Shared connection: 4-0-8, Triangle: <4, 0, 8>
(5, 7) - Both have a higher label, so we skip.
(6, 2) - 6 has fewer connections than 2. Shared connection: 6-0-2, Triangle: <6, 0, 2>
(6, 4) - 6 has fewer connections than 4. Shared connection: 6-0-4, Triangle: <6, 0, 4>
(6, 8) - 6 has fewer connections than 8. Shared connection: 6-0-8, Triangle: <6, 0, 8>
(6, 9) - 6 has fewer connections than 9. Shared connection: 6-4-9, Triangle: <6, 4, 9>
(7, 3) - 7 has fewer connections than 3. Shared connection: 7-0-3, Triangle: <7, 0, 3>
(7, 5) - Both have a higher label, so we skip.
(7, 9) - 7 has fewer connections than 9. Shared connection: 7-4-9, Triangle: <7, 4, 9>
(8, 0) - Both have a higher label, so we skip.
(8, 2) - Both have a higher label, so we skip.
(8, 4) - 8 has fewer connections than 4. Shared connection: 8-0-4, Triangle: <8, 0, 4>
(8, 6) - 8 has fewer connections than 6. Shared connection: 8-0-6, Triangle: <8, 0, 6>
(9, 0) - 9 has fewer connections than 0. Shared connection: 9-4-0, Triangle: <9, 4, 0>
(9, 6) - 9 has fewer connections than 6. Shared connection: 9-4-6, Triangle: <9, 4, 6>
(9, 7) - 9 has fewer connections than 7. Shared connection: 9-4-7, Triangle: <9, 4, 7>

Total number of triangles: [10]
Triangles: <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 0, 8>, <3, 0, 2>, <4, 0, 1>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 0, 8>, <6, 0, 2>, <6, 0, 4>, <6, 0, 8>, <6, 4, 9>, <7, 0, 3>, <7, 4, 9>, <8, 0, 4>, <8, 0, 6>, <9, 4, 0>, <9, 4, 6>, <9, 4, 7>
