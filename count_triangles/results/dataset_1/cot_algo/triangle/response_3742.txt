Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

0 -> 2 connections
1 -> 4 connections
5 -> 1 connection
9 -> 2 connections
3 -> 3 connections
6 -> 4 connections
7 -> 4 connections
8 -> 3 connections
4 -> 5 connections
2 -> 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Calculating the triangles based on the shared connections:
- Triangle <0, 2, 1> with shared connections: 0-2-1
- Triangle <0, 2, 6> with shared connections: 0-2-6
- Triangle <0, 2, 9> with shared connections: 0-2-9
- Triangle <2, 1, 4> with shared connections: 2-1-4
- Triangle <6, 0, 3> with shared connections: 6-0-3
- Triangle <6, 0, 4> with shared connections: 6-0-4
- Triangle <6, 4, 7> with shared connections: 6-4-7
- Triangle <6, 3, 4> with shared connections: 6-3-4
- Triangle <6, 3, 7> with shared connections: 6-3-7
- Triangle <6, 4, 8> with shared connections: 6-4-8
- Triangle <6, 7, 4> with shared connections: 6-7-4
- Triangle <6, 7, 8> with shared connections: 6-7-8
- Triangle <7, 1, 4> with shared connections: 7-1-4
- Triangle <7, 4, 8> with shared connections: 7-4-8

Therefore, there are a total of [14] triangles in the given graph.
