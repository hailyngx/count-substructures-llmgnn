Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
- Node 5 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 1 and 7 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 3, 6, and 8 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 0 and 5 have 4 connections each.
- Node 9 has 5 connections.
- Node 2 has 6 connections.

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 5 (1 connection) becomes Node 1.
- Nodes 1 and 7 (2 connections) become Nodes 2 and 3.
- Nodes 3, 6, and 8 (3 connections) become Nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Nodes 0 and 5 (4 connections) become Nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 9 (5 connections) becomes Node 9.
- Node 2 (6 connections) becomes Node 10.

Next, we will visit each edge and count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- (0, 2): Shared connection with 4, so triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- (0, 3): No triangles.
- (0, 4): No triangles.
- (1, 8): No triangles.
- (1, 9): No triangles.
- (2, 4): No triangles.
- (2, 5): No triangles.
- (2, 6): No triangles.
- (2, 7): Shared connection with 0, so triangle <0, 2, 7>.
- (3, 6): No triangles.
- (4, 9): No triangles.
- (5, 2): No triangles.
- (6, 3): No triangles.
- (7, 9): No triangles.
- (8, 9): No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>.
