Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 7: 0 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 5: 0 connections      -> Vertex 0
Vertex 7: 0 connections      -> Vertex 1
Vertex 6: 1 connection       -> Vertex 2
Vertex 1: 2 connections      -> Vertex 3
Vertex 4: 2 connections      -> Vertex 4
Vertex 8: 2 connections      -> Vertex 5
Vertex 0: 4 connections      -> Vertex 6
Vertex 3: 4 connections      -> Vertex 7
Vertex 9: 4 connections      -> Vertex 8
Vertex 2: 5 connections      -> Vertex 9

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

<2, 3, 7>
<2, 9, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 0, 9>
<4, 9, 8>
<6, 0, 7>
<6, 2, 9>
<0, 2, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
