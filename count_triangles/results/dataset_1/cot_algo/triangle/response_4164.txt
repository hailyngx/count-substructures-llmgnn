Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 1 (degree 2)
Node 5 (degree 3)
Node 8 (degree 3)
Node 2 (degree 4)
Node 4 (degree 4)
Node 7 (degree 5)
Node 0 (degree 6)
Node 3 (degree 6)
Node 6 (degree 6)
Node 9 (degree 6)

Analyzing the edges based on the degree-based ordering, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle <5, 6, 9>
- Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
