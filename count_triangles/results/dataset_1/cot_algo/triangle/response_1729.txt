Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Node 0 has 1 connection  
Node 3 has 1 connection  
Node 5 has 1 connection  
Node 7 has 2 connections  
Node 9 has 2 connections  
Node 1 has 8 connections  
Node 2 has 4 connections  
Node 4 has 5 connections  
Node 6 has 4 connections  
Node 8 has 4 connections  

Now, we will go through each edge to count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle <1, 2, 7>.
- Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle <1, 4, 6>.
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle <1, 6, 4>.
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle <1, 7, 2>.
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 7) forms a triangle <2, 7, 1>.
- Edge (4, 6) forms a triangle <4, 6, 1>.
- Edge (4, 8) forms a triangle <4, 8, 6>.
- Edge (6, 8) forms a triangle <6, 8, 4>.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
