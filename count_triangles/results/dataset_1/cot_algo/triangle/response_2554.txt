Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: <7, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 9>.

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

- Edge (0, 4): Shared connections with 6. Triangle <0, 4, 6>.
- Edge (0, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 4): Shared connections with 6. Triangle <1, 4, 6>.
- Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 4): Shared connections with 6. Triangle <3, 4, 6>.
- Edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 0): Shared connections with 6. Triangle <0, 4, 6>.
- Edge (4, 1): Shared connections with 6. Triangle <1, 4, 6>.
- Edge (4, 3): Shared connections with 6. Triangle <3, 4, 6>.
- Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 4): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 0): Shared connections with 4. Triangle <0, 4, 6>.
- Edge (6, 1): Shared connections with 4. Triangle <1, 4, 6>.
- Edge (6, 3): Shared connections with 4. Triangle <3, 4, 6>.
- Edge (6, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 4): Shared connections with 6. Triangle <4, 6, 8>.
- Edge (8, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 5): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 8>.
