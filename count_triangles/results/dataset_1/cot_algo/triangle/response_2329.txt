Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to Node 1 and Node 1 is connected to Node 3, forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.
2. Node 0 is connected to Node 1 and Node 1 is connected to Node 6, forming a triangle <0, 1, 6>.
3. Node 1 is connected to Node 3 and Node 3 is connected to Node 6, forming a triangle <1, 3, 6>.
4. Node 3 is connected to Node 2 and Node 2 is connected to Node 8, forming a triangle <2, 3, 8>.
5. Node 3 is connected to Node 8 and Node 8 is connected to Node 5, forming a triangle <3, 5, 8>.
6. Node 3 is connected to Node 6 and Node 6 is connected to Node 7, forming a triangle <3, 6, 7>.
7. Node 3 is connected to Node 7 and Node 7 is connected to Node 9, forming a triangle <3, 7, 9>.
8. Node 6 is connected to Node 1 and Node 1 is connected to Node 3, forming a triangle <1, 3, 6>.
9. Node 6 is connected to Node 3 and Node 3 is connected to Node 7, forming a triangle <3, 6, 7>.
10. Node 7 is connected to Node 3 and Node 3 is connected to Node 8, forming a triangle <3, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
