Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
1. 7 (degree: 2)
2. 1 (degree: 3)
3. 2 (degree: 3)
4. 6 (degree: 3)
5. 5 (degree: 4)
6. 4 (degree: 5)
7. 0 (degree: 5)
8. 3 (degree: 5)
9. 8 (degree: 6)

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on this ordering:  
- 7 -> 0
- 1 -> 1
- 2 -> 2
- 6 -> 3
- 5 -> 4
- 4 -> 5
- 0 -> 6
- 3 -> 7
- 8 -> 8

After relabeling, the edges are:  
(6, 5) (6, 0) (6, 8)  
(1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4)  
(2, 1) (2, 5)  
(3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8)  
(4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5)  
(5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7)  
(0, 6)  
(7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8)  
(8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7)  

Now, we will find the triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge:
- Triangles:  
   1. <2, 4, 5>  
   2. <1, 4, 5>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
