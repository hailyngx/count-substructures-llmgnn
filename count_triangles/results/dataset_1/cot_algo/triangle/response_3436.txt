Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the graph:

Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 1 connection.

Relabeling the nodes from least to most connections:
Node 9 → 0 (1 connection)
Node 3 → 1 (2 connections)
Node 1 → 2 (2 connections)
Node 0 → 3 (3 connections)

Proceeding with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Checking edge (0, 2): 0 and 2 are connected via 4 and 7 which forms a triangle.
Checking edge (0, 4): 0 and 4 are connected via 5 which forms a triangle.
Checking edge (0, 7): 0 and 7 are connected via 5 which forms a triangle.
Checking edge (1, 3): 1 and 3 are not directly connected.
Checking edge (1, 6): 1 and 6 are connected via 5 which forms a triangle.
Checking edge (2, 8): 2 and 8 are connected via 5 which forms a triangle.
Checking edge (2, 9): 2 and 9 are not directly connected.

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
