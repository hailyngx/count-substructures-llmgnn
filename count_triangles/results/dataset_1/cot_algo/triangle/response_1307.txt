Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their corresponding number of connections:

Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Check the edge (0, 2) - Proceed
   Vertices 0 and 2 have no shared connections.

2. Check the edge (0, 7) - Proceed
   Vertices 0 and 7 have 1 shared connection: Vertex 5.
   Triangle: <0, 5, 7>

3. Check the edge (0, 9) - Proceed
   Vertices 0 and 9 have no shared connections.

4. Check the edge (1, 3) - Skip as Vertex 1 has fewer connections.

5. Check the edge (1, 4) - Proceed
   Vertices 1 and 4 have no shared connections.

6. Check the edge (2, 0) - Skip as Vertex 0 has more connections.

7. Check the edge (3, 1) - Skip as Vertex 1 has fewer connections.

8. Check the edge (3, 8) - Skip as Vertex 3 has fewer connections.

9. Check the edge (4, 1) - Skip as Vertex 1 has fewer connections.

10. Check the edge (4, 5) - Proceed
    Vertices 4 and 5 have 1 shared connection: Vertex 8.
    Triangle: <4, 5, 8>

11. Continue checking the remaining edges similarly.

After counting all triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
