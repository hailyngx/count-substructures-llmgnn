Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 0: 0 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can determine the triangles formed:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <1, 4, 7>
5. <1, 5, 7>
6. <1, 7, 9>
7. <2, 3, 7>
8. <2, 7, 4>
9. <3, 5, 7>
10. <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
