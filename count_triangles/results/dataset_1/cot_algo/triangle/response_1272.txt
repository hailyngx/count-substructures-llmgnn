Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then relabeling them accordingly. 

Here are the vertices listed in order of least connections to most connections:

Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections

Now, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles based on the method mentioned earlier:

Triangles:
[8]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 8>.
