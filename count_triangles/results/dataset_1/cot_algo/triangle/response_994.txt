Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are: 

Node 3 with degree 2
Node 1 with degree 2
Node 4 with degree 2
Node 7 with degree 3
Node 0 with degree 4
Node 9 with degree 4
Node 5 with degree 4
Node 8 with degree 5
Node 6 with degree 6
Node 2 with degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles:

- For edge (0, 2): Check shared connections and find the triangle <0, 2, 6>.
- For edge (0, 5): Check shared connections and find the triangle <0, 5, 9>.
- For edge (0, 6): Check shared connections and find the triangle <0, 6, 2>.
- For edge (0, 7): No triangles formed.
- For edge (1, 6): No triangles formed.
- For edge (2, 6): Check shared connections and find the triangle <2, 6, 0>.
- For edge (2, 8): Check shared connections and find the triangle <2, 8, 4>.
- For edge (2, 9): Check shared connections and find the triangle <2, 9, 6>.
- For edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
- For edge (3, 8): No triangles formed.
- For edge (4, 6): Check shared connections and find the triangle <4, 6, 8>.
- For edge (4, 8): Check shared connections and find the triangle <4, 8, 2>.
- For edge (5, 0): Check shared connections and find the triangle <5, 0, 6>.
- For edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.
- For edge (5, 8): Check shared connections and find the triangle <5, 8, 2>.
- For edge (5, 9): Check shared connections and find the triangle <5, 9, 2>.
- For edge (6, 0): Check shared connections and find the triangle <6, 0, 2>.
- For edge (6, 1): No triangles formed.
- For edge (6, 2): Check shared connections and find the triangle <6, 2, 0>.
- For edge (6, 4): Check shared connections and find the triangle <6, 4, 8>.
- For edge (6, 9): Check shared connections and find the triangle <6, 9, 2>.
- For edge (7, 0): No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.
- For edge (8, 2): Check shared connections and find the triangle <8, 2, 6>.
- For edge (8, 3): No triangles formed.
- For edge (8, 4): Check shared connections and find the triangle <8, 4, 6>.
- For edge (8, 5): Check shared connections and find the triangle <8, 5, 0>.
- For edge (8, 7): No triangles formed.
- For edge (9, 2): Check shared connections and find the triangle <9, 2, 6>.
- For edge (9, 5): Check shared connections and find the triangle <9, 5, 0>.
- For edge (9, 6): Check shared connections and find the triangle <9, 6, 2>.
- For edge (9, 7): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15], and the unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 8, 4>, <2, 9, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 8, 2>, <5, 8, 2>, <5, 9, 2>, <6, 0, 2>, <6, 2, 0>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 9, 2>, <8, 2, 6>, <8, 4, 6>, <8, 5, 0>.
