Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 0 is connected to: [8, 9]. Degree: 2  
Vertex 1 is connected to: [3, 8]. Degree: 2  
Vertex 2 is connected to: [6, 7]. Degree: 2  
Vertex 3 is connected to: [1, 4, 8, 9]. Degree: 4  
Vertex 4 is connected to: [3, 7, 9]. Degree: 3  
Vertex 5 is connected to: [7, 8]. Degree: 2  
Vertex 6 is connected to: [2]. Degree: 1  
Vertex 7 is connected to: [2, 4, 5, 8]. Degree: 4  
Vertex 8 is connected to: [0, 1, 3, 5, 7]. Degree: 5  
Vertex 9 is connected to: [0, 3, 4]. Degree: 3  

Following the degree-based ordering method on the provided edges, checking the shared connections for each edge:
- (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
- (2, 7) forms triangles with (2, 6) and (6, 7).
- (4, 7) forms a triangle with (3, 4).
- (5, 7) forms a triangle with (3, 4) and (4, 7).
- (0, 8) forms a triangle with (3, 8).
- (0, 9) does not form a triangle.
- (3, 9) forms a triangle with (0, 9).
- (7, 8) forms triangles with (3, 8), (5, 8), and (8, 0).
- (1, 8) forms a triangle with (0, 8).

Count of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 8, 0>, <3, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 1>, <2, 6, 7>, <0, 9, 3>, <5, 7, 8>.
