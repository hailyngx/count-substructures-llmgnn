Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to create a table to keep track of the degrees of each node:
Node | Degree
1    | 3
3    | 1
4    | 3
5    | 4
6    | 3
7    | 2
8    | 1
9    | 4

Next, we need to relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node | Degree | New Label
1    | 3      | 1
3    | 1      | 2
4    | 3      | 3
5    | 4      | 4
6    | 3      | 5
7    | 2      | 6
8    | 1      | 7
9    | 4      | 8

By only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we analyze the following edges:
(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 6), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 9)

Now, we count the triangles formed by shared connections:
- <1, 4, 5>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 9>

Hence, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
