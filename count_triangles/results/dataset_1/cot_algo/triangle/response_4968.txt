Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Initially, let's determine the degree of each node:

- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 2 (1 connection)
- Node 3 (2 connections)
- Node 5 (2 connections)
- Node 8 (2 connections)
- Node 0 (3 connections)
- Node 4 (3 connections)
- Node 9 (4 connections)
- Node 1 (5 connections)
- Node 6 (5 connections)
- Node 7 (5 connections)

Next, we will analyze the edges based on the relabeled nodes:

1. Edge between Node 0 and Node 1: Both have different degrees, so we proceed.
   - Shared connections: Node 1 has connections with Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9. 
      - There is a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
      - There is a triangle <0, 1, 6>.
2. Edge between Node 0 and Node 5: Both have different degrees, so we proceed.
   - Shared connection: Node 0 has connections with Node 1.
      - There is a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
3. Edge between Node 0 and Node 8: Both have different degrees, so we proceed.
   - No shared connections, move to the next edge.
4. Edge between Node 1 and Node 4: Both have the same degree, so we skip this edge.
5. Edge between Node 1 and Node 6: Both have the same degree, so we skip this edge.
6. Edge between Node 1 and Node 7: Both have the same degree, so we skip this edge.
7. Edge between Node 1 and Node 9: Both have the same degree, so we skip this edge.
8. Edge between Node 2 and Node 7: Both have different degrees, so we proceed.
   - No shared connections, move to the next edge.
9. Edge between Node 3 and Node 7: Both have different degrees, so we proceed.
   - No shared connections, move to the next edge.
(Continuing to analyze all edges in a similar manner...)

The total number of triangles found in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, and <2, 7, 3>.
