Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
By reordering the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
(3, 7, 9, 1, 5, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4)

Examining each edge with consideration to the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
