Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by number of connections:
Vertex 4: 0 connections
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 6 connections
