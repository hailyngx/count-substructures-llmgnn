Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 5 - Degree: 0
Node 4 - Degree: 1
Node 9 - Degree: 1
Node 3 - Degree: 1
Node 2 - Degree: 1
Node 7 - Degree: 2
Node 6 - Degree: 4
Node 1 - Degree: 4
Node 8 - Degree: 4
Node 0 - Degree: 6

Based on the degree-based ordering, we can analyze the edges to count the triangles:
1. For edge (0, 3): Both nodes 0 and 3 have lower degrees, so we proceed to check for triangles. Node 0 and node 3 share node 6, forming a triangle <0, 3, 6>.
2. For edge (0, 6): Node 0 has a lower degree than node 6, so we proceed to check for triangles. Node 0 and node 6 share nodes 1, 4, and 7, forming three triangles: <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 7>.
3. For edge (0, 7): Node 0 has a lower degree than node 7, so we proceed to check for triangles. Node 0 and node 7 share node 8, forming a triangle <0, 7, 8>.
4. For edge (1, 6): Both nodes 1 and 6 have lower degrees, so we proceed to check for triangles. Node 1 and node 6 share node 0, forming a triangle <1, 6, 0>.
5. For edge (1, 8): Node 1 has a lower degree than node 8, so we proceed to check for triangles. Node 1 and node 8 share node 6, forming a triangle <1, 8, 6>.
6. For edge (1, 9): Both nodes 1 and 9 have lower degrees, so we proceed to check for triangles. Node 1 and node 9 share no common nodes, so no triangle is formed.
7. For edge (2, 8): Both nodes 2 and 8 have lower degrees, so we proceed to check for triangles. Node 2 and node 8 share no common nodes, so no triangle is formed.
8. For edge (3, 0): Since we already processed edge (0, 3), we skip this edge.
9. For edge (4, 6): Both nodes 4 and 6 have lower degrees, so we proceed to check for triangles. Node 4 and node 6 share node 0, forming a triangle <4, 6, 0>.
10. For the remaining edges, the node with the lower degree already had an edge processed, so we skip them.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 8, 6>
