Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Nodes: 4, 1, 0, 2, 5, 3, 6, 8, 9, 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles by examining the edges and checking for shared connections.

The total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <3, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.
