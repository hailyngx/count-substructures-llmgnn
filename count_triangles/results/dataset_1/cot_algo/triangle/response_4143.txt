Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degrees of each vertex. The degrees of the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 0: 3
- Vertex 1: 2
- Vertex 2: 1
- Vertex 3: 3
- Vertex 4: 4
- Vertex 5: 4
- Vertex 6: 2
- Vertex 7: 3
- Vertex 8: 4
- Vertex 9: 1

Now, we will perform the Degree-Based Ordering method by relabeling the vertices:
- Vertex 2 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 9 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 6 (Degree 2) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 1 (Degree 2) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 4 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 5 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 7 (Degree 3) -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 0 (Degree 3) -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 3 (Degree 3) -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 8 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will list the edges in the order of the labels:
(0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) 

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. Triangle: <0, 2, 8>
2. Triangle: <0, 7, 1>
3. Triangle: <0, 7, 5>
4. Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
5. Triangle: <2, 8, 4>
6. Triangle: <3, 4, 5>
7. Triangle: <5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
