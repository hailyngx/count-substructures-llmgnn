Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are:  

Vertices with 1 connection: 1, 2, 5, 7  
Vertices with 2 connections: 0, 9  
Vertices with 3 connections: 8  
Vertices with 4 connections: 3  
Vertices with 5 connections: 4, 6  

Now, we will count the triangles:

For edge (0, 4):  
- Vertex 0 has 1 connection (least), vertex 4 has 5 connections.  
- Shared connections are 9.  
- There is 1 triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>.

For edge (1, 6):  
- Vertex 1 has 1 connection, vertex 6 has 5 connections.  
- Shared connections are none.  
- No triangles formed.

For edge (2, 3):  
- Vertex 2 has 1 connection, vertex 3 has 4 connections.  
- Shared connections are none.  
- No triangles formed.

For edge (3, 6):  
- Vertex 3 has 4 connections, vertex 6 has 5 connections.  
- Shared connections are 9.  
- There is 1 triangle formed: <3, 6, 9>.

For edge (3, 9):  
- Vertex 3 has 4 connections, vertex 9 has 4 connections.  
- Shared connections are 6.  
- There is 1 triangle formed: <3, 6, 9>.

For edge (4, 7):  
- Vertex 4 has 5 connections, vertex 7 has 2 connections.  
- Shared connections are none.  
- No triangles formed.

For edge (4, 9):  
- Vertex 4 has 5 connections, vertex 9 has 4 connections.  
- Shared connections are 3.  
- There is 1 triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>.

For edge (5, 6):  
- Vertex 5 has 1 connection, vertex 6 has 5 connections.  
- Shared connections are 9.  
- There is 1 triangle formed: <5, 6, 9>.

For edge (6, 7):  
- Vertex 6 has 5 connections, vertex 7 has 2 connections.  
- Shared connections are none.  
- No triangles formed.

For edge (9, 6):  
- Vertex 9 has 4 connections, vertex 6 has 5 connections.  
- Shared connections are 3.  
- There is 1 triangle formed: <3, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, and <5, 6, 9>.
