Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method allows us to efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows:
Node 6: 0 connections.
Nodes 2 and 4: 1 connection.
Nodes 1, 8, 9: 2 connections.
Nodes 3 and 5: 3 connections.
Node 0: 5 connections.
Node 7: 6 connections.

Now, we will check each edge to count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 1): Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8. Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 3, and 4. They share a connection with node 3, forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- Edge (0, 3): Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8. Node 3 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 9. They share a connection with node 1, forming a triangle <0, 3, 1>.
- Edge (0, 5): Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8. Node 5 has connections with nodes 0 and 9. They share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <0, 5, 9>.
- Edge (0, 7): Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8. Node 7 has connections with nodes 0 and 9. They share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <0, 7, 9>.
- Edge (0, 8): Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8. Node 8 has connections with nodes 0 and 2. They share a connection with node 2, forming a triangle <0, 8, 2>.
- Edge (1, 3): Already counted above.
- Edge (1, 4): Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 3, and 4. Node 4 has connections with nodes 1 and 9. They share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <1, 4, 9>.
- Edge (4, 9): Already counted above.
- Edge (5, 9): Already counted above.
- Edge (7, 9): Already counted above.
- Edge (8, 2): Already counted above.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
