Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 7 has degree 1
Vertices 1, 2, 8 have degree 1
Vertices 5, 7 have degree 2
Vertices 6, 9 have degree 4
Vertices 0, 4 have degree 5
Vertex 3 has degree 6

Now, we relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 7 (degree 1) -> Vertex 0
Vertices 1, 2, 8 (degree 1) -> Vertices 1, 2, 3
Vertices 5, 7 (degree 2) -> Vertices 4, 5
Vertices 6, 9 (degree 4) -> Vertices 6, 7
Vertices 0, 4 (degree 5) -> Vertices 8, 9
Vertex 3 (degree 6) -> Vertex 10

Based on this relabeling, the new graph with relabeled vertices and its edges is as follows:
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 5), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Now, we count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 3]
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
