Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 4 (Degree 2)
- Node 5 (Degree 2)
- Node 6 (Degree 2)
- Node 1 (Degree 2)
- Node 3 (Degree 3)
- Node 2 (Degree 3)
- Node 7 (Degree 3)
- Node 0 (Degree 5)
- Node 8 (Degree 6)
- Node 9 (Degree 4)

By analyzing each edge while considering the degree-based ordering, we can count the triangles that form in the graph. 

We find that the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 7, 3>
<8, 9, 4>
