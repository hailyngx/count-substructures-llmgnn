Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertices 4 and 7: 1 connection
Vertices 2, 3, and 8: 2 connections
Vertices 1 and 6: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections

Relabeling the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 5 (0 connections) -> 0
Vertices 4 and 7 -> 1 and 2
Vertices 2, 3, and 8 -> 3, 4, and 5
Vertices 1 and 6 -> 6 and 7
Vertex 0 -> 8
Vertex 9 -> 9

Now, going through each edge, we will check for triangles:

- Edge (4, 6): No triangles
- Edge (6, 9): Triangle formed: <6, 8, 9>
- Edge (0, 6): No triangles
- Edge (1, 2): No triangles
- Edge (1, 3): No triangles
- Edge (1, 9): No triangles
- Edge (3, 1): No triangles
- Edge (3, 8): Triangle formed: <3, 5, 8>
- Edge (8, 9): Triangle formed: <5, 8, 9>
  
Output:
There are [3] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are <6, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 8>.
