Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Then we will relabel the vertices accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their number of connections: 
(1) - Vertex 1 (connected to nodes 3 and 5)
(3) - Vertex 4 (connected to nodes 9)
(3) - Vertex 6 (connected to nodes 2 and 8)
(3) - Vertex 7 (connected to none)
(4) - Vertex 0 (connected to nodes 3, 5)
(4) - Vertex 9 (connected to nodes 4, 8)
(5) - Vertex 2 (connected to nodes 6, 8)
(5) - Vertex 5 (connected to node 0)
(5) - Vertex 8 (connected to nodes 2, 9)
(5) - Vertex 3 (connected to node 0)

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
1. Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle with node 5. Triangle: <0, 3, 5>
2. Edge (0, 5): Forms a triangle with node 3. Triangle: <0, 5, 3>
3. Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (2, 8): Forms a triangle with node 9. Triangle: <2, 8, 9>
5. Edge (3, 0): Skip as the lower labeled vertex already processed.
6. Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (5, 0): Skip as the lower labeled vertex already processed.
8. Edge (6, 2): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (8, 2): Skip as the lower labeled vertex already processed.
10. Edge (8, 9): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (9, 8): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the triangles found are <0, 3, 5> and <2, 8, 9>.
