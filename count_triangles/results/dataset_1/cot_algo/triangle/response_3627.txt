Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each node:

- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 2 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 2

Now, we sort the nodes based on their degrees:

1. Node 1 and Node 2: Degree 1
2. Node 0, Node 3, and Node 9: Degree 2
3. Node 7: Degree 3
4. Node 8: Degree 4
5. Node 4: Degree 5

Next, we label the nodes accordingly:

- Node 1 and Node 2: Label 1
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 9: Label 2
- Node 7: Label 3
- Node 8: Label 4
- Node 4: Label 5

Now, we check the edges, keeping in mind only to proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- (1, 4): Node 1 and Node 4 share Node 2 forming the triangle <1, 2, 4>

Finally, we output the total number of triangles and the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 4>
