Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have the following new labels for the nodes:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 0
- Node 9: degree 0
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. Consider edge (0, 3): As 0 < 3 and both share a connection with node 2, a triangle is formed: <0, 2, 3>.
2. Consider edge (1, 6): As 1 < 6 and both share a connection with node 4, a triangle is formed: <1, 4, 6>.
3. Consider edge (1, 8): As 1 < 8 and both share a connection with node 6, a triangle is formed: <1, 6, 8>.
4. Consider edge (2, 3): As 2 < 3 and both share a connection with node 4, a triangle is formed: <2, 3, 4>.
5. Consider edge (2, 4): As 2 < 4 and both share a connection with node 3, a triangle is formed: <2, 3, 4>.

The total number of triangles is [5].
