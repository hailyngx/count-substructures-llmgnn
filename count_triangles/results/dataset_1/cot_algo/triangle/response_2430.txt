Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 2: 0 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph.
Starting with edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 3): Node 3 and Node 0 share a connection with Node 4, forming the triangle <0, 3, 4>.
- Edge (0, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 9): Node 9 shares connections with Node 2 and Node 0, forming triangles <4, 9, 0> and <4, 9, 2>.
- Edge (5, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed.

Count of triangles inside brackets []: [2]
Unique triangles found inside <>: <0, 3, 4>, <4, 9, 0>, <4, 9, 2>
