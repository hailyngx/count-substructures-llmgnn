Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 0: degree = 2
- Vertex 1: degree = 2
- Vertex 2: degree = 1
- Vertex 3: degree = 3
- Vertex 4: degree = 3
- Vertex 5: degree = 1
- Vertex 6: degree = 4
- Vertex 7: degree = 2
- Vertex 8: degree = 2
- Vertex 9: degree = 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Vertex 2: new label = 0
- Vertex 5: new label = 1
- Vertex 0: new label = 2
- Vertex 1: new label = 3
- Vertex 7: new label = 4
- Vertex 8: new label = 5
- Vertex 9: new label = 6
- Vertex 4: new label = 7
- Vertex 3: new label = 8
- Vertex 6: new label = 9

After relabeling, the edges in the graph become: (2, 7) (5, 4) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1)

Now, let's find the triangles: 
- Triangle <1, 3, 9>

Finally, we found 1 triangle in the graph, so the answer is:
[1]
