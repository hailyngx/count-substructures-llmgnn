Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:

0 - 6 connections
3 - 5 connections
1 - 2 connections
2 - 2 connections
4 - 2 connections
5 - 2 connections
6 - 2 connections
9 - 2 connections
7 - 1 connection
8 - 1 connection

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check each edge while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Counting the triangles by checking for shared connections along each edge, we find the following triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 2>.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
