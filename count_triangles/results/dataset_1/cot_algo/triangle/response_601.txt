Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the instructions for the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0: 1
1: 2
6: 1
9: 2
7: 2
3: 3
4: 4
8: 4
5: 5
2: 6

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on the ordering:
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
6 -> 2
9 -> 3
7 -> 4
3 -> 5
4 -> 6
8 -> 7
5 -> 8
2 -> 9

Now we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
Triangles: [28]

<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 9, 3>
<4, 9, 7>
<5, 9, 8>
<7, 9, 4>
