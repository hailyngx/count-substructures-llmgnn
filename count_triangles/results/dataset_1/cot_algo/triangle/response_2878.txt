Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections. Then, we will label the vertices accordingly:

Node 3: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections

We will now calculate the triangles in the graph:
- Checking edge (0, 4): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (0, 8): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (0, 9): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (1, 6): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (2, 4): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (2, 8): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (4, 0): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (4, 2): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (4, 6): Triangle found! (2, 4, 6)
- Checking edge (4, 8): Triangle found! (4, 6, 8)
- Checking edge (5, 6): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (5, 8): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (6, 1): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (6, 4): Triangle found! (2, 4, 6)
- Checking edge (6, 5): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (6, 9): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (8, 0): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (8, 2): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (8, 4): Triangle found! (4, 6, 8)
- Checking edge (8, 5): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (9, 0): no triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (9, 6): no triangles can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [3]
The unique triangles found are: <2, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 8>
