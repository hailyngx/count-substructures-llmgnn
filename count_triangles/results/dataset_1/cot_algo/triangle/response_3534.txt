Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of the nodes is as follows:
```
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 9: 7 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles by following the given edges:

1. Edge (0, 2) - Not counted since both nodes have the same degree.
2. Edge (0, 3) - Not counted since both nodes have the same degree.
3. Edge (0, 5) - Not counted since both nodes have the same degree.
4. Edge (0, 8) - Not counted since both nodes have the same degree.
5. Edge (0, 9) - Not counted since both nodes have the same degree.
6. Edge (1, 7) - Not counted since both nodes have the same degree.
7. Edge (1, 9) - Not counted since both nodes have the same degree.
8. Edge (2, 0) - Not counted since node 2 has a higher degree than node 0.
9. Edge (2, 5) - Not counted since node 2 has a higher degree than node 5.
10. Edge (2, 6) - Counted as a triangle: <0, 2, 6>.
11. Edge (2, 8) - Not counted since node 2 has a higher degree than node 8.
12. Edge (3, 0) - Not counted since node 3 has a higher degree than node 0.
