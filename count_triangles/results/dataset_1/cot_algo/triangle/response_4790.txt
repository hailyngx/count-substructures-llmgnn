Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is: 
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 0: Degree 7

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 1), (4, 0), (2, 0), (6, 2), (7, 0), (8, 4), (1, 3), (5, 3), (8, 5), (7, 5), (1, 5), (7, 8), (5, 8), (0, 2), (3, 6), (1, 7), (8, 7), (0, 9), (1, 9)

Following this order and counting the triangles, we find the total number of triangles to be [2].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
