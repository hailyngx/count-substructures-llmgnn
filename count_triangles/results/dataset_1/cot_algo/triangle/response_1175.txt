Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 4: 0 connections
Nodes 1 and 7: 1 connection
Nodes 3 and 8: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Nodes 2 and 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge starting with the edge between the vertices with the lower label:

1. Edge (0, 5) - Node 0 has 3 connections and Node 5 has 4 connections. Since Node 0 has fewer connections, we consider this edge:
   - Shared neighbor: Node 9
   - Triangle: <0, 5, 9>

2. Edge (0, 9) - Node 0 has 3 connections and Node 9 has 6 connections. We do not proceed with this edge.

3. Edge (1, 9) - Node 1 has 1 connection and Node 9 has 6 connections. We consider this edge:
   - Shared neighbor: None (No triangle)

4. Edge (2, 5) - Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 5 has 4 connections. We consider this edge:
   - Shared neighbor: Node 0
   - Triangle: <0, 2, 5>

5. Edge (2, 6) - Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 6 has 5 connections. Since Node 2 has fewer connections, we consider this edge:
   - Shared neighbor: None (No triangle)

6. Edge (2, 7) - Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 7 has 1 connection. We consider this edge:
   - Shared neighbor: None (No triangle)

7. Edge (2, 8) - Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 8 has 2 connections. We consider this edge:
   - Shared neighbor: Node 6
   - Triangle: <2, 6, 8>

8. Edge (3, 6) - Node 3 has 2 connections and Node 6 has 5 connections. Since Node 3 has fewer connections, we consider this edge:
   - Shared neighbor: None (No triangle)

9. Edge (3, 9) - Node 3 has 2 connections and Node 9 has 6 connections. We consider this edge:
   - Shared neighbor: None (No triangle)

10. Edge (5, 0) - Node 5 has 4 connections and Node 0 has 3 connections. Since Node 0 has fewer connections, we consider this edge:
   - Shared neighbor: Node 9
   - Triangle: <0, 5, 9>

11. Continuing the same steps for the remaining edges, we find more triangles:
   - Triangle: <6, 8, 2>
   - Triangle: <6, 9, 0>

Counting the total number of triangles found: [4]
