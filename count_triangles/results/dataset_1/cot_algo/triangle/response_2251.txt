Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
0 (degree 1), 1 (degree 1), 2 (degree 0), 6 (degree 2), 5 (degree 2), 7 (degree 2), 9 (degree 5), 8 (degree 5), 3 (degree 6), 4 (degree 6).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles in the graph:

Triangles:
- <4, 8, 9>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 8, 6>
- <4, 8, 3>
- <4, 8, 6>
- <7, 9, 4>
- <7, 9, 5>

Total number of triangles: [12]
