Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertex 0 has 1 connection
Vertex 9 has 1 connection
Vertex 2 has 0 connections
Vertex 6 has 2 connections
Vertex 4 has 2 connections
Vertex 5 has 2 connections
Vertex 1 has 3 connections
Vertex 7 has 3 connections
Vertex 8 has 4 connections
Vertex 3 has 6 connections

Reordering the vertices:
Vertex 2 (0 connections)
Vertex 0 (1 connection)
Vertex 9 (1 connection)
Vertex 4 (2 connections)
Vertex 5 (2 connections)
Vertex 6 (2 connections)
Vertex 1 (3 connections)
Vertex 7 (3 connections)
Vertex 8 (4 connections)
Vertex 3 (6 connections)

Counting the triangles:
For the given edges, the triangles formed are:
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
