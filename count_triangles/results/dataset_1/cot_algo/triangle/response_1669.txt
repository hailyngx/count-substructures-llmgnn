Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order:
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 1) - Check for shared connections: 9
(0, 4) - Check for shared connections: 5
(0, 5) - Check for shared connections: 8
(0, 8) - Check for shared connections: None
(1, 9) - Check for shared connections: 2
(2, 5) - Check for shared connections: None
(2, 9) - Check for shared connections: None
(3, 5) - Check for shared connections: None
(4, 9) - Check for shared connections: None
(5, 6) - Check for shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 8>
