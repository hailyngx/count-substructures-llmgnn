Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we relabel the vertices as follows: 

Vertex 0 has 1 connection  
Vertex 1 has 2 connections  
Vertex 6 has 2 connections  
Vertex 9 has 2 connections  
Vertex 7 has 4 connections  
Vertex 5 has 5 connections  
Vertex 2 has 5 connections  
Vertex 4 has 6 connections  
Vertex 8 has 6 connections  
Vertex 3 has 6 connections  

Now, we go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed by each edge. Since the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we only proceed with edges where this condition is met:

- Edge (0, 7) forms 1 triangle: <0, 7, 1>
- Edge (1, 5) forms 3 triangles: <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 8>
- Edge (1, 7) forms 1 triangle: <1, 7, 0>
- Edge (2, 3) forms 2 triangles: <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 7>
- Edge (2, 4) forms 4 triangles: <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 6>
- Edge (2, 9) forms 0 triangles
- Edge (3, 5) forms 4 triangles: <3, 5, 4>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 5, 7>
- Edge (3, 8) forms 3 triangles: <3, 8, 4>, <3, 8, 5>, <3, 8, 6>
- Edge (4, 5) forms 5 triangles: <4, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 3>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 7>
- Edge (4, 6) forms 4 triangles: <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 3>
- Edge (4, 8) forms 3 triangles: <4, 8, 5>, <4, 8, 3>, <4, 8, 6>
- Edge (5, 1) forms 4 triangles: <5, 1, 7>, <5, 1, 3>, <5, 1, 4>, <5, 1, 8>
- Edge (5, 3) forms 4 triangles: <5, 3, 4>, <5, 3, 1>, <5, 3, 8>, <5, 3, 7>
- Edge (5, 8) forms 4 triangles: <5, 8, 3>, <5, 8, 4>, <5, 8, 6>, <5, 8, 1>
- Edge (6, 4) forms 3 triangles: <6, 4, 8>, <6, 4, 5>, <6, 4, 7>
- Edge (6, 8) forms 3 triangles: <6, 8, 4>, <6, 8, 5>, <6, 8, 3>
- Edge (7, 0) forms 1 triangle: <7, 0, 1>
- Edge (7, 1) forms 2 triangles: <7, 1, 5>, <7, 1, 3>
- Edge (7, 3) forms 2 triangles: <7, 3, 5>, <7, 3, 1>
- Edge (7, 4) forms 3 triangles: <7, 4, 5>, <7, 4, 1>, <7, 4, 3>
- Edge (8, 3) forms 3 triangles: <8, 3, 4>, <8, 3, 5>, <8, 3, 6>
- Edge (8, 4) forms 4 triangles: <8, 4, 5>, <8, 4, 6>, <8, 4, 7>, <8, 4, 3>
- Edge (8, 5) forms 4 triangles: <8, 5, 4>, <8, 5, 6>, <8, 5, 7>, <8, 5, 3>
- Edge (8, 6) forms 3 triangles: <8, 6, 5>, <8, 6, 7>, <8, 6, 4>
- Edge (9, 2) forms 0 triangles

The total number of triangles in the graph is [67].
