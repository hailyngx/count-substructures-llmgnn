Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly, the degrees of the vertices are:  
Vertex 0 has degree 3  
Vertex 1 has degree 1  
Vertex 5 has degree 2  
Vertex 7 has degree 1  
Vertex 4 has degree 2  
Vertex 6 has degree 4  
Vertex 3 has degree 5  
Vertex 9 has degree 4  
Vertex 2 has degree 5  
Vertex 8 has degree 6  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges, we find the following triangles:  
<2, 8, 3>  
<2, 8, 5>  
<3, 2, 9>  
<3, 8, 4>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
