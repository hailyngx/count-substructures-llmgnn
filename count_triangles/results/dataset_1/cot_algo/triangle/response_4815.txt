Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 2 -> Label 0
Node 1 -> Label 1
Node 6 -> Label 2
Node 9 -> Label 3
Node 5 -> Label 4
Node 3 -> Label 5
Node 7 -> Label 6
Node 4 -> Label 7
Node 8 -> Label 8
Node 0 -> Label 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph. 
Based on the given edges, the triangles found are:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
