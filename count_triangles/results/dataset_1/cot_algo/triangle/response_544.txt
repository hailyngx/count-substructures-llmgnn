Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 10: 0 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. Edge (1, 9): No triangles can be formed.
2. Edge (2, 3): No triangles can be formed.
3. Edge (2, 4): No triangles can be formed.
4. Edge (2, 5): No triangles can be formed.
5. Edge (3, 2): No triangles can be formed.
6. Edge (3, 6): Triangle <2, 3, 6> is formed.
7. Edge (3, 8): No triangles can be formed.
8. Edge (4, 2): No triangles can be formed.
9. Edge (4, 8): No triangles can be formed.
10. Edge (4, 9): No triangles can be formed.
11. Edge (5, 2): No triangles can be formed.
12. Edge (5, 6): No triangles can be formed.
13. Edge (6, 3): Triangle <3, 6, 8> is formed.
14. Edge (6, 5): No triangles can be formed.
15. Edge (6, 8): No triangles can be formed.
16. Edge (8, 3): No triangles can be formed.
17. Edge (8, 4): No triangles can be formed.
18. Edge (8, 6): No triangles can be formed.
19. Edge (9, 1): No triangles can be formed.
20. Edge (9, 4): No triangles can be formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles: <2, 3, 6> <3, 6, 8>
