Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 1(1), 6(1), 1(2), 4(2), 0(3), 5(4), 2(5), 8(6), 7(6), 3(6)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges with the vertex of lower label having fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <0, 3, 5>
- Edge (2, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <2, 7, 9>
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5> and <2, 7, 9>.
