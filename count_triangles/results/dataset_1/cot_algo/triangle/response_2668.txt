Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Node 6 - Degree 0
Node 4 - Degree 1
Node 9 - Degree 1
Node 8 - Degree 2
Node 5 - Degree 3
Node 1 - Degree 3
Node 7 - Degree 3
Node 0 - Degree 4
Node 3 - Degree 4
Node 2 - Degree 5

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangle 1: <0, 2, 3>
Triangle 2: <0, 3, 5>
Triangle 3: <0, 3, 7>
Triangle 4: <0, 3, 1>
Triangle 5: <2, 3, 5>
Triangle 6: <2, 0, 3>
Triangle 7: <2, 0, 7>
Triangle 8: <2, 0, 8>
Triangle 9: <2, 5, 3>
Triangle 10: <7, 0, 3>
Triangle 11: <7, 0, 1>
Triangle 12: <7, 0, 8>
Triangle 13: <8, 0, 3>
Triangle 14: <8, 0, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
