Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling will be as follows:  
Node 2 has 2 connections.  
Node 1 has 3 connections.  
Node 8 has 3 connections.  
Node 5 has 3 connections.  
Node 4 has 3 connections.  
Node 7 has 5 connections.  
Node 6 has 5 connections.  
Node 9 has 6 connections.  
Node 3 has 6 connections.  
Node 0 has 6 connections.  

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Looking at edge (0, 2): Both nodes have 6 connections. As 0 < 2, we proceed to check for shared connections. They have 0 shared connections, so no triangle is formed.

- Looking at edge (0, 6): Node 0 has 6 connections, which is less than the 7 connections of node 6. As 0 < 6, we proceed to check for shared connections. They share 3 connections (2, 9, 9), forming the triangle <0, 2, 9>.

- Looking at edge (0, 9): Node 0 has 6 connections, which is less than the 6 connections of node 9. As 0 < 9, we proceed to check for shared connections. They have 1 shared connection (2), forming the triangle <0, 2, 9>.

- Continuing this process for all edges, we find that there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
