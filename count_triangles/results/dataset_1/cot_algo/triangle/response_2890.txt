Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degree from least to most connections, the new ordering is as follows: 
Vertices: 4, 5, 8, 1, 4, 6, 3, 9, 2, 0

Now, we'll look at each edge in the original graph based on the relabeled vertices:

4-5: Both have 0 connections. No triangle.
5-8: 5 has 2 connections, 8 has 2 connections. No triangle.
8-1: 8 has 2 connections, 1 has 3 connections. No triangle.
1-4: 1 has 3 connections, 4 has 0 connections. No triangle.
4-6: 4 has 0 connections, 6 has 3 connections. No triangle.
6-3: 6 has 3 connections, 3 has 4 connections. No triangle.
3-9: 3 has 4 connections, 9 has 3 connections. No triangle.
9-2: 9 has 3 connections, 2 has 4 connections. No triangle.
2-0: 2 has 4 connections, 0 has 7 connections. 
   Shared connections between 2 and 0 are: 7.
   Triangle found: <0, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 2, 7>.
