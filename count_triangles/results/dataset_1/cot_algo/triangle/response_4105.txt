Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph with labeled vertices based on degree-based ordering is as follows:  

Node 0: 2 connections  
Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 6: 2 connections  
Node 7: 2 connections  
Node 8: 1 connection  
Node 9: 2 connections  

Considering the vertices in increasing order of connections, the edges that will form triangles are:
1. (1, 0) shares a connection 0, forming a triangle with vertex 0.  
2. (2, 4) shares a connection 3, forming a triangle with vertex 3.  
3. (4, 6) shares a connection 2, forming a triangle with vertex 2.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].  
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 6>.
