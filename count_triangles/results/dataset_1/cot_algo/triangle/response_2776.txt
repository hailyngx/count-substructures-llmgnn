Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes based on their degree:

Node 0: degree 3  
Node 1: degree 2  
Node 2: degree 3  
Node 3: degree 6  
Node 4: degree 2  
Node 5: degree 3  
Node 6: degree 2  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 3  

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree in increasing order:

Node 1: degree 2  
Node 4: degree 2  
Node 6: degree 2  
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 3  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 3: degree 6  

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge between nodes 0 and 3:
   Shared neighbors: 2, 7, 8
   Triangle: <0, 2, 7>

2. Edge between nodes 0 and 7:
   Shared neighbors: 3, 1, 8
   Triangle: <0, 3, 1>

3. Edge between nodes 0 and 8:
   Shared neighbors: 3, 1, 7
   Triangle: <0, 7, 1>

4. Edge between nodes 1 and 7:
   Shared neighbors: 0, 8
   Triangle: <1, 0, 8>

5. Edge between nodes 1 and 8:
   Shared neighbors: 0, 7
   Triangle: <1, 0, 7>

6. Edge between nodes 2 and 3:
   Shared neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6
   Triangles: <2, 0, 4>, <2, 0, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 6>

7. Edge between nodes 2 and 4:
   Shared neighbors: 3
   Triangle: <2, 3, 4>

8. Edge between nodes 2 and 5:
   Shared neighbors: 3
   Triangle: <2, 3, 5>

9. Edge between nodes 3 and 4:
   Shared neighbors: 2
   Triangle: <3, 2, 4>

10. Edge between nodes 3 and 5:
    Shared neighbors: 2
    Triangle: <3, 2, 5>

11. Edge between nodes 3 and 6:
    Shared neighbors: 2
    Triangle: <3, 2, 6>

12. Edge between nodes 4 and 5:
    Shared neighbors: 2
    Triangle: <4, 2, 5>

13. Edge between nodes 5 and 6:
    Shared neighbors: 3
    Triangle: <5, 3, 6>

14. Edge between nodes 7 and 8:
    Shared neighbors: 0, 1
    Triangle: <7, 0, 1>

Total number of triangles: [15]
