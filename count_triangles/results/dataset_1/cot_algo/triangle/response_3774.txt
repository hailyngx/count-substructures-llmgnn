Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections (degree) in ascending order:

Vertices: 6, 0, 9, 2, 7, 4, 5, 1, 8, 3

Now, we will re-label the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 6 has degree 1
Vertex 0 has degree 3
Vertex 9 has degree 3
Vertex 2 has degree 2
Vertex 7 has degree 2
Vertex 4 has degree 2
Vertex 5 has degree 3
Vertex 1 has degree 3
Vertex 8 has degree 4
Vertex 3 has degree 4

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 < Vertex 1, shared connections: 1 (Vertex 8), form triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 < Vertex 3, shared connections: 1 (Vertex 8), form triangle <0, 3, 8>
- Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 < Vertex 8, shared connections: 1 (Vertex 1), form triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 < Vertex 7, shared connections: 0, no triangle
- Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 < Vertex 8, shared connections: 1 (Vertex 0), form triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 < Vertex 4, shared connections: 1 (Vertex 5), form triangle <2, 4, 5>
- Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 < Vertex 7, shared connections: 0, no triangle
- Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 < Vertex 4, shared connections: 1 (Vertex 5), form triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 < Vertex 5, shared connections: 2 (Vertex 8, Vertex 4), form triangles <4, 5, 8> and <2, 3, 5>
- Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 < Vertex 9, shared connections: 0, no triangle
- Edge (4, 5): Vertex 4 < Vertex 5, shared connections: 1 (Vertex 3), form triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5 < Vertex 8, shared connections: 1 (Vertex 3), form triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Edge (7, 2): Vertex 7 < Vertex 2, shared connections: 0, no triangle
- Edge (8, 0): Vertex 0 < Vertex 8, shared connections: 1 (Vertex 1), form triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Edge (8, 1): Vertex 1 < Vertex 8, shared connections: 1 (Vertex 0), form triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Edge (8, 5): Vertex 5 < Vertex 8, shared connections: 1 (Vertex 3), form triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Edge (9, 3): Vertex 9 < Vertex 3, shared connections: 0, no triangle
- Edge (9, 5): Vertex 9 < Vertex 5, shared connections: 0, no triangle

So, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, and <4, 5, 8>.
