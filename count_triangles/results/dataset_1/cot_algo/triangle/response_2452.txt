Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Node 5 -> Degree 1
Node 7 -> Degree 2
Node 4 -> Degree 2
Node 6 -> Degree 3
Node 1 -> Degree 3
Node 9 -> Degree 4
Node 0 -> Degree 4
Node 2 -> Degree 4
Node 8 -> Degree 5
Node 3 -> Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:

(0, 2) : Shared connections: 1, 4, 3, 7 => Triangle <0, 3, 7>
(0, 3) : Shared connections: 1, 2, 7, 8 => Triangle <0, 2, 8>
(0, 4) : Shared connections: 6 => Triangle <0, 6, 4>
(0, 7) : Shared connections: 2, 9 => Triangle <0, 2, 9>
(1, 2) : Shared connections: 0, 3, 7 => Triangle <1, 0, 7>
(1, 3) : Shared connections: 0, 2, 8, 9 => Triangle <1, 2, 9>
(1, 6) : Shared connections: 0, 4 => Triangle <1, 0, 4>
(2, 7) : Shared connections: 0, 3, 8 => Triangle <2, 0, 8>
(3, 8) : Shared connections: 0, 2, 9 => Triangle <3, 2, 9>
(3, 9) : Shared connections: 0, 1, 8 => Triangle <3, 1, 8>
(4, 6) : Shared connections: 0 => Triangle <4, 0, 6>
(6, 8) : Shared connections: 1, 3 => Triangle <6, 1, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
