Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices by degree:
0: 2
1: 4
2: 3
3: 4
4: 3
5: 2
6: 2
7: 2
8: 1
9: 4

Vertices sorted by degree:
8, 0, 5, 6, 7, 2, 4, 9, 3, 1

Now, we count the triangles by examining each edge:

Triangles:
[8]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
