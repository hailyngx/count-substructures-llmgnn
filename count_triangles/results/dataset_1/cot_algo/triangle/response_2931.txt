Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 3 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles in the graph:
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <6, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
