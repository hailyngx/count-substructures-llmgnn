Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Nodes: (0) (1) (4) (5) (9) (3) (8) (6) (2) (7)

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 3, 7>
4. <0, 4, 8>
5. <2, 6, 7>
6. <2, 7, 8>
7. <3, 6, 7>
8. <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
