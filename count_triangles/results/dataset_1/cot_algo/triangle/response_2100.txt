Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Node 8 has 0 connection(s).
- Nodes 2 and 6 have 1 connection(s).
- Nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, and 8 have 2 connection(s).
- Nodes 3 and 6 have 3 connection(s).
- Node 4 has the most connections with 5.

After relabeling the nodes based on their degree, the edges are:
(0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 7), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 7), (6, 0), (7, 4), (7, 5), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4)

Now, we will check for triangles:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles is [2].
