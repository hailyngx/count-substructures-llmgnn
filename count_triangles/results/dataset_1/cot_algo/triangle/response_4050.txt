Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to find the degrees of each node:
Node 0: 2 edges
Node 1: 6 edges
Node 2: 2 edges
Node 3: 6 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 5: 2 edges
Node 6: 2 edges
Node 7: 2 edges
Node 8: 3 edges
Node 9: 4 edges

Sorting nodes by their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 4, 9, 3, 1

Now we proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- Edge (0, 1): Node 0 is lower degree than Node 1, so we proceed.
    Shared connections of nodes 0 and 1: 1 (Node 1)
- Edge (0, 3): Node 0 is lower degree than Node 3, so we proceed.
    Shared connections of nodes 0 and 3: 1 (Node 1)
- Edge (1, 3): Node 1 is lower degree than Node 3, so we proceed.
    Shared connections of nodes 1 and 3: 2 (Nodes 0, 2)
- Edge (1, 2): Node 1 is higher degree than Node 2, we skip.
- Edge (1, 7): Node 1 is higher degree than Node 7, we skip.
- Edge (1, 8): Node 1 is higher degree than Node 8, we skip.
- Edge (2, 4): Node 2 is lower degree than Node 4, so we proceed.
    Shared connections of nodes 2 and 4: 1 (Node 3)
- Edge (3, 4): Node 3 is higher degree than Node 4, we skip.
- Edge (3, 7): Node 3 is higher degree than Node 7, we skip.
- Edge (3, 8): Node 3 is higher degree than Node 8, we skip.
- Edge (3, 9): Node 3 is higher degree than Node 9, we skip.
- Edge (4, 6): Node 4 is higher degree than Node 6, we skip.
- Edge (5, 6): Node 5 is lower degree than Node 6, so we proceed.
    Shared connections of nodes 5 and 6: None
- Edge (5, 9): Node 5 is lower degree than Node 9, so we proceed.
    Shared connections of nodes 5 and 9: 1 (Node 3)
- Edge (6, 5): Node 6 is higher degree than Node 5, we skip.
- Edge (7, 1): Node 7 is lower degree than Node 1, so we proceed.
    Shared connections of nodes 7 and 1: 1 (Node 3)
- Edge (7, 3): Node 7 is lower degree than Node 3, so we proceed.
    Shared connections of nodes 7 and 3: 1 (Node 1)
- Edge (8, 1): Node 8 is lower degree than Node 1, so we proceed.
    Shared connections of nodes 8 and 1: 1 (Node 3)
- Edge (8, 3): Node 8 is lower degree than Node 3, so we proceed.
    Shared connections of nodes 8 and 3: 1 (Node 1)
- Edge (8, 9): Node 8 is lower degree than Node 9, so we proceed.
    Shared connections of nodes 8 and 9: 1 (Node 3)
- Edge (9, 3): Node 9 is higher degree than Node 3, we skip.
- Edge (9, 5): Node 9 is higher degree than Node 5, we skip.
- Edge (9, 8): Node 9 is higher degree than Node 8, we skip.

Total triangles: 3
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <2, 4, 3>, <5, 9, 3> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
