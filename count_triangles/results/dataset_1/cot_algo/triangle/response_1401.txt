Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices will be as follows:
Node 0 - 4 connections
Node 3 - 4 connections
Node 7 - 4 connections
Node 8 - 1 connection
Node 9 - 2 connections
Node 1 - 3 connections
Node 6 - 4 connections
Node 2 - 4 connections
Node 4 - 4 connections
Node 5 - 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 4, 0>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 0, 5>
<4, 2, 0>
<4, 2, 7>
<4, 6, 5>
<5, 0, 3>
<5, 0, 6>
<5, 3, 6>
<6, 1, 5>
<6, 2, 4>
<6, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [18].
