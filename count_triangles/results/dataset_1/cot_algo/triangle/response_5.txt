Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Here is the sorted list of vertices:
Vertices: 3, 7, 4, 8, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, 9

Next, we will relabel the vertices:
Vertex 3 (Degree 0) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 7 (Degree 0) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 4 (Degree 2) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 8 (Degree 2) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 1 (Degree 3) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 2 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 5 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 0 (Degree 5) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 6 (Degree 6) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 9 (Degree 6) -> Vertex 9

Now we will list the edges according to the new labeling:
(7, 4), (7, 2), (7, 8), (7, 9), (4, 7), (4, 5), (4, 8), (5, 4), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 8), (0, 8), (0, 3), (0, 7), (9, 8), (9, 6), (9, 7), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (1, 7), (1, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)

Now, we will count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge:
Triangles:
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 5, 6> 

Total number of triangles: [4]
