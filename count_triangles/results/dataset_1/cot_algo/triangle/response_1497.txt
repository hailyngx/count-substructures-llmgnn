Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
- Node 5 has 0 connections.
- Node 0 has 1 connection.
- Node 7 has 1 connection.
- Node 1 has 2 connections.
- Node 9 has 2 connections.
- Node 3 has 3 connections.
- Node 6 has 3 connections.
- Node 8 has 4 connections.
- Node 2 has 5 connections.
- Node 4 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking only for edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 8, 2>
4. <2, 4, 9>
5. <2, 8, 9>
6. <4, 3, 1>
7. <4, 7, 0>
8. <8, 2, 4>
9. <8, 2, 9>
10. <8, 1, 3>
11. <8, 1, 4>
12. <8, 9, 2>
13. <9, 2, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
