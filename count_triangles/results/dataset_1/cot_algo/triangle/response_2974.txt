Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Nodes and their connections:
- 0: 2 connections
- 1: 4 connections
- 2: 2 connections
- 3: 2 connections
- 4: 2 connections
- 5: 2 connections
- 6: 4 connections
- 7: 4 connections
- 8: 3 connections
- 9: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on the number of connections in ascending order:
- 0: 0 connections
- 2: 2 connections
- 3: 2 connections
- 4: 2 connections
- 5: 2 connections
- 9: 2 connections
- 1: 4 connections
- 6: 4 connections
- 7: 4 connections
- 8: 5 connections

Next, we will follow the degree-based ordering method to count the triangles:

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 7>
- <1, 8, 2>
- <1, 8, 9>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <4, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
