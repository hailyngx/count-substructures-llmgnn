Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be:  
Node 5 has 0 connection.  
Nodes 0 and 7 have 1 connection.  
Nodes 1 and 4 have 2 connections.  
Nodes 2 and 8 have 3 connections.  
Nodes 3 and 9 have 4 connections.  
Node 6 has the most connections with 5 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze each edge starting from the one involving the vertex with the lower label and count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 4>  
<1, 4, 7>  
<0, 2, 4>  
<3, 6, 9>  
<1, 6, 9>  
<0, 1, 6>  
<0, 3, 9>  
<4, 6, 7>
