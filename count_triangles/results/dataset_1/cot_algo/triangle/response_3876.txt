Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 2 -> 3 connections
Node 0 -> 3 connections
Node 5 -> 3 connections
Node 4 -> 3 connections
Node 6 -> 4 connections
Node 9 -> 4 connections
Node 1 -> 4 connections
Node 8 -> 5 connections
Node 3 -> 6 connections
Node 7 -> 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 7, 8>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <1, 4, 7>
6. <2, 5, 9>
7. <3, 6, 7>
8. <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
