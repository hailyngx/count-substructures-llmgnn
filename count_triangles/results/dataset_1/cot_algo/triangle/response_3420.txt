Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices in order of their degree (number of connections):
Vertices: 2, 4, 3, 6, 8, 1, 7, 9, 5, 0

Now, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.

For each edge, we will only consider the cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

- Considering edge (0, 1):
    - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 9, 5, 1.
    - Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 0, 7.
    - Shared connections between vertices 0 and 1 are 0, forming a triangle <0, 1, 0>.
    
- Considering edge (0, 5):
    - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 9, 5.
    - Vertex 5 has connections with vertices 6, 3, 0.
    - Shared connections between vertices 0 and 5 are 0, 5, forming a triangle <0, 5, 0>.
    
- Considering edge (0, 9):
    - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 5, 9.
    - Vertex 9 has connections with vertices 7, 6, 0.
    - Shared connections between vertices 0 and 9 are 0, forming a triangle <0, 9, 0>.

- Considering edge (1, 7):
    - Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 0, 7.
    - Vertex 7 has connections with vertices 8, 9, 1.
    - Shared connections between vertices 1 and 7 are 1, forming a triangle <1, 7, 1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 0>, <0, 5, 0>, <0, 9, 0>, <1, 7, 1>.
