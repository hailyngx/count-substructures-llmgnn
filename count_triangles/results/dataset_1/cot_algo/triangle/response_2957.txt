Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph, the sorted vertices along with their degrees are as follows:
(6): 1
(7): 2
(9): 2
(4): 3
(3): 3
(1): 4
(0): 5
(2): 5
(8): 6

Based on the sorted list, we can count the triangles in the graph:
1. (0, 2, 8)
2. (1, 4, 8)
3. (1, 8, 9)
4. (3, 8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, and <3, 8, 9>.
