Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 7: 0 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 9: 1 connection
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 2: 6 connections

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles, we find the following:
- Triangle <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle <2, 3, 8>
- Triangle <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle <3, 5, 6>
- Triangle <4, 6, 5>
- Triangle <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
