Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by the number of connections:

0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 2)
9 (degree 1)
7 (degree 2)
8 (degree 4)
4 (degree 4)
6 (degree 5)
3 (degree 5)
5 (degree 5)
2 (degree 7)

Now, we go through each edge while considering the lower labeled vertex with fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 7) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (1, 9) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (2, 3) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4) leads to a triangle: <2, 4, 5>.
- Edge (2, 5) leads to a triangle: <2, 4, 5>.
- Edge (2, 6) leads to a triangle: <2, 4, 6>.
- Edge (2, 8) leads to a triangle: <2, 4, 8> and <2, 6, 8>.
- Edge (3, 2) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (3, 5) leads to a triangle: <3, 5, 2>.
- Edge (3, 6) leads to a triangle: <3, 6, 2> and <3, 6, 5>.
- Edge (3, 8) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (4, 2) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (4, 5) leads to a triangle: <4, 5, 2>.
- Edge (4, 6) leads to a triangle: <4, 6, 2> and <4, 6, 5>.
- Edge (5, 2) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (5, 3) leads to a triangle: <5, 3, 2>.
- Edge (5, 4) leads to a triangle: <5, 3, 4>.
- Edge (6, 2) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (6, 3) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (6, 4) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (6, 8) leads to a triangle: <6, 2, 8> and <6, 4, 8>.
- Edge (7, 0) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (7, 1) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (8, 2) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (8, 3) doesn't lead to a triangle.
- Edge (8, 6) leads to a triangle: <8, 2, 6>.
- Edge (9, 1) doesn't lead to a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12], and the unique triangles found are <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 2>, <3, 6, 2>, <3, 6, 5>, <4, 5, 2>, <4, 6, 2>, <4, 6, 5>, <5, 3, 4>, and <6, 4, 8>.
