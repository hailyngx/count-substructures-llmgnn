Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0 has 1 connection
Node 3 has 1 connection
Node 9 has 2 connections
Node 4 has 3 connections
Node 6 has 3 connections
Node 8 has 3 connections
Node 5 has 4 connections
Node 7 has 4 connections
Node 2 has 5 connections
Node 1 has 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph.

We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- For edge (0, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (1, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (1, 4): Possible triangle with vertex 1
- For edge (1, 6): Possible triangle with vertex 1
- For edge (1, 7): Possible triangle with vertex 1
- For edge (1, 9): Possible triangle with vertex 1
- For edge (2, 4): Possible triangle with vertex 2
- For edge (2, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (2, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (2, 8): No triangles can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 4, 6> 
<1, 4, 7> 
<1, 6, 7> 
<1, 4, 9>
