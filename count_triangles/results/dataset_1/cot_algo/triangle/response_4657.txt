Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps:
1. Sort vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order.
2. Relabel the vertices according to their sorted order.
3. Count the number of triangles by considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph, the sorted order of vertices with their degrees is as follows:
Vertex: 0, Degree: 1
Vertex: 7, Degree: 2
Vertex: 6, Degree: 2
Vertex: 5, Degree: 3
Vertex: 9, Degree: 3
Vertex: 8, Degree: 3
Vertex: 2, Degree: 4
Vertex: 1, Degree: 5
Vertex: 4, Degree: 5
Vertex: 3, Degree: 6

Now, we will count the number of triangles by considering the edges:
(0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7)

Total number of triangles: [13]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 3>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 5, 3>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 5, 2>, <3, 5, 4>, <4, 5, 2>, <4, 5, 3>
