Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for each vertex are:
- Vertex 0: 1 connection
- Vertex 3: 1 connection
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 4 connections

Now, considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 1) -> Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 3) -> Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 4) -> Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 5) -> Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 7) -> Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 9) -> Shared connections: None
- Edge (4, 6) -> Shared connections: None
- Edge (6, 8) -> Shared connections: None
- Edge (7, 9) -> Shared connections: None

The total number of triangles found is 0. So, the answer is:
[0]
