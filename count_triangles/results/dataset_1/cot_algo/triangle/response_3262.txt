Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the degrees of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 1

Next, we order the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes in ascending order of degrees: 9, 0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 7, 5, 8, 6

Now, let's count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Node 9 (degree 1) is connected to nodes 7 and 7. No triangles.
- Node 0 (degree 2) is connected to node 8. No triangles.
- Node 1 (degree 2) is connected to node 7. No triangles.
- Node 3 (degree 2) is connected to node 5. No triangles.
- Node 4 (degree 2) is connected to node 6. No triangles.
- Node 2 (degree 2) is not connected to any other node. No triangles.
- Node 7 (degree 5) is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, 5, and 9. 
  - Triangle <1, 5, 7> found.
- Node 5 (degree 4) is connected to nodes 3, 6, 6, and 7. 
  - Triangles <3, 6, 5> and <6, 7, 5> found.
- Node 8 (degree 5) is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 6, and 7. 
  - Triangle <0, 6, 8> found.
- Node 6 (degree 5) is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, 5, and 8. 
  - Triangle <4, 8, 6> found.

Count of triangles: [4]
Triangles found: <1, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 5>, <6, 7, 5>, <0, 6, 8>.
