Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new vertex labels are as follows:  
Vertices: {2, 4, 8, 0, 5, 2, 3, 6, 1, 7}

Now, we will look at each edge and count the number of triangles:

Edge (0, 1):
Shared connections: 6, 7
Triangles: {0, 1, 6}, {0, 1, 7}

Edge (0, 5):
Shared connections: None

Edge (0, 6):
Shared connections: None

Edge (0, 7):
Shared connections: None

Edge (1, 3):
Shared connections: None

Edge (1, 6):
Shared connections: None

Edge (1, 7):
Shared connections: None

Edge (2, 3):
Shared connections: None

Edge (2, 7):
Shared connections: None

Edge (3, 1):
Shared connections: None

Edge (3, 2):
Shared connections: None

Edge (3, 6):
Shared connections: None

Edge (3, 7):
Shared connections: None

Edge (4, 5):
Shared connections: None

Edge (4, 6):
Shared connections: None

Edge (4, 8):
Shared connections: None

Edge (5, 0):
Shared connections: None

Edge (5, 4):
Shared connections: None

Edge (5, 8):
Shared connections: None

Edge (6, 0):
Shared connections: None

Edge (6, 1):
Shared connections: None

Edge (6, 3):
Shared connections: None

Edge (6, 4):
Shared connections: None

Edge (6, 7):
Shared connections: None

Edge (7, 0):
Shared connections: None

Edge (7, 1):
Shared connections: None

Edge (7, 2):
Shared connections: None

Edge (7, 3):
Shared connections: None

Edge (7, 6):
Shared connections: None

Edge (8, 4):
Shared connections: None

Edge (8, 5):
Shared connections: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>.
