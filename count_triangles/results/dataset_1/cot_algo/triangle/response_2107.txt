Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 6 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices from least to most connections:
Vertex 3 -> 0
Vertex 6 -> 1
Vertex 0 -> 2
Vertex 1 -> 3
Vertex 5 -> 4
Vertex 7 -> 5
Vertex 2 -> 6
Vertex 4 -> 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Triangles:
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [4]
