Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
As a first step, let's list the number of connections each node has:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections

Sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling:
- Node 2 (1 connection)
- Node 3 (1 connection)
- Node 5 (1 connection)
- Node 0 (2 connections)
- Node 1 (2 connections)
- Node 4 (2 connections)
- Node 9 (2 connections)
- Node 7 (3 connections)
- Node 6 (4 connections)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (2, 5) is skipped.
- Edge (3, 1) is skipped.
- Edge (2, 5) is skipped.
- Edge (0, 6):
  - Shared connections with node 0 and node 6 are: 7
  - Triangle found: <0, 6, 7>

- Edge (0, 7):
  - Shared connections with node 0 and node 7 are: 6
  - Triangle found: <0, 6, 7>

- Edge (1, 3) is skipped.
- Edge (2, 5) is skipped.
- Edge (4, 6):
  - Shared connections with node 4 and node 6 are: 9
  - Triangle found: <4, 6, 9>

- Edge (4, 9) is skipped.
- Edge (2, 5) is skipped.
- Edge (6, 0):
  - Shared connections with node 6 and node 0 are: 7
  - Triangle found: <0, 6, 7>

- Edge (6, 4):
  - Shared connections with node 6 and node 4 are: 9
  - Triangle found: <4, 6, 9>

- Edge (6, 9):
  - Shared connections with node 6 and node 9 are: 4
  - Triangle found: <4, 6, 9>

- Edge (7, 0):
  - Shared connections with node 7 and node 0 are: 6
  - Triangle found: <0, 6, 7>

- Edge (7, 1) is skipped.
- Edge (2, 5) is skipped.
- Edge (6, 7):
  - Shared connections with node 6 and node 7 are: 0
  - Triangle found: <0, 6, 7>

- Edge (6, 9):
  - Shared connections with node 6 and node 9 are: 4
  - Triangle found: <4, 6, 9>

- Edge (7, 1) is skipped.

The total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
