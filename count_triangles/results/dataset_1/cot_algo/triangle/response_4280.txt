Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree of connections from least to most. Based on the given graph, the sorted vertices are as follows:
Vertices: 1, 5
Vertices: 0, 5, 8
Vertices: 7
Vertices: 6, 9
Vertices: 2
Vertices: 3, 4

Let's identify triangles based on this ordering:
1. Edge (0, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 2>
2. Edge (0, 4): No triangles formed
3. Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed
4. Edge (2, 3): No triangles formed
5. Edge (2, 4): No triangles formed
6. Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed
7. Edge (3, 0): Triangle <0, 3, 2>
8. Edge (3, 2): Triangle <0, 3, 2>
9. Edge (3, 6): No triangles formed
10. Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed
11. Edge (4, 0): No triangles formed
12. Edge (4, 2): No triangles formed
13. Edge (4, 7): No triangles formed
14. Edge (4, 8): No triangles formed
15. Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed
16. Edge (6, 3): No triangles formed
17. Edge (6, 5): No triangles formed
18. Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed
19. Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed
20. Edge (7, 1): No triangles formed
21. Edge (7, 4): No triangles formed
22. Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed
23. Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed
24. Edge (8, 4): No triangles formed
25. Edge (9, 3): No triangles formed
26. Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
