Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 6

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 9): Both nodes have the lowest degree, so we proceed. No triangles are formed.
2. Edge (1, 3): Node 1 has a higher degree than node 3, so we skip this edge.
3. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 has a higher degree than node 5, so we skip this edge.
4. Edge (1, 7): Node 1 has a higher degree than node 7, so we skip this edge.
5. Edge (1, 8): Node 1 has a higher degree than node 8, so we skip this edge.
6. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 has a lower degree than node 4, so we proceed to check for triangles. Shared connections: Node 3. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 4>.
7. Edge (2, 5): Node 2 has a lower degree than node 5, so we proceed. Shared connections: Node 3. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>.
8. Edge (2, 9): Node 2 has a lower degree than node 9, so we proceed. No triangles are formed.
9. Edge (3, 1): Node 3 has a lower degree than node 1, so we proceed. No triangles are formed.
10. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has a lower degree than node 4, so we proceed to check for triangles. Shared connections: Node 5. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>.
11. Edge (3, 5): Node 3 has a lower degree than node 5, so we proceed to check for triangles. Shared connections: Node 2, Node 4. Triangles formed: <2, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 5>.
12. Edge (4, 2): Node 4 has a higher degree than node 2, so we skip this edge.
13. Edge (4, 3): Node 4 has a higher degree than node 3, so we skip this edge.
14. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 has a lower degree than node 8, so we proceed. No triangles are formed.
15. Edge (5, 1): Node 5 has a higher degree than node 1, so we skip this edge.
16. Edge (5, 2): Node 5 has a higher degree than node 2, so we skip this edge.
17. Edge (5, 3): Node 5 has a higher degree than node 3, so we skip this edge.
18. Edge (6, 7): Both nodes have the same degree, so we skip this edge.
19. Edge (7, 1): Node 7 has a lower degree than node 1, so we proceed. No triangles are formed.
20. Edge (7, 6): Both nodes have the same degree, so we skip this edge.
21. Edge (8, 1): Node 8 has a lower degree than node 1, so we proceed. No triangles are formed.
22. Edge (8, 4): Node 8 has a lower degree than node 4, so we proceed. No triangles are formed.
23. Edge (9, 0): Node 9 has a higher degree than node 0, so we skip this edge.
24. Edge (9, 2): Node 9 has a higher degree than node 2, so we skip this edge.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 5>.
