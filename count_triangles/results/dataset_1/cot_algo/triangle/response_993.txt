Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  
Node 7 (Degree 0)  
Node 2 (Degree 1)  
Node 8 (Degree 1)  
Node 6 (Degree 1)  
Node 3 (Degree 2)  
Node 8 (Degree 2)  
Node 1 (Degree 4)  
Node 5 (Degree 4)  
Node 4 (Degree 5)  
Node 0 (Degree 6)  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles in the graph.

Number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found:  
<0, 4, 9>  
<0, 1, 4>  
<0, 1, 5>  
<1, 4, 9>  
<1, 5, 9>  
<5, 4, 9>
