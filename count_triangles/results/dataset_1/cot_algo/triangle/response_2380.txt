Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new vertex labels are: 1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 4, 9.

The edges can be represented as: (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 8), (0, 1), (0, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 7), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 3), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 7), (9, 6).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following:
Number of triangles: 7
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 2>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
