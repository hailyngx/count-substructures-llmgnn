Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Node 1: 8 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 1 connection

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 1): Forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 9. Triangle <0, 1, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 5): No triangle can be formed.
3. Edge (0, 9): No triangle can be formed.
4. Edge (1, 0): No triangle can be formed.
5. Edge (1, 3): No triangle can be formed.
6. Edge (1, 4): Forms a triangle with node 7. Triangle <1, 4, 7>.
7. Edge (1, 7): No triangle can be formed.
8. Edge (2, 4): No triangle can be formed.
9. Edge (2, 6): No triangle can be formed.
10. Edge (2, 7): No triangle can be formed.
11. Edge (2, 9): No triangle can be formed.
12. Edge (3, 1): No triangle can be formed.
13. Edge (3, 6): No triangle can be formed.
14. Edge (3, 8): No triangle can be formed.
15. Edge (3, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 4. Triangle <3, 4, 6>.
16. Edge (4, 1): No triangle can be formed.
17. Edge (4, 2): No triangle can be formed.
18. Edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 7. Triangle <4, 6, 7>.
19. Edge (4, 7): No triangle can be formed.
20. Edge (5, 0): No triangle can be formed.
21. Edge (5, 9): No triangle can be formed.
22. Edge (6, 2): No triangle can be formed.
23. Edge (6, 3): No triangle can be formed.
24. Edge (6, 4): No triangle can be formed.
25. Edge (6, 7): Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 9. Triangle <6, 7, 9>.
26. Edge (6, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5. Triangle <6, 9, 0>.
27. Edge (7, 1): No triangle can be formed.
28. Edge (7, 2): No triangle can be formed.
29. Edge (7, 4): No triangle can be formed.
30. Edge (7, 6): No triangle can be formed.
31. Edge (7, 8): No triangle can be formed.
32. Edge (8, 3): No triangle can be formed.
33. Edge (8, 7): No triangle can be formed.
34. Edge (9, 0): No triangle can be formed.
35. Edge (9, 2): No triangle can be formed.
36. Edge (9, 3): No triangle can be formed.
37. Edge (9, 5): No triangle can be formed.
38. Edge (9, 6): No triangle can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
