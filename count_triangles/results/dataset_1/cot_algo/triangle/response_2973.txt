Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 1
Vertex 3: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 1
Vertex 8: degree 1

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees from lowest to highest:

Vertex 2: degree 1
Vertex 7: degree 1
Vertex 8: degree 1
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 5

Next, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

For edge 1-3: (1, 3) - Vertex 1, Vertex 3 share a connection with Vertex 8 forming a triangle <1, 3, 8>.
For edge 1-8: (1, 8) - No triangles formed.
For edge 2-3: (2, 3) - No triangles formed.
For edge 3-1: (3, 1) - No triangles formed.
For edge 3-2: (3, 2) - No triangles formed.
For edge 3-5: (3, 5) - No triangles formed.
For edge 3-7: (3, 7) - No triangles formed.
For edge 4-6: (4, 6) - No triangles formed.
For edge 5-3: (5, 3) - No triangles formed.
For edge 5-6: (5, 6) - No triangles formed.
For edge 6-4: (6, 4) - No triangles formed.
For edge 6-5: (6, 5) - No triangles formed.
For edge 7-3: (7, 3) - No triangles formed.
For edge 8-1: (8, 1) - No triangles formed.

Finally, we count the total number of triangles found:

Total triangles: [1]

Unique triangles: <1, 3, 8>
