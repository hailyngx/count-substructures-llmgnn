Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, the resulting labels for the vertices are as follows: 1(1), 2(2), 8(3), 6(4), 9(5), 5(6), 7(7), 3(8), 0(9), 4(10).

The triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<3, 0, 5>
<3, 5, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
