Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 5 has 2 connections
- Vertices 7 and 8 have 3 connections each
- Vertices 1, 3, and 6 have 4 connections each
- Vertices 2 and 9 have 5 connections each
- Vertex 0 has 6 connections
Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed by shared connections:

For edge (0, 1):
0 and 1 share 3 connections: 4, 8, 9
The triangle formed is <0, 1, 4>

For edge (0, 4):
0 and 4 share 4 connections: 1, 2, 3, 8
The triangles formed are <0, 4, 1> and <0, 4, 3>

For edge (0, 7):
Vertex 7 has 3 connections, so we don't proceed.

For edge (0, 8):
Vertex 8 has 3 connections, so we don't proceed.

For edge (0, 9):
Vertex 9 has 5 connections, so we don't proceed.

For edge (1, 3):
1 and 3 share 1 connection: 4
The triangle formed is <1, 3, 4>

For edge (1, 4):
1 and 4 share 1 connection: 0
The triangle formed is <1, 4, 0>

For edge (1, 8):
Vertex 8 has 3 connections, so we don't proceed.

For edge (2, 3):
2 and 3 share 1 connection: 4
The triangle formed is <2, 3, 4>

For edge (2, 4):
2 and 4 share 2 connections: 1, 3
The triangle formed is <2, 4, 1> 

For edge (2, 6):
Vertex 6 has 3 connections, so we don't proceed.

For edge (2, 9):
Vertex 9 has 5 connections, so we don't proceed.

For edge (3, 4):
3 and 4 share 2 connections: 1, 2
The triangle formed is <3, 4, 1>

For edge (5, 6):
Vertex 6 has 3 connections, so we don't proceed.

For edge (5, 7):
Vertex 7 has 3 connections, so we don't proceed.

For edge (6, 9):
Vertex 9 has 5 connections, so we don't proceed.

The total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 3>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 0>, and <2, 4, 1>.
