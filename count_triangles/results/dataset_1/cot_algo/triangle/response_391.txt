Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 1>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 8, 1>
<2, 8, 3>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 7, 2>
<3, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [16]
