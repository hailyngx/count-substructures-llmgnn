Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new numbering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 7 has 0 connection(s).
Node 1 has 1 connection(s).
Node 6 has 1 connection(s).
Node 0 has 4 connection(s).
Node 3 has 4 connection(s).
Node 8 has 4 connection(s).
Node 5 has 5 connection(s).
Node 4 has 5 connection(s).
Node 9 has 5 connection(s).
Node 2 has 6 connection(s).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will look at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Let's count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 3): Forms triangle with nodes 3, 5.
- Edge (1, 2): Forms triangle with nodes 1, 8.
- Edge (2, 8): Forms triangle with nodes 2, 1.
- Edge (3, 0): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 3): Forms triangle with nodes 3, 5.
- Edge (5, 0): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 0): No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 0): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is 4.

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 0, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
