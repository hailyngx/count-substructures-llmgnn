Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order. The new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 3: 0 connections
Nodes 4 and 6: 1 connection each
Nodes 5, 6, and 9: 2 connections each
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 8: 3 connections each
Node 7: 4 connections

Now we will iterate through the edges based on the lower labeled node having fewer connections:
<0, 1>: Shared connections with 2, 7
<0, 2>: Shared connection with 5
<0, 7>: Shared connection with 3
<1, 0>: Shared connections with 2, 7
<8, 1>: Shared connection with 9

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph, which are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 7, 3>
<1, 8, 9>
