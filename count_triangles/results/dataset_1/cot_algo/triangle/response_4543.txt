Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Node 3: 0 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles and identify unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [29]
