Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: <2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 1, 0, 7, 8, 9>.

Now, we can list the unique triangles formed from the shared connections between the vertices based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <0, 8, 7>
3. <1, 9, 5>
4. <4, 9, 5>
5. <7, 8, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
