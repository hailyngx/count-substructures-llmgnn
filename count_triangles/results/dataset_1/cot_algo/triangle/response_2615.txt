Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is: <3, 7, 1, 1, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5>.

Now, by following the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles: 
<0, 4, 9>  
<0, 5, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
