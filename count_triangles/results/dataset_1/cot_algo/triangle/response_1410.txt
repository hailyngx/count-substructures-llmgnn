Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
- Node 5 has 1 connection
- Nodes 1 and 9 have 2 connections each
- Nodes 0 and 5 have 3 connections each
- Nodes 2 and 8 have 4 connections each
- Nodes 3, 6, and 7 have 5 connections each
- Node 4 has 6 connections

Now, let's relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 5 (Degree 1) -> Node 0
- Nodes 1 and 9 (Degree 2) -> Node 1 and Node 2
- Nodes 0 and 5 (Degree 3) -> Node 3 and Node 4
- Nodes 2 and 8 (Degree 4) -> Node 5 and Node 6
- Nodes 3, 6, and 7 (Degree 5) -> Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9
- Node 4 (Degree 6) -> Node 10

Now, we will count the triangles. Since we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will consider the following edges: (0, 6), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (3, 9), (5, 7), (6, 8), (7, 5), (8, 9).

Counting the triangles formed by these edges, we find:
- <1, 3, 4>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <5, 7, 0>
- <6, 8, 0>

The total number of triangles is [5].
