Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0: 2 connections
8: 1 connection
5: 2 connections
9: 1 connection
6: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
3: Doesn't exist in the graph

The sorted list of vertices is: 8, 9, 0, 5, 6, 4, 1, 2, 7

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 5): Both 0 and 5 have 2 connections. Hence, check for shared connections.
   Shared connection: 7
   Triangle formed: <0, 5, 7>

2. Edge (0, 8): Both 0 and 8 have 2 and 1 connection respectively, and 0 has fewer connections. So, proceed.
   No triangle is formed.

3. Edge (1, 2): Both 1 and 2 have 3 and 4 connections respectively, and 1 has fewer connections. So, proceed.
   Shared connection: 7
   Triangle formed: <1, 2, 7>

4. Edge (1, 6): Both 1 and 6 have 3 and 2 connections respectively, and 6 has fewer connections. So, proceed.
   No triangle is formed.

5. Edge (1, 7): Both 1 and 7 have 3 and 4 connections respectively, and 1 has fewer connections. So, proceed.
   Shared connection: 2
   Triangle formed: <1, 7, 2>

6. Edge (2, 4): Both 2 and 4 have 4 connections. Hence, check for shared connections.
   Shared connection: 6
   Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>

7. Edge (2, 7): Both 2 and 7 have 4 connections. Hence, check for shared connections.
   Shared connection: 1
   Triangle formed: <2, 7, 1>

8. Edge (2, 9): Both 2 and 9 have 4 and 1 connections respectively, and 9 has fewer connections. So, proceed.
   No triangle is formed.

9. Edge (4, 6): Both 4 and 6 have 2 connections. Hence, check for shared connections.
   Shared connection: 2
   Triangle formed: <4, 6, 2>

10. Edge (5, 7): Both 5 and 7 have 2 and 4 connections respectively, and 5 has fewer connections. So, proceed.
   Shared connection: 0
   Triangle formed: <5, 7, 0>

Adding up the triangles found, the total number of triangles is [6].
