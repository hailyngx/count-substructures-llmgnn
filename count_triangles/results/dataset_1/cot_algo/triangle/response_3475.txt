Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree, from least to most connections:  

Vertices sorted by degree:  
0: 1 connections  
2: 0 connections  
7: 2 connections  
6: 2 connections  
9: 2 connections  
5: 2 connections  
1: 3 connections  
8: 4 connections  
4: 5 connections  
3: 5 connections  

Now we will relabel the vertices according to their sorted degrees.  
0 -> 0  
2 -> 1  
7 -> 2  
6 -> 3  
9 -> 4  
5 -> 5  
1 -> 6  
8 -> 7  
4 -> 8  
3 -> 9  

Now, we will examine each edge starting from the one involving the vertex with the lower label and count the triangles formed.  

Triangles found:  
<1, 3, 4>  
<3, 4, 5>  
<4, 5, 8>  
<4, 7, 8>  
<4, 6, 8>  
<5, 8, 9>  

Total number of triangles: [6]
