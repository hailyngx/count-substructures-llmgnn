Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 
(4, 6, 0, 9, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 5).

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.
Triangles: 
[16]
