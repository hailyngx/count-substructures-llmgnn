Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the order is as follows: 6, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4. 

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 has degree 2 and Vertex 5 has degree 3. Shared connections: 0-5-1 is a triangle.
2. Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has degree 2 and Vertex 8 has degree 3. No triangles are formed.
3. Edge (1, 5): Both vertices have a degree of 1. No triangles are formed.
4. Edge (2, 3): Both vertices have a degree of 5. Shared connections: 2-3-4 is a triangle.
5. Edge (2, 4): Both vertices have a degree of 5. Shared connections: 2-4-3 is a triangle.
6. Edge (3, 2): Vertex 2 has degree 5 and Vertex 3 has degree 5. No triangles are formed.
7. Edge (3, 4): Vertex 2 has degree 5 and Vertex 4 has degree 4. No triangles are formed.
8. Edge (3, 7): Vertex 2 has degree 5 and Vertex 7 has degree 4. No triangles are formed.
9. Edge (3, 8): Vertex 2 has degree 5 and Vertex 8 has degree 3. No triangles are formed.
10. Edge (3, 9): Vertex 2 has degree 5 and Vertex 9 has degree 3. No triangles are formed.
11. Edge (4, 2): Vertex 4 has degree 4 and Vertex 2 has degree 5. No triangles are formed.
12. Edge (4, 3): Vertex 4 has degree 4 and Vertex 3 has degree 5. No triangles are formed.
13. Edge (5, 0): Vertex 1 has degree 1 and Vertex 0 has degree 2. No triangles are formed.
14. Edge (5, 1): Both vertices have a degree of 1. No triangles are formed.
15. Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 has degree 3 and Vertex 9 has degree 3. No triangles are formed.
16. Edge (7, 3): Both vertices have a degree of 4. No triangles are formed.
17. Edge (7, 8): Both vertices have a degree of 4. No triangles are formed.
18. Edge (8, 0): Vertex 8 has degree 3 and Vertex 0 has degree 2. No triangles are formed.
19. Edge (8, 3): Vertex 8 has degree 3 and Vertex 2 has degree 5. No triangles are formed.
20. Edge (8, 7): Vertex 8 has degree 3 and Vertex 7 has degree 4. No triangles are formed.
21. Edge (9, 3): Vertex 9 has degree 3 and Vertex 2 has degree 5. No triangles are formed.
22. Edge (9, 5): Vertex 9 has degree 3 and Vertex 5 has degree 3. No triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 1> and <2, 3, 4>.
