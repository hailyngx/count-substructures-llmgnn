Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's order the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices from least to most connections: 5, 0, 4, 2, 6, 3, 7, 9, 8, 1

Now, we'll go through the edges and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 1): Vertices 0 and 1 share connections with vertices 6 and 7, forming two triangles: <0, 1, 6> and <0, 1, 7>.
- Edge (0, 6): Vertices 0 and 6 share connection with vertex 1, forming a triangle: <0, 6, 1>.
- Edge (0, 7): Vertices 0 and 7 do not share a connection with vertex 6, so no triangle.
- Edge (1, 0): This edge is already counted with edge (0, 1).
- Edge (1, 2): Vertices 1 and 2 do not share a connection, so no triangle.
- Edge (1, 6): This edge is already counted with edge (0, 6).
- Edge (1, 8): Vertices 1 and 8 share a connection with vertex 9, forming a triangle: <1, 8, 9>.
- Edge (1, 9): Vertices 1 and 9 share connections with vertices 2 and 8, forming two triangles: <1, 9, 2> and <1, 9, 8>.
- Edge (2, 1): This edge is already counted with edge (1, 2).
- Edge (2, 9): Vertices 2 and 9 do not share a connection, so no triangle.
- Edge (3, 7): Vertices 3 and 7 share a connection with vertex 8, forming a triangle: <3, 7, 8>.
- Edge (3, 8): Vertices 3 and 8 do not share a connection, so no triangle.
- Edge (3, 9): Vertices 3 and 9 share a connection with vertex 8, forming a triangle: <3, 9, 8>.
- Edge (4, 8): Vertices 4 and 8 do not share a connection, so no triangle.
- Edge (4, 9): Vertices 4 and 9 do not share a connection, so no triangle.
- Edge (6, 0): This edge is already counted with edge (0, 6).
- Edge (6, 1): This edge is already counted with edge (0, 6).
- Edge (7, 0): This edge is already counted with edge (0, 7).
- Edge (7, 3): This edge is already counted with edge (3, 7).
- Edge (7, 8): Vertices 7 and 8 share a connection with vertex 1, forming a triangle: <7, 8, 1>.
- Edge (8, 1): This edge is already counted with edge (1, 8).
- Edge (8, 3): This edge is already counted with edge (3, 8).
- Edge (8, 4): Vertices 8 and 4 do not share a connection, so no triangle.
- Edge (8, 7): This edge is already counted with edge (7, 8).
- Edge (8, 9): Vertices 8 and 9 share a connection with vertices 1 and 3, forming two triangles: <8, 9, 1> and <8, 9, 3>.
- Edge (9, 1): This edge is already counted with edge (1, 9).
- Edge (9, 2): Vertices 9 and 2 do not share a connection, so no triangle.
- Edge (9, 3): This edge is already counted with edge (3, 9).
- Edge (9, 4): Vertices 9 and 4 do not share a connection, so no triangle.
- Edge (9, 8): This edge is already counted with edge (8, 9).

Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 9, 2>, <1, 9, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 9, 8>, <8, 9, 3>
