Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

We will check each edge by following the degree-based ordering and count the triangles:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 0, 4>
<3, 0, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 0, 2>
<4, 3, 9>
<5, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
