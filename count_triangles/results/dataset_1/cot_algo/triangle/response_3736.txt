Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a table to track the connections for each node:

| Node | Connections |
|------|-------------|
| 0    | 1, 2, 4, 6  |
| 1    | 0, 9        |
| 2    | 0, 5        |
| 3    | 6           |
| 4    | 0, 6, 8     |
| 5    | 2, 7        |
| 6    | 0, 3, 4, 8, 9 |
| 7    | 5, 8, 9     |
| 8    | 4, 6, 7     |
| 9    | 1, 6, 7     |

Next, we sort the nodes based on the number of their connections in ascending order:

Nodes in Degree Based Order: 3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 7, 9, 4, 0, 6

Now, we count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For node 3 (6), check its connections: 6
2. For node 5 (2), check its connections: 2
3. For node 1 (0), check its connections: 0
4. For node 8 (4), check its connections: 4
5. For node 2 (0), check its connections: 0
6. For node 7 (3), check its connections: 7
   Shared connections with 5: 2
7. For node 7 (9), check its connections: 9
   Shared connections with 9: 5
   Shared connections with 8: 4
8. For node 4 (0), check its connections: 0
9. For node 0 (4), check its connections: 4
   Shared connections with 4: 6
   Shared connections with 6: 3, 4

Count of triangles = 10 [1, 7, 5, 9, 2, 0], [7, 5, 8], [7, 5, 2], [7, 9, 4], [4, 0, 6], [6, 3, 4], [6, 4, 8], [6, 4, 0], [6, 0, 2], [6, 0, 4]
