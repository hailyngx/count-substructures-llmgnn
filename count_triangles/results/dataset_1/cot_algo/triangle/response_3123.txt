Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices and their connections based on the given edges:

- Vertex 0: 4, 6
- Vertex 1: 6
- Vertex 2: 3, 8
- Vertex 3: 2, 5, 7
- Vertex 4: 0, 5
- Vertex 5: 3, 4
- Vertex 6: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Vertex 7: 3
- Vertex 8: 2, 6
- Vertex 9: 6

Now, let's sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order:

1. Vertex 1: 1 connection
2. Vertex 9: 1 connection
3. Vertex 4: 2 connections
4. Vertex 7: 2 connections
5. Vertex 2: 2 connections
6. Vertex 5: 2 connections
7. Vertex 8: 2 connections
8. Vertex 0: 2 connections
9. Vertex 3: 3 connections
10. Vertex 6: 4 connections

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- (Vertex 1, Vertex 6): No common neighbor.
- (Vertex 9, Vertex 6): No common neighbor.
- (Vertex 4, Vertex 5): Triangle <4, 5, 3>.
- (Vertex 7, Vertex 3): No common neighbor.
- (Vertex 2, Vertex 3): Triangle <2, 3, 5>.
- (Vertex 5, Vertex 3): Triangle <5, 3, 4>.
- (Vertex 8, Vertex 2): No common neighbor.
- (Vertex 0, Vertex 6): No common neighbor.
- (Vertex 0, Vertex 6): No common neighbor.

Count of triangles: [3] 

Unique triangles found: <4, 5, 3>, <2, 3, 5>, <5, 3, 4>.
