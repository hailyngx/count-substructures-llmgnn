Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 3 connections

By the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start with the vertex with the fewest connections. 
So, we will relabel the vertices as follows:
Node 0 is labeled as 0
Node 4 is labeled as 1
Node 7 is labeled as 2
Node 8 is labeled as 3
Node 2 is labeled as 4
Node 6 is labeled as 5
Node 9 is labeled as 6
Node 5 is labeled as 7
Node 1 is labeled as 8

Next, we will check each edge to see if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
Then we will count the triangles formed by shared connections.

Triangles:
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
