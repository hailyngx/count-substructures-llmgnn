Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
0 (3 connections)
1 (2 connections)
8 (3 connections)
9 (2 connections)
4 (3 connections)
7 (2 connections)
5 (2 connections)
6 (2 connections)
3 (5 connections)

Based on the method, we will iterate through each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles: 
[7]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1]. The unique triangle found is <3, 4, 8>.
