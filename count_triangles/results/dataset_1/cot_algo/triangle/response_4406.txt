Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Vertex 7 - Degree 2  
Vertex 1 - Degree 2  
Vertex 6 - Degree 1  
Vertex 9 - Degree 1  
Vertex 2 - Degree 2  
Vertex 4 - Degree 3  
Vertex 5 - Degree 3  
Vertex 8 - Degree 2  
Vertex 0 - Degree 4  
Vertex 3 - Degree 5  

Now, examining each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

<0, 3>: Shares connections with 7, 8  
<0, 7>: Shares connections with 3  
<0, 8>: Shares connections with 3  
<3, 5>: Shares connections with 0, 7  
<3, 7>: Shares connections with 0, 8  
<3, 8>: Shares connections with 5, 7  
<3, 9>: No triangles  
<1, 2>: No triangles  
<2, 4>: Shares connections with 5  
<4, 5>: Shares connections with 2  
<4, 6>: No triangles  
<5, 1>: Shares connections with 3  

Counting the total number of triangles, we find:  
[6]  

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 3, 7>  
<0, 3, 8>  
<3, 5, 7>  
<3, 5, 0>  
<3, 7, 0>  
<3, 8, 7>
