Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:  
3 (Degree: 1), 9 (Degree: 1), 6 (Degree: 2), 8 (Degree: 2), 5 (Degree: 3), 2 (Degree: 3), 7 (Degree: 4), 1 (Degree: 4), 4 (Degree: 4), 0 (Degree: 4)

Edges to consider based on the condition mentioned:
(0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 8) (5, 7)

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 6, 7>

[Total number of triangles: 4]
