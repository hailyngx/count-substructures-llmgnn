Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new ordering is as follows:
Node 4 has 1 connection
Node 3 has 2 connections
Nodes 6, 8, and 7 have 3 connections each
Nodes 2 and 1 have 4 connections each
Node 5 and 9 have 5 connections each

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. For edge (1, 2): Shared connections = None
2. For edge (1, 8): Shared connections = None
3. For edge (1, 9): Shared connections = None
4. For edge (2, 3): Shared connections = None
5. For edge (2, 7): Shared connections = 1 (Node 1)
6. For edge (3, 5): Shared connections = None
7. For edge (4, 9): Shared connections = None
8. For edge (5, 6): Shared connections = 1 (Node 7)
9. For edge (5, 7): Shared connections = 1 (Node 2)
10. For edge (5, 8): Shared connections = 1 (Node 1)
11. For edge (5, 9): Shared connections = None
12. For edge (6, 7): Shared connections = 1 (Node 5)
13. For edge (6, 9): Shared connections = None
14. For edge (7, 2): Shared connections = 1 (Node 1)
15. For edge (7, 5): Shared connections = 2 (Nodes 2 and 6)
16. For edge (7, 6): Shared connections = 1 (Node 5)
17. For edge (8, 1): Shared connections = None
18. For edge (8, 5): Shared connections = 1 (Node 1)
19. For edge (9, 4): Shared connections = None
20. For edge (9, 5): Shared connections = 1 (Node 6)
21. For edge (9, 6): Shared connections = 2 (Nodes 5 and 7)

After counting all the triangles, we find that there are a total of [5] triangles. 

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
