Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 0
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 5

Now, we will consider the edges in a way that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Looking at the edges:
(0,1), (0,4), (1,2), (1,5), (2,4), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7), (6,9), (7,8)

The triangles formed are:
<0,1,4>
<1,2,5>
<4,5,6>
<5,6,7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
