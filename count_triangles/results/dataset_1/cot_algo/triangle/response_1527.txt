Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on the number of connections:

Vertices: 
3 has 1 connection
2 has 1 connection
9 has 2 connections
7 has 2 connections
5 has 3 connections
8 has 3 connections
6 has 4 connections
1 has 4 connections
4 has 5 connections
0 has 6 connections

Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly:
3->0
2->1
9->2
7->3
5->4
8->5
6->6
1->7
4->8
0->9

Now, we check for triangles by examining each edge:

- Edge (0, 4): 9 and 8 are already connected to each other, giving us the triangle <0, 4, 8>.
- Edge (0, 5): 9 and 4 are already connected to each other, giving us the triangle <0, 4, 5>.
- Edge (0, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (0, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 4): 7 and 8 are already connected to each other, giving us the triangle <1, 4, 8>.
- Edge (1, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 8): 7 is connected to both 1 and 8, giving us the triangle <6, 1, 8>.
- Edge (7, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 8): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, and <6, 1, 8>.
