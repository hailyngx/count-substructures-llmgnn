Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
0(3), 1(1), 3(1), 4(1), 9(1), 6(2), 8(1), 5(2), 7(2), 2(2)

Relabeled vertices:
1 -> 0, 3 -> 1, 4 -> 2, 9 -> 3, 6 -> 4, 8 -> 5, 5 -> 6, 7 -> 7, 2 -> 8

Edges where vertex with lower label has fewer connections:
(1, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 7) (6, 8)

Triangles formed by shared connections:
<0, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [1]
