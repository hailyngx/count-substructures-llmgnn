Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each node in the graph:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:

- Node 3 (degree 1) -> relabeled as Node 0
- Node 4 (degree 1) -> relabeled as Node 1
- Node 6 (degree 1) -> relabeled as Node 2
- Node 7 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 3
- Node 8 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 4
- Node 9 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 5
- Node 2 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 6
- Node 5 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Node 7
- Node 0 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Node 8
- Node 1 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Node 9

Now, we go through the edges and count the number of triangles:

- Edge (0, 4): No triangle
- Edge (0, 6): No triangle
- Edge (0, 8): Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>
- Edge (1, 2): No triangle
- Edge (1, 5): No triangle
- Edge (1, 9): Triangle formed: <1, 3, 9>
- Edge (2, 7): No triangle
- Edge (3, 7): No triangle
- Edge (4, 0): No triangle
- Edge (5, 1): No triangle
- Edge (5, 8): Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>
- Edge (5, 9): No triangle
- Edge (6, 0): No triangle
- Edge (7, 2): No triangle
- Edge (7, 3): No triangle
- Edge (8, 0): Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>
- Edge (8, 5): Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>
- Edge (9, 1): Triangle formed: <1, 3, 9>
- Edge (9, 5): No triangle

Count of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
- <0, 5, 8>
- <1, 3, 9>
