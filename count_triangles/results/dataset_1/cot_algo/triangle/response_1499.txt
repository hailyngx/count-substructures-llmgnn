Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 4 -- 5
|\    |\
| \   | 9
|  7- 6
1 -- 2 -- 3
  \
   8
```

After reordering the vertices based on their degrees, the new vertex labels will be: 
0 -> 3  
1 -> 3  
2 -> 4  
3 -> 5  
4 -> 5  
5 -> 3  
6 -> 4  
7 -> 4  
8 -> 2  
9 -> 5  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles, we find the total number of triangles to be 4 and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <3, 4, 5>.

Therefore, the output will be:  
[4]
