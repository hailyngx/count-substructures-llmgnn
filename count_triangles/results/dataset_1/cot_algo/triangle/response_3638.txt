Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their connections:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

We will proceed by examining each edge and counting the triangles formed. Only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections will be considered.

After examining all edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 0>
<2, 8, 6>
<4, 7, 6>
<5, 8, 6>
<6, 7, 4>
