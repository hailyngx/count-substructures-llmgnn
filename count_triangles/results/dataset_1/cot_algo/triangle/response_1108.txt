Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to label the nodes based on the number of connections they have:

0: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
9: 1 connection
8: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
3: 5 connections

Now, we will iterate over each edge starting from the one involving the lower labeled vertex with fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 3) - both nodes have 2 common neighbors (8, 3), forming a triangle with node 8.
2. Edge (0, 8) - both nodes have 2 common neighbors (3, 8), forming a triangle with node 3.
3. Edge (2, 3) - both nodes have 2 common neighbors (5, 6), forming a triangle with node 5.
4. Edge (2, 5) - both nodes have 2 common neighbors (3, 6), forming a triangle with node 3.
5. Edge (3, 6) - both nodes have 2 common neighbors (2, 5), forming a triangle with node 2.

After considering all edges, we have found 5 unique triangles: <0, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
