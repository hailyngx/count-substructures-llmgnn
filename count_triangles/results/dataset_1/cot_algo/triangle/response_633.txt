Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0 has 1 connection  
Node 7 has 1 connection  
Node 9 has 1 connection  
Node 2 has 2 connections  
Node 8 has 2 connections  
Node 6 has 3 connections  
Node 5 has 3 connections  
Node 1 has 4 connections  
Node 4 has 4 connections  
Node 3 has 4 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges:

1. Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with node 1: <0, 1, 5>
2. Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 1, 5>
3. Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle with node 5: <1, 5, 6>
4. Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle.
8. Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with node 2: <2, 3, 4>
9. Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle.
11. Edge (4, 3) forms a triangle with node 2: <2, 3, 4>
12. Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
13. Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle.
14. Edge (5, 1) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 1, 5>
15. Edge (5, 6) forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 5, 6>
16. Edge (6, 1) forms a triangle with node 5: <1, 5, 6>
17. Edge (6, 5) forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 5, 6>
18. Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
19. Edge (7, 1) does not form a triangle.
20. Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.
21. Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle.
22. Edge (9, 3) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 4>.
