Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 1 has degree 1
- Vertex 3 has degree 3
- Vertex 6 has degree 2
- Vertex 7 has degree 3
- Vertex 5 has degree 4
- Vertex 8 has degree 2
- Vertex 4 has degree 4
- Vertex 2 has degree 5
- Vertex 9 has degree 6

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:

- Vertex 1 (degree 1) will be relabeled as 0
- Vertex 0 (degree 2) will be relabeled as 1
- Vertex 6 (degree 2) will be relabeled as 2
- Vertex 8 (degree 2) will be relabeled as 3
- Vertex 3 (degree 3) will be relabeled as 4
- Vertex 7 (degree 3) will be relabeled as 5
- Vertex 4 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 6
- Vertex 5 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 7
- Vertex 2 (degree 5) will be relabeled as 8
- Vertex 9 (degree 6) will be relabeled as 9

Now, we will count the triangles by looking at the edges while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 6, 4>
- Triangle <1, 7, 4>
- Triangle <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle <3, 9, 4>
- Triangle <3, 9, 7>
- Triangle <3, 9, 5>
- Triangle <4, 5, 9>
- Triangle <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
