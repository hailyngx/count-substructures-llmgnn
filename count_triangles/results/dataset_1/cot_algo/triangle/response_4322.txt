Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections, we get the following order: 
0 < 1 < 3 < 8 < 5 < 9 < 4 < 6 < 2 < 7
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles by examining each edge. 

Triangles:
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
