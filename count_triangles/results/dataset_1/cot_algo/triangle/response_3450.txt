Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After applying Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph:

Nodes sorted by their degree (number of connections):
0 (degree 3), 6 (degree 2), 8 (degree 2), 2 (degree 2), 4 (degree 3), 5 (degree 3), 1 (degree 4), 9 (degree 5), 7 (degree 4), 3 (degree 4)

Sorted edges based on node labels:
(1, 2), (1, 4), (4, 5), (7, 9), (9, 6), (0, 3), (7, 0), (8, 2), (9, 5), (7, 1), (7, 4), (5, 9), (9, 7), (0, 6), (3, 5), (3, 9), (0, 7), (8, 1), (2, 8), (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 4), (9, 3), (5, 3), (6, 9), (1, 7), (1, 8), (6, 0), (7, 4)

Now, let's count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 0, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<7, 0, 1>
<7, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 6>
<5, 9, 3>
