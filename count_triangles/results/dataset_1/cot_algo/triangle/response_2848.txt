Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following labels for each vertex:

0: 2 connections 
1: 3 connections 
2: 3 connections 
3: 2 connections 
4: 2 connections 
5: 6 connections 
6: 3 connections 
7: 3 connections 
8: 3 connections 
9: 3 connections 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now analyze the edges. 
Looking at edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 8): Both 0 and 8 have 2 connections, so we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 5, forming triangle <0, 5, 8>.
2. Edge (1, 2): Both 1 and 2 have 3 connections, so we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 5, forming triangle <1, 2, 5>.
3. Edge (3, 6): Both 3 and 6 have 2 connections, so we proceed. They do not share any connections, so no triangle is formed.
4. Edge (4, 9): Both 4 and 9 have 3 connections, so we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 5, forming triangle <4, 5, 9>.
5. Edge (5, 6): Vertex 6 has fewer connections than 5, so we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 3, forming triangle <3, 5, 6>.
6. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 7 has fewer connections than 5, so we proceed. They do not share any connections, so no triangle is formed.
7. Edge (5, 8): Vertex 8 has fewer connections than 5, so we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 5, 8>.
8. Edge (5, 9): Vertex 9 has fewer connections than 5, so we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 4, forming triangle <4, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <4, 5, 9>.
