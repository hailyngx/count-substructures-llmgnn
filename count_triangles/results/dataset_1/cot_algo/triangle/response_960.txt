Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of vertices is as follows:
Node 1 has 1 connection.
Node 0 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.
Node 8 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 8): Check shared connections with node 8 (5, 6, 7).
2. Edge (1, 2): Check shared connection with node 2 (9).
3. Edge (1, 9): No triangle found.
4. Edge (2, 1): No triangle found.
5. Edge (2, 9): Check shared connection with node 9 (3).
6. Edge (3, 4): No triangle found.
7. Edge (3, 6): Check shared connection with node 6 (8).
8. Edge (3, 9): Check shared connections with node 9 (7, 8).
9. Edge (4, 3): No triangle found.
10. Edge (5, 7): No triangle found.
11. Edge (5, 8): Check shared connection with node 8 (0).
12. Edge (6, 3): Check shared connection with node 3 (9).
13. Edge (6, 8): Check shared connections with node 8 (0, 7).
14. Edge (7, 5): No triangle found.
15. Edge (7, 8): Check shared connections with node 8 (0, 6).
16. Edge (7, 9): Check shared connections with node 9 (2, 3).
17. Edge (8, 0): No triangle found.
18. Edge (8, 5): Check shared connection with node 5 (7).
19. Edge (8, 6): Check shared connection with node 6 (3).
20. Edge (8, 7): No triangle found.
21. Edge (8, 9): Check shared connection with node 9 (1).
22. Edge (9, 1): No triangle found.
23. Edge (9, 2): Check shared connection with node 2 (1).
24. Edge (9, 3): Check shared connection with node 3 (6).
25. Edge (9, 7): No triangle found.
26. Edge (9, 8): Check shared connection with node 8 (2).

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles:
