Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections

Now, we will label the vertices accordingly:
Node 1 --> 0
Node 5 --> 1
Node 8 --> 2
Node 9 --> 3
Node 6 --> 4
Node 2 --> 5
Node 3 --> 6
Node 7 --> 7
Node 4 --> 8
Node 0 --> 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:
For each edge, we will only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
Checking the edges:
(0, 1) - Proceed (Node 0 has more connections)
(0, 2) - Proceed (Node 0 has more connections)
(0, 4) - Proceed (Node 0 has more connections)
(0, 7) - Proceed (Node 0 has more connections)
(0, 9) - Proceed (Node 0 has more connections)
(1, 5) - Proceed (Node 1 has fewer connections)
(2, 4) - Proceed (Node 2 has fewer connections)
(3, 7) - Proceed (Node 3 has fewer connections)
(6, 5) - Proceed (Node 5 has fewer connections)
(6, 8) - Proceed (Node 6 has fewer connections)
(9, 3) - Proceed (Node 3 has fewer connections)

Counting the triangles, we find:
[Total number of triangles: 3]
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 7, 9>
