Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 3 connections

Now, relabeling the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0 < Node 3 < Node 5 < Node 7 < Node 1 < Node 2 < Node 8 < Node 4 < Node 6

Next, we go through each edge considering the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 8) is considered
- Edge (1, 4) is considered
- Edge (1, 6) is considered
- Edge (2, 4) is considered
- Edge (2, 6) is considered
- Edge (3, 6) is considered
- Edge (4, 1) is considered
- Edge (4, 2) is considered
- Edge (4, 5) is skipped (Node 4 has more connections than Node 5)
- Edge (4, 6) is considered
- Edge (4, 7) is considered
- Edge (6, 1) is considered
- Edge (6, 2) is considered
- Edge (6, 3) is considered
- Edge (6, 4) is considered
- Edge (6, 8) is skipped (Node 6 has more connections than Node 8)
- Edge (7, 4) is considered
- Edge (8, 0) is considered
- Edge (8, 6) is skipped (Node 8 has more connections than Node 6)

Counting the triangles formed from shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following unique triangles:

<2, 6, 4>
<4, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
