Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, we get the following labels:
Node 0 - 1 connection
Node 1 - 1 connection
Node 5 - 1 connection
Node 8 - 1 connection
Node 6 - 2 connections
Node 9 - 2 connections
Node 7 - 3 connections
Node 2 - 4 connections
Node 3 - 4 connections
Node 4 - 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider edges only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles formed:
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
