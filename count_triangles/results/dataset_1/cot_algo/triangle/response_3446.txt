Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

0 (degree 1), 2 (degree 1), 5 (degree 1), 9 (degree 1),
3 (degree 2), 7 (degree 2),
5 (degree 3), 6 (degree 4), 4 (degree 4),
1 (degree 5), 8 (degree 8).

Starting with the vertex with the lowest degree:
- Node 0 is connected to node 8 forming a triangle <0, 8, x> with x being either 1 or 3, but both vertices have higher degrees than 0.
- Node 2 is connected to node 9, but they do not form a triangle with any other vertex.
- Node 5 is connected to node 3 but they do not form a triangle.
- Node 9 and node 2 do not form a triangle.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to node 5 but they do not form a triangle.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to node 1 forming a triangle <1, 7, x> with x being either 4 or 8, but they have higher degrees.
- Node 7 is connected to node 8 forming a triangle <7, 8, 1>.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to node 3, they do not form a triangle.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to node 1 forming a triangle <1, 6, 4> and a triangle <1, 6, 8>.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4 forming a triangle <4, 6, 1> and a triangle <4, 6, 8>.
- Node 6 is connected to node 8, they form a triangle <6, 8, 1> and a triangle <6, 8, 4>.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to node 1, they do not form a triangle.
- Node 4 is connected to node 6, they do not form a triangle.*
- Node 4 is connected to node 8 forming a triangle <4, 8, 1> and a triangle <4, 8, 6>.

For node 1:
- Node 1 and node 7 form a triangle <1, 7, 8>.
- Node 1 and node 6 form a triangle <1, 6, 8>.
- Node 1 and node 4 do not form a triangle.
- Node 1 and node 8 form a triangle <1, 8, 6> and a triangle <1, 8, 4>.

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to node 0, they do not form a triangle.
- Node 8 and node 1, 4, 6, and 7 form triangles as calculated above.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
