Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling of the vertices is: 

Vertices: 
0 (Degree: 3)
1 (Degree: 2)
5 (Degree: 2)
6 (Degree: 2)
8 (Degree: 3)
2 (Degree: 3)
4 (Degree: 2)
3 (Degree: 5)
7 (Degree: 5)
9 (Degree: 6)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the triangles using the given edges:

Triangles: 
[33]
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 6>
<3, 8, 9>
<3, 9, 5>
<3, 9, 7>
