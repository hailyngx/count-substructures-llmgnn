Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 1 (degree 1)
- Node 4 (degree 1)
- Node 6 (degree 1)
- Node 7 (degree 2)
- Node 8 (degree 2)
- Node 0 (degree 4)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 2 (degree 5)
- Node 5 (degree 5)
- Node 9 (degree 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 4: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle 6: <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle 7: <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle 8: <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
