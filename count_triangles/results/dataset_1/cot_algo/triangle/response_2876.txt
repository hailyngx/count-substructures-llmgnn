Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine each edge while considering the lower labeled vertex. 

Triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
