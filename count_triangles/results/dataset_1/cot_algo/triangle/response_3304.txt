Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:  
Node 0 (Degree 3)  
Node 6 (Degree 1)  
Node 5 (Degree 2)    
Node 3 (Degree 2)    
Node 9 (Degree 2)    
Node 2 (Degree 4)    
Node 1 (Degree 4)    
Node 8 (Degree 4)    
Node 4 (Degree 5)    
Node 7 (Degree 6)    

The triangles formed by the shared connections are as follows:  
<0, 1, 7>  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 2, 7>  
<1, 2, 4>  
<1, 2, 8>  
<1, 4, 7>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<2, 4, 8>  
<4, 7, 8>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
