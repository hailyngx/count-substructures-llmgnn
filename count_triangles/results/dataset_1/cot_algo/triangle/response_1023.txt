Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting vertices by their number of connections, we get the following relabeling: 
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 8: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 7
Node 2: Degree 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting the triangles: 
- Considering edge (0, 1): Node 0 has less connections than Node 1, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- Considering edge (0, 2): Node 0 has less connections than Node 2, forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- Considering edge (0, 4): Node 0 has less connections than Node 4, forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- Considering edge (1, 3): Node 1 has less connections than Node 3, no triangles formed.
- Considering edge (1, 5): Node 1 has less connections than Node 5, no triangles formed.
- Considering edge (1, 8): Node 1 has less connections than Node 8, forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.
- Considering edge (1, 9): Node 1 has less connections than Node 9, no triangles formed.
- Considering edge (2, 4): Node 2 has less connections than Node 4, forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- Considering edge (2, 6): Node 2 has less connections than Node 6, forming a triangle <0, 2, 6>.
- Considering edge (2, 7): Node 2 has less connections than Node 7, forming a triangle <0, 2, 7>.
- Considering edge (2, 8): Node 2 has less connections than Node 8, forming a triangle <0, 2, 8>.
- Considering edge (2, 9): Node 2 has less connections than Node 9, forming a triangle <0, 2, 9>.
- Considering edge (3, 1): Node 3 has less connections than Node 1, no triangles formed.
- Considering edge (4, 5): Node 4 has less connections than Node 5, forming a triangle <0, 4, 5>.
- Considering edge (4, 8): Node 4 has less connections than Node 8, forming a triangle <0, 4, 8>.
- Considering edge (4, 9): Node 4 has less connections than Node 9, forming a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
- Considering edge (5, 4): Node 5 has less connections than Node 4, no triangles formed.
- Considering edge (6, 8): Node 6 has less connections than Node 8, forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
- Considering edge (6, 9): Node 6 has less connections than Node 9, forming a triangle <0, 6, 9>.
- Considering edge (7, 2): Node 7 has less connections than Node 2, no triangles formed.
- Considering edge (8, 1): Node 8 has less connections than Node 1, no triangles formed.
- Considering edge (8, 4): Node 8 has less connections than Node 4, forming a triangle <0, 4, 8>.
- Considering edge (8, 6): Node 8 has less connections than Node 6, forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
- Considering edge (9, 1): Node 9 has less connections than Node 1, no triangles formed.
- Considering edge (9, 2): Node 9 has less connections than Node 2, no triangles formed.
- Considering edge (9, 4): Node 9 has less connections than Node 4, forming a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
- Considering edge (9, 6): Node 9 has less connections than Node 6, forming a triangle <0, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
