Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 5: degree 0
Node 3: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:
