Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the sorted vertices:

1. Checking edge (0, 5): No triangles as both nodes have 1 connection.
2. Checking edge (1, 5): No triangles as both nodes have 4 connections.
3. Checking edge (1, 7): No triangles as both nodes have 4 connections.
4. Checking edge (1, 9): Triangle found: <1, 3, 9>.
5. Checking edge (2, 3): No triangles as both nodes have 4 connections.
6. Checking edge (2, 6): No triangles as both nodes have 1 connection.
7. Checking edge (2, 7): Triangle found: <2, 1, 7>.
8. Checking edge (3, 2): No triangles as both nodes have 4 connections.
9. Checking edge (3, 4): No triangles as both nodes have 2 connections.
10. Checking edge (3, 9): Triangle found: <3, 1, 9>.
11. Checking edge (4, 3): No triangles as both nodes have 5 connections.
12. Checking edge (4, 8): No triangles as both nodes have 1 connection.
13. Checking edge (5, 0): No triangles as both nodes have 3 connections.
14. Checking edge (5, 1): Triangle found: <5, 1, 9>.
15. Checking edge (5, 9): No triangles as both nodes have 4 connections.
16. Checking edge (6, 2): No triangles as both nodes have 4 connections.
17. Checking edge (7, 1): Triangle found: <7, 1, 9>.
18. Checking edge (7, 2): No triangles as both nodes have 4 connections.
19. Checking edge (8, 4): No triangles as both nodes have 2 connections.
20. Checking edge (9, 1): Triangle found: <9, 1, 7>.
21. Checking edge (9, 3): Triangle found: <9, 3, 1>.
22. Checking edge (9, 5): No triangles as both nodes have 3 connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
