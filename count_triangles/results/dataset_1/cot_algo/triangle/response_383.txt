Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 4

Relabeling the nodes based on degree in ascending order:

Node 0 -> degree 2
Node 3 -> degree 3
Node 4 -> degree 3
Node 5 -> degree 3
Node 6 -> degree 3
Node 7 -> degree 3
Node 8 -> degree 3
Node 1 -> degree 4
Node 2 -> degree 4
Node 9 -> degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For edges (0, 3) and (0, 4), we check for triangles: 0-3-4
- For edges (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 8), and (1, 9), we check for triangles: 1-2-4, 1-4-9, 1-8-9
- For edges (3, 4) and (3, 5), we check for triangles: 3-4-5
- For edges (5, 7) and (5, 9), we check for triangles: 5-7-9
- For edges (6, 8), (6, 9), and (8, 9), we check for triangles: 6-8-9

This gives us a total of 6 triangles: <0, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <5, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
