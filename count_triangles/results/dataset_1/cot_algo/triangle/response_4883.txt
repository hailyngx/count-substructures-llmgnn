Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be:
0 -> 1
1 -> 4
2 -> 2
3 -> 3
4 -> 5
5 -> 6
6 -> 7
7 -> 8
8 -> 9
9 -> 0

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

Number of triangles: [20]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 9, 7>
