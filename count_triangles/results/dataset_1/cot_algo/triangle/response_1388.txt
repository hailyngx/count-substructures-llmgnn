Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes by their degrees, we have:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Following the degree-based ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:

(0, 7) -> Forms 0 triangles
(1, 3) -> Forms 0 triangles
(1, 4) -> Forms 1 triangle: <1, 3, 4>
(1, 5) -> Forms 1 triangle: <1, 3, 5>
(2, 4) -> Forms 0 triangles
(3, 1) -> Forms 0 triangles
(3, 5) -> Forms 1 triangle: <3, 1, 5>
(4, 1) -> Forms 1 triangle: <4, 1, 5>
(4, 2) -> Forms 0 triangles
(4, 8) -> Forms 2 triangles: <4, 1, 8>, <4, 9, 8> 
(4, 9) -> Forms 1 triangle: <4, 1, 9>
(5, 1) -> Forms 1 triangle: <5, 1, 3>
(5, 3) -> Forms 1 triangle: <5, 1, 3>
(6, 7) -> Forms 1 triangle: <6, 0, 7>
(7, 0) -> Forms 1 triangle: <7, 0, 6>
(7, 6) -> Forms 1 triangle: <7, 0, 6>
(8, 4) -> Forms 2 triangles: <8, 4, 1>, <8, 4, 9>
(9, 4) -> Forms 1 triangle: <9, 4, 1>

Total Number of Triangles: [11]
Unique Triangles: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <3, 1, 5>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 1, 8>, <4, 9, 8>, <4, 1, 9>, <5, 1, 3>, <6, 0, 7>, <7, 0, 6>, <8, 4, 1>, <8, 4, 9>
