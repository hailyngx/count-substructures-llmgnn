Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the nodes are:  
Node 0 -> 3 connections  
Node 3 -> 3 connections  
Node 7 -> 3 connections  
Node 6 -> 4 connections  
Node 5 -> 4 connections  
Node 9 -> 4 connections  
Node 2 -> 5 connections  
Node 8 -> 5 connections  
Node 4 -> 6 connections  
Node 1 -> 8 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:  

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>  
2. Triangle <0, 1, 3>  
3. Triangle <0, 1, 4>  
4. Triangle <1, 2, 4>  
5. Triangle <1, 2, 6>  
6. Triangle <1, 2, 9>  
7. Triangle <1, 3, 0>  
8. Triangle <1, 4, 2>  
9. Triangle <1, 4, 5>  
10. Triangle <1, 4, 6>  
11. Triangle <1, 4, 8>  
12. Triangle <1, 5, 4>  
13. Triangle <1, 5, 7>  
14. Triangle <1, 5, 8>  
15. Triangle <1, 6, 2>  
16. Triangle <1, 6, 4>  
17. Triangle <1, 6, 8>  
18. Triangle <1, 8, 4>  
19. Triangle <1, 8, 5>  
20. Triangle <1, 8, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
