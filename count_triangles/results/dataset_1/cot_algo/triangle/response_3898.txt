Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  

Vertex 5: 0 connections  
Vertices 1, 5: 1 connection  
Vertices 2, 6, 8: 2 connections  
Vertices 3, 4: 3 connections  
Vertices 0, 9: 4 connections  
Vertices 7: 5 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Checking edge (0, 2): They both have 4 connections, so skip.  
Checking edge (0, 4): They both have 4 connections, so skip.  
Checking edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 has 4 connections, which is fewer than the 5 connections of vertex 7.  
Vertex 0 shares connections with vertices 2 and 4, forming triangles <0, 2, 4> and <0, 4, 7>.  

Checking edge (0, 9): They both have 4 connections, so skip.  
Checking edge (1, 4): They both have 1 connection, so skip.  
Checking edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has 1 connection, which is fewer than the 2 connections of vertex 8.  
Vertex 1 shares a connection with vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 1, 8>.  

Checking edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 has 1 connection, which is fewer than the 4 connections of vertex 9.  
Vertex 1 shares a connection with vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 1, 9>.  

Checking edge (2, 3): They both have 2 connections, so skip.  
Checking edge (2, 6): They both have 2 connections, so skip.  
Checking edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has 2 connections, which is fewer than the 4 connections of vertex 9.  
Vertex 2 shares connections with vertices 0 and 6, forming triangle <0, 2, 9> and <2, 6, 9>.  

Checking edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 has 3 connections, which is fewer than the 2 connections of vertex 6.  
Vertex 3 shares connections with vertices 2 and 7, forming triangle <2, 3, 7>.  

Checking edge (3, 7): Vertex 3 has 3 connections, which is fewer than the 5 connections of vertex 7.  
Vertex 3 shares a connection with vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 3, 7>.  

Checking edge (4, 7): They both have 3 connections, so skip.  
Checking edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 has 2 connections, which is fewer than the 4 connections of vertex 9.  
Vertex 6 shares a connection with vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 6, 9>.  

Checking edge (7, 8): Vertex 7 has 5 connections, which is fewer than the 2 connections of vertex 8.  
Vertex 7 shares a connection with vertex 1, forming triangle <1, 7, 8>.  

Checking edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has 5 connections, which is fewer than the 4 connections of vertex 9.  
Vertex 7 shares connections with vertices 0 and 6, forming triangle <0, 7, 9> and <6, 7, 9>.
