Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new vertex labels are: 
Vertices: 0(3), 1(3), 2(0), 3(3), 4(3), 5(4), 6(1), 7(0), 8(3), 9(3)

Calculating the total number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges: 
1. Edge (0, 1): Shared connections with vertex 5 form triangle <0, 1, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (0, 9): Shared connections with vertex 3 form triangle <0, 3, 9>.
4. Edge (1, 0): Already counted.
5. Edge (1, 5): Already counted.
6. Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (3, 4): Shared connections with vertex 8 form triangle <3, 4, 8>.
8. Edge (3, 8): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (4, 3): Already counted.
11. Edge (4, 5): Shared connections with vertex 8 form triangle <4, 5, 8>.
12. Edge (4, 6): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (5, 0): Already counted.
14. Edge (5, 1): Already counted.
15. Edge (5, 4): Already counted.
16. Edge (5, 8): Shared connections with vertex 1 form triangle <1, 5, 8>.
17. Edge (6, 4): No triangles formed.
18. Edge (8, 1): Already counted.
19. Edge (8, 3): Already counted.
20. Edge (8, 5): Already counted.
21. Edge (9, 0): Already counted.
22. Edge (9, 3): Already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 8>.
