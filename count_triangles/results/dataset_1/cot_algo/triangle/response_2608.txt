Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees from least to most, the new labeling of the nodes is: 2, 6, 5, 9, 7, 1,  4, 0, 8, 3.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

Calculating the triangles:
- Triangle <3, 0, 8>
- Triangle <3, 1, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
