Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. So, we will explore the following edges:

(0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8)
(2, 3) (2, 7)
(5, 3)
(7, 1) (7, 9)

Now, we will check for shared connections between the vertices of each edge to count the triangles. 

The triangles in this graph are: 
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 5, 3>
3. <2, 3, 4>
4. <2, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
