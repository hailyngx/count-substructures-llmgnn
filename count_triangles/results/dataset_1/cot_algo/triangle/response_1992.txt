Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes according to their degrees:
- Node 1 (degree 2) becomes Node 0
- Node 7 (degree 2) becomes Node 1
- Node 0 (degree 3) becomes Node 2
- Node 2 (degree 3) becomes Node 3
- Node 4 (degree 3) becomes Node 4
- Node 1 (degree 2) becomes Node 5
- Node 6 (degree 4) becomes Node 6
- Node 3 (degree 4) becomes Node 7
- Node 8 (degree 4) becomes Node 8
- Node 9 (degree 4) becomes Node 9

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

- For edge (0, 1): No triangle.
- For edge (0, 2): Forms a triangle <0, 2, 3>.
- For edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle <0, 4, 6>.
- For edge (1, 2): No triangle.
- For edge (2, 3): Forms a triangle <3, 2, 7>.
- For edge (3, 6): Forms a triangle <6, 3, 7>.
- For edge (3, 7): No triangle.
- For edge (3, 8): No triangle.
- For edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle <4, 6, 9>.
- For edge (6, 9): Forms a triangle <6, 9, 8>.

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles found:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <3, 2, 7>
- <6, 9, 8>
