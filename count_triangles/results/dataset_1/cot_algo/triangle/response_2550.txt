Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following relabeling: 
Node 0 has 4 connections 
Node 3 has 2 connections
Node 5 has 2 connections
Node 7 has 2 connections
Node 6 has 3 connections
Node 2 has 4 connections
Node 8 has 4 connections
Node 1 has 6 connections
Node 4 has 4 connections
Node 9 has 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles: 

1. Edge (0, 1): Nodes 0 and 1 have 4 and 6 connections respectively. No triangles are formed.
2. Edge (0, 8): Nodes 0 and 8 have 4 and 4 connections respectively. No triangles are formed.
3. Edge (0, 9): Nodes 0 and 9 have 4 and 7 connections respectively. Forming triangle <0, 9, 4>.
4. Edge (1, 3): Nodes 1 and 3 have 6 and 2 connections respectively. Forming triangle <1, 3, 4>.
5. Edge (1, 4): Nodes 1 and 4 have 6 and 4 connections respectively. Forming triangle <1, 4, 9>.
6. Edge (1, 6): Nodes 1 and 6 have 6 and 3 connections respectively. No triangles are formed.
7. Edge (1, 8): Nodes 1 and 8 have 6 and 4 connections respectively. Forming triangle <1, 8, 2>.
8. Edge (2, 5): Nodes 2 and 5 have 4 and 2 connections respectively. No triangles are formed.
9. Edge (2, 7): Nodes 2 and 7 have 4 and 2 connections respectively. No triangles are formed.
10. Edge (2, 8): Nodes 2 and 8 have 4 and 4 connections respectively. Forming triangle <2, 8, 1>.
11. Edge (2, 9): Nodes 2 and 9 have 4 and 7 connections respectively. Forming triangle <2, 9, 0>.
12. Edge (3, 4): Nodes 3 and 4 have 2 and 4 connections respectively. Forming triangle <3, 4, 9>.
13. Edge (4, 9): Nodes 4 and 9 have 4 and 7 connections respectively. Forming triangle <4, 9, 0>.
14. Edge (5, 9): Nodes 5 and 9 have 2 and 7 connections respectively. No triangles are formed.
15. Edge (6, 9): Nodes 6 and 9 have 3 and 7 connections respectively. Forming triangle <6, 9, 0>.
16. Edge (7, 9): Nodes 7 and 9 have 2 and 7 connections respectively. No triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 9, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 8, 2>, <2, 8, 1>, <2, 9, 0>, and <3, 4, 9>, <4, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 0>.
