Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then re-labeling them accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows:
0 (degree 2), 1 (degree 2), 6 (degree 2), 7 (degree 2), 9 (degree 3), 2 (degree 3), 5 (degree 3), 8 (degree 4), 3 (degree 4), 4 (degree 9)

After re-labeling the vertices, the new list is:
0 (degree 2), 1 (degree 2), 2 (degree 3), 3 (degree 4), 4 (degree 9), 5 (degree 3), 6 (degree 2), 7 (degree 2), 8 (degree 4), 9 (degree 3)

Following the degree-based ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Analyzing the edges based on the re-labeled vertices, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
