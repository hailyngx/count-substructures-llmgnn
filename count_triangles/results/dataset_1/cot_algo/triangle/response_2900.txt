Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
Vertices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Degrees: 2 3 1 3 2 2 4 2 2 2

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 2 0 4 8 5 9 1 6 7 3

Now we can go through each edge and count the triangles:
(0, 5): No triangle
(1, 3): No triangle
(1, 7): No triangle
(1, 9): No triangle
(2, 8): No triangle
(3, 1): No triangle
(3, 8): No triangle
(3, 9): No triangle
(4, 6): No triangle
(5, 0): No triangle
(5, 6): No triangle
(6, 4): No triangle
(6, 5): No triangle
(6, 7): Found a triangle <1, 3, 7>
(7, 1): No triangle
(7, 6): Found a triangle <1, 3, 7>
(8, 2): No triangle
(8, 3): No triangle
(9, 1): No triangle
(9, 3): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [2]
