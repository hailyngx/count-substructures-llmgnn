Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 4, 0, 1, 9, 8, 5, 2, 5, 3, 8

Calculating triangles:
For edge (0, 3): Shared connection with vertex 5. Triangle <0, 3, 5>.
For edge (1, 6): No triangles.
For edge (2, 5): Shared connection with vertices 3 and 7. Triangles <2, 5, 3> and <2, 5, 7>.
For edge (2, 7): Shared connection with vertices 3. Triangle <2, 7, 3>.
For edge (2, 9): No triangles.
For edge (3, 5): Shared connection with vertex 7. Triangle <3, 5, 7>.
For edge (3, 7): No triangles.
For edge (4, 5): No triangles.
For edge (5, 6): No triangles.
For edge (5, 6): Shared connection with vertices 1 and 7. Triangle <5, 6, 1> and <5, 6, 7>.
For edge (6, 1): Shared connection with vertex 5. Triangle <6, 1, 5>.
For edge (6, 7): Shared connection with vertex 5. Triangle <6, 7, 5>.
For edge (6, 9): No triangles.
For edge (7, 2): No triangles.
For edge (7, 3): No triangles.
For edge (7, 6): Shared connection with vertex 5. Triangle <7, 6, 5>.
For edge (9, 2): No triangles.
For edge (9, 6): No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 3>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 7>
