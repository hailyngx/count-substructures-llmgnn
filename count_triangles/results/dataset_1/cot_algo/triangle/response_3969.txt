Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given graph with nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and edges:
(0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 6)

First, we sort the nodes based on their degrees:
0 (1), 8 (1), 6 (2), 1 (3), 8 (3), 9 (3), 6 (3), 0 (3), 4 (4), 3 (5)

Next, we proceed with counting the triangles:
- Edge (0, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) forms triangle <1, 3, 4>.
- Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 3) forms triangle <1, 3, 4>.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 4>.
