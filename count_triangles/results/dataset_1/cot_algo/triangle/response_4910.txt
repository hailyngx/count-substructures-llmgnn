Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Vertices in increasing order of connections: 4, 7, 8, 3, 1, 0, 7, 6, 2, 5

Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
Edges with valid ordering: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 9), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9)

Count of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 9, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>
