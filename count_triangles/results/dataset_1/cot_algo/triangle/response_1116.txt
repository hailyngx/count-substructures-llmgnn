Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph, we can count the number of triangles it contains. The sorted vertices with their respective degrees are as follows:

Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections

Following the method, we find the triangles as below:

[9, 8, 6]
[9, 8, 4]
[9, 8, 6]
[9, 4, 6]
[8, 6, 4]
[7, 5, 3]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <9, 8, 6>, <9, 8, 4>, <7, 5, 3>.
