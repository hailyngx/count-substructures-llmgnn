Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 6 has the fewest connections (degree 3)  
Node 1 and Node 4 have the next fewest connections (degree 4)  
Node 2, Node 7, and Node 8 have the next fewest connections (degree 5)  
Node 5 has the next fewest connections (degree 6)  
Node 0 and Node 3 have the most connections (degree 7)  

Using the order of nodes (6, 1, 4, 2, 7, 8, 5, 0, 3, 9), we check the edges in that order.

- Node 6: No triangles
- Node 1: No triangles
- Node 4: No triangles
- Node 2: No triangles
- Node 7: No triangles
- Node 8: No triangles
- Node 5: No triangles
- Node 0: Found triangles: <0, 3, 5> <0, 5, 9> 
- Node 3: Found triangles: <0, 3, 5> <0, 3, 8> <3, 5, 9>  

Total number of triangles: [5]
