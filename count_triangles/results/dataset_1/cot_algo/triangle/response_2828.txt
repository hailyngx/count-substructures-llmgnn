Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 5) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Vertex 1 (0) has 2 connections
- Vertex 6 (2) has 1 connection
- Vertex 0 (3) has 5 connections
- Vertex 7 (4) has 1 connection
- Vertex 9 (5) has 3 connections
- Vertex 8 (7) has 1 connection
- Vertex 5 (8) has 1 connection
- Vertex 4 (4) has 1 connection
- Vertex 3 (8) has 1 connection
- Vertex 2 (4) has 1 connection

Now, we will relabel the vertices: 0 → 1, 2 → 2, 3 → 0, 5 → 3, 8 → 4, 7 → 5, 4 → 6, 9 → 7, 6 → 8, 1 → 9

Now, let's go through the edges and count the triangles:
(0, 3): Vertex 0 (3) has 5 connections and Vertex 3 (0) has 5 connections, so both have fewer connections than the other. They share the connections 7 and 2, forming the triangle <0, 3, 5>.
(2, 3): Proceeding as in the previous step, we find the triangle <0, 3, 5>.
(3, 0): This edge was already counted in the previous step.
(3, 2): Proceeding, we find another triangle <0, 3, 5>.
(3, 5): Proceeding, we find another triangle <0, 3, 5>.
(4, 8): Vertex 4 (6) has 1 connection and Vertex 8 (4) has 1 connection, forming the triangle <4, 8, 5>.
(5, 3): This edge was already counted in a previous step.
(5, 7): Vertex 5 (8) has 1 connection and Vertex 7 (5) has 1 connection, forming the triangle <4, 5, 7>.
(7, 5): This edge was already counted in a previous step.
(8, 4): This edge was already counted in a previous step.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5> and <4, 8, 5>.
