Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method first requires sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted order for the given graph is as follows: 

Node 1 -> Connections: 2
Node 5 -> Connections: 2
Node 6 -> Connections: 2
Node 4 -> Connections: 2
Node 9 -> Connections: 3
Node 8 -> Connections: 3
Node 3 -> Connections: 4
Node 2 -> Connections: 4
Node 7 -> Connections: 5
Node 0 -> Connections: 5

Now, we will examine each edge in the order specified and count the number of triangles. 

Triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 7, 4>
<3, 0, 7>
<3, 7, 4>
<7, 4, 6>
<8, 0, 9>
<8, 5, 0>
<8, 5, 2>
<9, 0, 1>

Total number of triangles: [12]
