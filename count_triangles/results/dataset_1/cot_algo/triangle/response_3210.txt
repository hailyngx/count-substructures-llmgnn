Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

- Node 6 is not connected to any other node, so it has degree 0.
- Nodes 2 and 9 have degree 2.
- Nodes 4 and 7 have degree 3.
- Nodes 1 and 8 have degree 4.
- Nodes 0 and 5 have degree 5.
- Node 3 has degree 6.

We relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 6 (degree 0) becomes node 0.
- Nodes 2 and 9 (degree 2) become nodes 1 and 2.
- Nodes 4 and 7 (degree 3) become nodes 3 and 4.
- Nodes 1 and 8 (degree 4) become nodes 5 and 6.
- Nodes 0 and 5 (degree 5) become nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 3 (degree 6) becomes node 9.

Now we list the edges with their new labels:

- (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7)

We will now count the number of triangles by examining shared connections. The triangles are found as follows:
- Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle <0, 8, 1>
- Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle <3, 4, 5>
- Triangle <5, 7, 9>

Counting all the unique triangles, we find a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
