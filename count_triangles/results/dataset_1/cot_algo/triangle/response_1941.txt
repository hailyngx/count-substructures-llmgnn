Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0 has 1 connection.
Node 2 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 1 connection.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and examining each edge with the lower labeled node, we find the following triangles:
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 4>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

Unique triangles found:
<1, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
