Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph after sorting the vertices based on their degree is:
Vertices: 8, 1, 6, 0, 3, 4, 5, 2, 9, 7

Based on the given edges, the triangles formed are:
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 1>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
