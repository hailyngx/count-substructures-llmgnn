Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degree, we have the following new labels for the nodes:
Node 3 (Degree 2) -> Label 0
Node 7 (Degree 2) -> Label 1
Node 6 (Degree 3) -> Label 2
Node 9 (Degree 3) -> Label 3
Node 5 (Degree 4) -> Label 4
Node 4 (Degree 5) -> Label 5
Node 1 (Degree 6) -> Label 6
Node 2 (Degree 6) -> Label 7
Node 0 (Degree 8) -> Label 8
Node 8 (Degree 8) -> Label 9

Now, let's list the triangles based on the shared connections:
1. <5, 8, 9>
2. <2, 7, 9>
3. <0, 4, 5>
4. <0, 4, 8>
5. <0, 5, 8>
6. <1, 5, 9>
7. <0, 6, 8>
8. <1, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
