Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes sorted by degree: 2, 8, 7, 5, 4, 1, 8, 0, 9, 6

Edges to be considered based on the method:
(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 9), (6, 9)
