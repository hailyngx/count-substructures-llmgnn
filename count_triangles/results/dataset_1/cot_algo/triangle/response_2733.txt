Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:

Vertex 0 has degree 2
Vertex 1 has degree 1
Vertex 5 has degree 1
Vertex 6 has degree 1
Vertex 9 has degree 3
Vertex 3 has degree 4
Vertex 4 has degree 4
Vertex 8 has degree 3
Vertex 7 has degree 4
Vertex 2 has degree 3

After sorting, the new labels for the vertices become:

Vertex 1 (Degree 1)
Vertex 5 (Degree 1)
Vertex 6 (Degree 1)
Vertex 0 (Degree 2)
Vertex 9 (Degree 3)
Vertex 2 (Degree 3)
Vertex 8 (Degree 3)
Vertex 3 (Degree 4)
Vertex 4 (Degree 4)
Vertex 7 (Degree 4)

Now, we will iterate through the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 1, 3, 7 <1, 3, 7>
- Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 1, 3, 9 <1, 3, 9>
- Edge (5, 6) does not form any triangle
- Edge (0, 2) does not form any triangle
- Edge (0, 8) does not form any triangle
- Edge (0, 8) does not form any triangle
- Edge (2, 4) does not form any triangle
- Edge (2, 4) does not form any triangle
- Edge (3, 7) does not form any triangle
- Edge (3, 7) does not form any triangle
- Edge (3, 9) does not form any triangle
- Edge (4, 7) does not form any triangle
- Edge (4, 7) does not form any triangle
- Edge (4, 8) does not form any triangle
- Edge (5, 6) does not form any triangle
- Edge (5, 6) does not form any triangle
- Edge (7, 9) does not form any triangle
- Edge (7, 9) does not form any triangle

The total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 7> and <1, 3, 9>.
