Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labels are:
- Vertex 3 (Degree 1)
- Vertex 7 (Degree 1)
- Vertex 8 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 5 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 2 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 4 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 6 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 1 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 9 (Degree 8)
- Vertex 0 (Degree 8)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections between vertices:
- Triangle <9, 0, 4>
- Triangle <9, 0, 6>
- Triangle <9, 0, 2>
- Triangle <9, 0, 5>
- Triangle <9, 2, 0>
- 5 triangles in total

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
