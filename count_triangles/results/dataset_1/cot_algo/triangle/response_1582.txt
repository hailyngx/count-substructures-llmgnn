Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following order: 

Vertices: 
1. 6 (Degree: 1)
2. 7 (Degree: 1)
3. 8 (Degree: 2)
4. 3 (Degree: 2)
5. 5 (Degree: 3)
6. 9 (Degree: 4)
7. 1 (Degree: 5)
8. 2 (Degree: 5)
9. 0 (Degree: 6)
10. 4 (Degree: 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges based on the vertices with lower degree labels. 

Analyzing the edges that form triangles:

For edge (0, 1): Shared connection with vertex 2 forms a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
For edge (0, 2): Shared connection with vertex 1 forms a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
For edge (0, 4): Shared connection with vertices 1 and 2 forms two triangles <0, 1, 4> and <0, 2, 4>.
For edge (0, 5): Shared connection with vertices 4 and 8 forms two triangles <0, 4, 5> and <0, 5, 8>.
For edge (0, 9): Shared connection with vertices 2 and 4 forms a triangle <0, 2, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
