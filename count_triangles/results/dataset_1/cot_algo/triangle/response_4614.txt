Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly:
Node 0: 3 edges
Node 1: 3 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 2: 4 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 8: 2 edges
Node 9: 2 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 6: 6 edges

Now, we count the triangles based on the shared connections between vertices:

Triangles: <0, 4, 7> <0, 5, 3> <1, 2, 6> <1, 5, 3> <2, 6, 1> <3, 5, 6> <6, 8, 2> <6, 8, 2> <6, 9, 0> 

Total number of triangles: [9]
