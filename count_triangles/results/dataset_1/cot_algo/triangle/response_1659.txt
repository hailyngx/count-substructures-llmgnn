Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degree:
Vertex 2 has degree 2
Vertex 6 has degree 2
Vertex 8 has degree 2
Vertex 3 has degree 3
Vertex 5 has degree 3
Vertex 1 has degree 4
Vertex 7 has degree 4
Vertex 0 has degree 5
Vertex 9 has degree 5
Vertex 4 has degree 6

Based on the degree-based ordering, the new vertex labels are: 
2 -> 0, 6 -> 1, 8 -> 2
3 -> 3, 5 -> 4
1 -> 5, 7 -> 6
0 -> 7, 9 -> 8
4 -> 9

The edges in the new order are:
(2, 4), (6, 5), (8, 1)
(3, 9), (4, 5), (5, 1), (1, 6)
(7, 4), (7, 9)
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 9)
(9, 4), (9, 6), (4, 6), (4, 0)

Calculating the triangles:
Triangles: [<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [6]
