Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the order is as follows: 0, 7, 3, 5, 2, 9, 4, 6, 1, 8.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

By examining the shared connections between vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles:
<1, 2, 4> 
<1, 4, 6> 
<1, 4, 9> 
<1, 6, 9> 
<2, 1, 4> 
<2, 1, 6> 
<2, 6, 8> 
<4, 1, 6> 
<5, 6, 9> 

Total number of triangles: [ 9 ]
