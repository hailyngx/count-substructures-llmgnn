Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the relabeling of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 0 has 2 connections.
Vertex 1 has 3 connections.
Vertex 4 has 3 connections.
Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
Vertex 7 has 3 connections.
Vertex 2 has 4 connections.
Vertex 8 has 5 connections.
Vertex 3 has 6 connections.
Vertex 5 has 6 connections.
Vertex 9 has 8 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges as described in the prompt. The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 9, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 2, 6>
<5, 4, 9>
<5, 8, 1>
