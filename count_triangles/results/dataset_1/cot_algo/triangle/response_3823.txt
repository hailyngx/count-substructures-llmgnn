Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

- Node 2 has 1 connection.
- Node 3 has 1 connection.
- Node 8 has 0 connections.

Therefore, the nodes are relabeled as follows: 
Node 8 (0 connections) -> Node 0
Node 2 (1 connection) -> Node 1
Node 3 (1 connection) -> Node 2
Node 0 (3 connections) -> Node 3
Node 1 (4 connections) -> Node 4
Node 4 (3 connections) -> Node 5
Node 7 (3 connections) -> Node 6
Node 6 (4 connections) -> Node 7
Node 5 (4 connections) -> Node 8
Node 9 (5 connections) -> Node 9

Using the relabeled nodes, we can now count the number of triangles by following the edges:

- Node 2 (Node 1): No triangles.
- Node 3 (Node 2): No triangles.
- Node 0 (Node 3): No triangles.
- Node 1 (Node 4): No triangles.
- Node 4 (Node 5): No triangles.
- Node 4 (Node 1): Triangle with Node 0.
- Node 4 (Node 6): No triangles.
- Node 4 (Node 7): Triangle with Node 0.
- Node 0 (Node 1): No triangles.
- Node 0 (Node 5): Triangle with Node 7.
- Node 0 (Node 6): No triangles.
- Node 5 (Node 1): No triangles.
- Node 5 (Node 7): No triangles.
- Node 5 (Node 8): Triangle with Node 0 and Node 7.
- Node 7 (Node 6): No triangles.
- Node 7 (Node 4): No triangles.
- Node 7 (Node 0): No triangles.
- Node 1 (Node 0): No triangles.
- Node 1 (Node 9): No triangles.
- Node 1 (Node 8): No triangles.
- Node 6 (Node 7): No triangles.
- Node 6 (Node 4): No triangles.
- Node 6 (Node 9): Triangle with Node 7 and Node 0.
- Node 9 (Node 1): No triangles.
- Node 9 (Node 5): No triangles.
- Node 9 (Node 7): Triangle with Node 0 and Node 5.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <7, 9, 0>.
