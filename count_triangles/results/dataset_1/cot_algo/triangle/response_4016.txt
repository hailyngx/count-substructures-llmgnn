Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections: 

0: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
7: 1 connection
2: 2 connections
6: 3 connections
4: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 2 connections
3: 4 connections
5: 0 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices according to their degrees:

0: 0 connections
7: 1 connection
2: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
5: 4 connections

Now, we will go through the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (1, 2): Check for shared connections between vertices 1 and 2 (no triangles).
2. Edge (1, 6): Check for shared connections between vertices 1 and 6 (no triangles).
3. Edge (1, 8): Check for shared connections between vertices 1 and 8 (no triangles).
4. Edge (2, 6): Check for shared connections between vertices 2 and 6 (no triangles).
5. Edge (3, 4): Check for shared connections between vertices 3 and 4 (no triangles).
6. Edge (3, 6): Check for shared connections between vertices 3 and 6 (Triangle: <3, 4, 6>).
7. Edge (3, 8): Check for shared connections between vertices 3 and 8 (no triangles).
8. Edge (3, 9): Check for shared connections between vertices 3 and 9 (no triangles).
9. Edge (4, 7): Check for shared connections between vertices 4 and 7 (no triangles).
10. Edge (4, 0): Check for shared connections between vertices 4 and 0 (Triangle: <0, 3, 4>).
11. Edge (4, 3): Check for shared connections between vertices 4 and 3 (no triangles).
12. Edge (4, 7): Check for shared connections between vertices 4 and 7 (no triangles).
13. Edge (6, 1): Check for shared connections between vertices 6 and 1 (no triangles).
14. Edge (6, 2): Check for shared connections between vertices 6 and 2 (no triangles).
15. Edge (6, 3): Check for shared connections between vertices 6 and 3 (no triangles).
16. Edge (8, 1): Check for shared connections between vertices 8 and 1 (no triangles).
17. Edge (8, 3): Check for shared connections between vertices 8 and 3 (Triangle: <3, 6, 8>).
18. Edge (8, 9): Check for shared connections between vertices 8 and 9 (no triangles).
19. Edge (9, 3): Check for shared connections between vertices 9 and 3 (no triangles).
20. Edge (9, 8): Check for shared connections between vertices 9 and 8 (no triangles).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
