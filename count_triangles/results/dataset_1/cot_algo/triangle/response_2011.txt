Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices from least to most connections:

Vertex 6: 0 connections -> Relabeled as Node 0
Vertex 9: 2 connections -> Relabeled as Node 1
Vertex 4: 2 connections -> Relabeled as Node 2
Vertex 5: 2 connections -> Relabeled as Node 3
Vertex 8: 2 connections -> Relabeled as Node 4
Vertex 7: 3 connections -> Relabeled as Node 5
Vertex 0: 3 connections -> Relabeled as Node 6
Vertex 1: 3 connections -> Relabeled as Node 7
Vertex 3: 4 connections -> Relabeled as Node 8
Vertex 2: 4 connections -> Relabeled as Node 9

Now, we will check for triangles based on the relabeled vertices:

1. (0, 2): Shared connections with 3 -> Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. (0, 7): Shared connections with 3 -> Triangle <0, 7, 3>
3. (1, 3): Shared connections with 7 -> Triangle <1, 3, 7>
4. (1, 7): Shared connections with 3 -> Triangle <1, 7, 3>
5. (1, 9): No triangle formed
6. (2, 4): No triangle formed
7. (2, 6): No triangle formed
8. (2, 8): No triangle formed
9. (3, 8): No triangle formed
10. (4, 5): No triangle formed
11. (7, 9): No triangle formed

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 7, 3>, <1, 3, 7>
