Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections, we have the following labels for each node:
Node 6: 0 connections
Nodes 0, 7, 8, 9: 1 connection
Nodes 3, 5: 2 connections
Nodes 1, 2, 4: 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting triangles using the edges provided.

The triangles found are:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 2, 0>

Total number of triangles: [4]
