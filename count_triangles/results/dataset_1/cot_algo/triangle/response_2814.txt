Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices with the number of connections:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections

Now, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Vertex 4 (1 connection)
- Vertex 1 (2 connections)
- Vertex 2 (2 connections)
- Vertex 5 (2 connections)
- Vertex 0 (3 connections)
- Vertex 3 (3 connections)
- Vertex 7 (3 connections)
- Vertex 8 (3 connections)
- Vertex 9 (4 connections)
- Vertex 6 (5 connections)

Next, we iterate through the edges according to the degree-based ordering to count the triangles.
Triangles:
- <0, 7, 3>
- <0, 7, 5>
- <0, 8, 3>
- <0, 8, 6>
- <0, 9, 3>
- <0, 9, 5>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <2, 6, 4>
- <3, 7, 5>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
