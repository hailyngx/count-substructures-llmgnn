Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Node 3 : Degree 2  
Node 9 : Degree 2  
Node 1 : Degree 3  
Node 4 : Degree 3  
Node 7 : Degree 3  
Node 5 : Degree 4  
Node 6 : Degree 4  
Node 8 : Degree 4  
Node 2 : Degree 5  
Node 0 : Degree 6 

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
