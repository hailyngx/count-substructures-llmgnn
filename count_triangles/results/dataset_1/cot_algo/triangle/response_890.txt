Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a table to represent the connections for each node:

| Node | Connections |
|------|-------------|
| 0    | 1           |
| 1    | 0, 2, 5, 9  |
| 2    | 1, 3, 6     |
| 3    | 2, 8, 9     |
| 4    | 8, 9        |
| 5    | 1           |
| 6    | 2, 9        |
| 8    | 3, 4        |
| 9    | 1, 3, 4, 6  |

Now, let's sort the nodes based on the number of connections in increasing order and label them accordingly:

| Node | Connections | Label |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 0    | 1           | 1     |
| 5    | 1           | 2     |
| 8    | 2           | 3     |
| 4    | 2           | 4     |
| 6    | 2           | 5     |
| 2    | 3           | 6     |
| 3    | 3           | 7     |
| 9    | 4           | 8     |
| 1    | 4           | 9     |

Now, we will go through each edge and check for shared connections to count the triangles:
1. (0, 1): No shared connections.
2. (1, 0): No shared connections.
3. (1, 2): Triangle formed: <1, 2, 3>.
4. (1, 5): No shared connections.
5. (1, 9): Triangle formed: <1, 9, 3>.
6. (2, 1): No shared connections.
7. (2, 3): Triangle formed: <2, 3, 9>.
8. (2, 6): No shared connections.
9. (3, 2): No shared connections.
10. (3, 8): No shared connections.
11. (3, 9): No shared connections.
12. (4, 8): No shared connections.
13. (4, 9): Triangle formed: <4, 9, 3>.
14. (5, 1): No shared connections.
15. (6, 2): No shared connections.
16. (6, 9): No shared connections.
17. (8, 3): No shared connections.
18. (8, 4): No shared connections.
19. (9, 1): No shared connections.
20. (9, 3): No shared connections.
21. (9, 4): No shared connections.
22. (9, 6): No shared connections.

So, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 3>, <1, 9, 3>, and <4, 9, 3>.
