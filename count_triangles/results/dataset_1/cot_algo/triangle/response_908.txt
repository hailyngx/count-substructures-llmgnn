Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 3 -> Label 0
Vertex 2 -> Label 1
Vertex 9 -> Label 2
Vertex 5 -> Label 3
Vertex 1 -> Label 4
Vertex 4 -> Label 5
Vertex 7 -> Label 6
Vertex 0 -> Label 7
Vertex 6 -> Label 8
Vertex 8 -> Label 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and following the guidelines provided, we can count the number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
