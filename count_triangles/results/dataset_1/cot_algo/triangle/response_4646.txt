Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by the number of connections:
Node 5: degree 0
Node 9: degree 1
Nodes 2, 4: degree 1
Nodes 0, 5: degree 2
Nodes 1, 7: degree 3
Nodes 3, 8: degree 5
Node 6: degree 6

Relabeling the nodes accordingly:
Node 5 -> 0
Node 9 -> 1
Node 2 -> 2
Node 4 -> 3
Node 0 -> 4
Node 1 -> 5
Node 7 -> 6
Node 3 -> 7
Node 8 -> 8
Node 6 -> 9

Now, we analyze the edges based on the new labeling:
Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.
Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
Edge (3, 8) forms triangle with shared connection at node 7: <3, 7, 8>.
Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle.
Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle.
Edge (5, 4) does not form a triangle.
Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle.
Edge (0, 6) does not form a triangle.
Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
Edge (6, 8) forms triangle with shared connection at node 7: <6, 7, 8>.
Edge (6, 3) forms triangle with shared connection at node 7: <6, 3, 7>.
Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle.
Edge (1, 6) forms triangle with shared connection at node 5: <1, 6, 5>.
Edge (1, 8) forms triangle with shared connection at node 6: <1, 8, 6>.
Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
Edge (7, 8) forms triangle with shared connection at node 3: <7, 8, 3>.
Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle.
Edge (7, 2) does not form a triangle.
Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
