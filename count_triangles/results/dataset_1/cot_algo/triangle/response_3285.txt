Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices in ascending order of their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0 -> degree 3
Node 3 -> degree 0
Node 6 -> degree 0
Node 4 -> degree 2
Node 1 -> degree 4
Node 2 -> degree 3
Node 5 -> degree 3
Node 8 -> degree 2
Node 7 -> degree 4
Node 9 -> degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Checking for triangles:
- For edge (0, 1): Node 0 and Node 1 share Node 9, forming a triangle <0, 1, 9>.
- For edge (0, 2): No triangles formed.
- For edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 share Node 9, forming a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
- For edge (1, 5): Node 1 and Node 5 do not form triangles.
- For edge (1, 6): No triangles formed.
- For edge (1, 9): Node 1 and Node 9 share Node 6, forming a triangle <1, 9, 6>.
- For edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.
- For edge (2, 7): Node 2 and Node 7 share Node 5, forming a triangle <2, 7, 5>.
- For edge (4, 9): Node 4 and Node 9 share Node 0, forming a triangle <4, 9, 0>.
- For edge (5, 7): Node 5 and Node 7 share Node 9, forming a triangle <5, 7, 9>.
- For edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.

The total number of triangles is [5]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 9, 6>, <2, 7, 5>, and <4, 9, 0>.
