Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most:

Vertex 1 (0): 4 connections
Vertex 2 (2): 4 connections
Vertex 3 (3): 6 connections
Vertex 4 (4): 1 connection
Vertex 5 (5): 3 connections
Vertex 6 (6): 2 connections
Vertex 7 (7): 6 connections
Vertex 8 (8): 2 connections
Vertex 9 (9): 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly and check for triangles based on the edges given:

New label: Original label
1: 4
2: 6
3: 8
4: 5
5: 1
6: 9
7: 2
8: 3
9: 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 2, 7>
<3, 2, 8>
<3, 7, 6>
<5, 0, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
