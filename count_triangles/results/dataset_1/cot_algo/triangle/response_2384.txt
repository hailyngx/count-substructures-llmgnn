Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most and then relabeling them accordingly.

After relabeling the vertices, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 3 -> A (degree 1)
Node 4 -> B (degree 2)
Node 6 -> C (degree 2)
Node 8 -> D (degree 2)
Node 7 -> E (degree 1)
Node 2 -> F (degree 1)
Node 9 -> G (degree 4)
Node 5 -> H (degree 3)
Node 1 -> I (degree 5)

Now we check each edge, but only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangular relationships found:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
