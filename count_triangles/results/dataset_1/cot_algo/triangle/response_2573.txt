Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, from least to most. Then each vertex will be relabeled accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices based on their number of connections is:  
Vertex 0: 3 connections  
Vertex 2: 3 connections  
Vertex 4: 3 connections  
Vertex 6: 2 connections  
Vertex 8: 2 connections  
Vertex 1: 2 connections  
Vertex 7: 3 connections  
Vertex 5: 7 connections  
Vertex 3: 5 connections  

We will now count the triangles based on this order:

1. (0, 1) -> Shared connection with 3: <0, 1, 3>
2. (0, 3) -> Shared connection with 1 and 5: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 5>
3. (0, 5) -> Shared connection with 1 and 3: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 5>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 5>
