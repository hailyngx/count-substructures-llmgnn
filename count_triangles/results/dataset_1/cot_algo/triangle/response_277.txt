Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabelled as follows:
- Node 7 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 0 and 1 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 5 and 6 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 4 and 9 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 3 and 8 have 4 connections each.
- Node 2 has 5 connections.

Using this relabelling, we can now count the number of triangles by considering the edges in the given graph.

The total number of triangles inside brackets is: [26]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 9, 7>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 9, 7>, <5, 3, 9>, <6, 0, 2>, <6, 2, 8>, <8, 1, 4>, <8, 2, 4>, <8, 2, 6>, <8, 4, 9>, <9, 2, 4>, <9, 2, 7>, <9, 3, 5>, <9, 3, 7>, <9, 4, 7>
