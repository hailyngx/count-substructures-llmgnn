Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are: 3, 4, 6, 1, 9, 8, 0, 7, 5, 2.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles:

1. (3, 2, 4) - <3, 2, 4>
2. (6, 5, 7) - <6, 5, 7>
3. (0, 7, 9) - <0, 7, 9>
4. (1, 5, 8) - <1, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
