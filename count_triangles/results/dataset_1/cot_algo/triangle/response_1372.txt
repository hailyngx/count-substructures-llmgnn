Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree:
0 (3 connections)
1 (1 connection)
2 (2 connections)
3 (4 connections)
4 (4 connections)
5 (3 connections)
6 (4 connections)
7 (6 connections)
8 (2 connections)
9 (5 connections)

Triangles:
[<0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [11]
