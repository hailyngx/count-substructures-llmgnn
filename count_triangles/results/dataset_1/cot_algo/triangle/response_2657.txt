Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Sorting vertices by their number of connections:  
Node 7 has 2 connections.  
Node 8 has 1 connection.  
Nodes 2, 3, 6 have 3 connections each.  
Nodes 1 and 5 have 4 connections each.  
Node 0 has 6 connections.  
Node 4 has 7 connections.  
Node 9 has 5 connections.  

Checking for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:  
Comparing edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:  
- (8, 2)  
- (5, 7)  
- (3, 9)  
- (3, 6)  
- (3, 0)  
- (1, 2)  
- (0, 6)  
- (0, 7)  
- (0, 9)  
- (6, 7)  
- (6, 5)  
- (6, 4)  
- (1, 9)  
- (1, 4)  
- (2, 5)  
- (2, 4)  
- (0, 4)  
- (9, 5)  
- (9, 4)  

Total number of triangles: [18]  
Unique triangles: <0, 6, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 0, 6>, <3, 0, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <9, 4, 5>, <9, 4, 6>, <9, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 9, 4>
