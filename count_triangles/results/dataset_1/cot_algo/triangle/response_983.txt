Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 - degree 3
Node 1 - degree 2
Node 2 - degree 5
Node 3 - degree 1
Node 4 - degree 2
Node 5 - degree 3
Node 6 - degree 2
Node 7 - degree 3
Node 8 - degree 1
Node 9 - degree 2

Now, we consider the edges in the graph, following the condition that we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex.

Calculating the number of triangles formed:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 3>
- Triangle 3: <2, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
