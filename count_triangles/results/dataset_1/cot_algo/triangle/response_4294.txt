Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following order: 

Vertex 6: Degree 2
Vertex 1: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 9: Degree 3
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 5
Vertex 4: Degree 6
Vertex 7: Degree 6
Vertex 0: Degree 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

Triangles: [9]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
