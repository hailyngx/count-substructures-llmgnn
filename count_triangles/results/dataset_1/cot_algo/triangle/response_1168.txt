Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 0 has 2 connections
- Node 1 has 3 connections
- Node 8 has 3 connections
- Node 4 has 3 connections
- Node 7 has 4 connections
- Node 9 has 4 connections
- Node 3 has 4 connections
- Node 2 has 4 connections
- Node 5 has 4 connections
- Node 6 has 3 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. Start with the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
    - Edge (0, 1): Node 0 has 2 connections, and Node 1 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
    - Edge (0, 8): Node 0 has 2 connections, and Node 8 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
    - Edge (1, 4): Node 1 has 3 connections, and Node 4 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
    - Edge (1, 7): Node 1 has 3 connections, and Node 7 has 4 connections. Checking shared connections for Node 1, 7 reveals a triangle with Node 7, 4.
    - Edge (2, 5): Node 2 has 4 connections, and Node 5 has 4 connections. No triangle is formed.
    - Edge (2, 6): Node 2 has 4 connections, and Node 6 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
    - Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has 4 connections, and Node 4 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
    - Edge (3, 8): Node 3 has 4 connections, and Node 8 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
    - Edge (3, 9): Node 3 has 4 connections, and Node 9 has 4 connections. No triangle is formed.
    - Edge (5, 4): Node 5 has 4 connections, and Node 4 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
    - Edge (5, 7): Node 5 has 4 connections, and Node 7 has 4 connections. Checking shared connections for Node 5, 7 reveals a triangle with Node 5, 9.
    - Edge (9, 6): Node 6 has 3 connections, and Node 9 has 4 connections. Checking shared connections for Node 9, 6 reveals a triangle with Node 9, 5.

Count of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <7, 1, 4>, <5, 7, 9>, <9, 5, 6>
