Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes in ascending order of degree: 7, 9, 3, 8, 0, 5, 4, 1, 6, 2

Now, we will enumerate the nodes based on their degree: 
Node 7 - Degree 2
Node 9 - Degree 2
Node 3 - Degree 2
Node 8 - Degree 2
Node 0 - Degree 3
Node 5 - Degree 4
Node 4 - Degree 4
Node 1 - Degree 4
Node 6 - Degree 6
Node 2 - Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 5, 9>

[6] triangles in total.
