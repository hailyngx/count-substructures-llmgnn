Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 2 [degree 1]
Node 9 [degree 1]
Node 0 [degree 3]
Node 5 [degree 3]
Node 8 [degree 3]
Node 4 [degree 4]
Node 7 [degree 4]
Node 6 [degree 5]
Node 3 [degree 5]
Node 1 [degree 6]

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 7>
