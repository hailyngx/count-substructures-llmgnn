Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
