Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of their connections from least to most, the new ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 1 : 2 connections 
Vertex 2 : 3 connections 
Vertex 3 : 2 connections 
Vertex 4 : 5 connections 
Vertex 5 : 4 connections 
Vertex 6 : 5 connections 
Vertex 7 : 4 connections 
Vertex 8 : 4 connections 
Vertex 9 : 4 connections 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
