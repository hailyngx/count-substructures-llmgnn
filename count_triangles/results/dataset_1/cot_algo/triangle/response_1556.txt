Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by degree from lowest to highest are as follows:
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 3: 4 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:

1. Edge (1, 3): Shared connections: 8, total triangles = <1, 3, 8>
2. Edge (1, 5): Shared connections: none
3. Edge (1, 8): Shared connections: 7, total triangles = <1, 8, 7>
4. Edge (2, 5): Shared connections: none
5. Edge (2, 7): Shared connections: 5, total triangles = <2, 7, 5>
6. Edge (3, 8): Shared connections: 1, total triangles = <3, 8, 1>
7. Edge (3, 9): Shared connections: none
8. Edge (4, 5): Shared connections: none
9. Edge (4, 7): Shared connections: none
10. Edge (5, 7): Shared connections: 2, total triangles = <5, 7, 2>
11. Edge (7, 8): Shared connections: 9, total triangles = <7, 8, 9>
 
Total number of triangles in the graph: [5]
