Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections, we have the following order:
Node 4 (Degree 1)  
Node 7 (Degree 3)  
Node 6 (Degree 3)  
Node 0 (Degree 3)  
Node 3 (Degree 4)  
Node 1 (Degree 5)  
Node 5 (Degree 5)  
Node 9 (Degree 6)  
Node 8 (Degree 6)  
Node 2 (Degree 6)  

Now we will check for triangles based on the degree-based ordering:

- (0, 2) shares node 5: <0, 2, 5>
- (0, 7) doesn't form a triangle
- (0, 9) shares node 5: <0, 5, 9>
- (1, 3) doesn't form a triangle
- (1, 5) doesn't form a triangle
- (1, 6) doesn't form a triangle
- (1, 8) doesn't form a triangle
- (2, 3) doesn't form a triangle
- (2, 5) doesn't form a triangle
- (2, 7) doesn't form a triangle
- (2, 8) shares node 5: <2, 5, 8>
- (3, 9) shares node 5: <3, 5, 9>
- (4, 9) doesn't form a triangle
- (5, 8) doesn't form a triangle
- (5, 9) doesn't form a triangle
- (6, 7) doesn't form a triangle
- (6, 8) doesn't form a triangle
- (7, 0) doesn't form a triangle
- (7, 6) doesn't form a triangle
- (8, 9) doesn't form a triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 8>.
