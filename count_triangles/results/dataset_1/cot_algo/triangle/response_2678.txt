Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 has 1 connection
Node 9 has 2 connections
Node 5 has 2 connections
Node 8 has 3 connections
Node 6 has 3 connections
Node 4 has 3 connections
Node 2 has 4 connections
Node 7 has 5 connections
Node 3 has 5 connections
Node 1 has 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

Number of triangles: [2]
Triangles: <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 9>
