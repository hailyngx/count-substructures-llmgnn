Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 5 connections
- Vertex 2: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 1 connection
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 1 connection

Now, relabel the vertices from least to most connections:
- Vertex 0: 0 connections
- Vertex 6: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 1 connection
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 5 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 3) is skipped because vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 3.
- Edge (6, 2) is skipped because vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 6.
- Edge (9, 8) is skipped because vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 9.

The triangles are formed by the following connections: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 7), (1, 7, 8), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5), (2, 5, 7). 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 7>.
