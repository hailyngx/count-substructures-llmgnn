Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted as follows based on their number of connections:
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections

Using the degree-based ordering, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Based on the given edges, we can find the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <1, 7, 8>
6. <2, 3, 4>
7. <2, 3, 7>
8. <3, 4, 9>
9. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
