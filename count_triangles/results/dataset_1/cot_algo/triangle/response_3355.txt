Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method organizes the vertices based on the number of connections:

Node 3: 0 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 4: 5 connections

Based on the ordering, we will analyze the edges in the graph:

1. (0, 6): Shared connections with 2, forming triangle <0, 2, 6>.
2. (0, 7): No triangle formed.
3. (1, 4): Shared connection with 2, forming triangle <1, 2, 4>.
4. (1, 8): Shared connection with 4, forming triangle <1, 4, 8>.
5. (2, 4): No triangle formed.
6. (2, 6): No triangle formed.
7. (4, 1): Shared connection with 2, forming triangle <1, 2, 4>.
8. (4, 2): No triangle formed.
9. (4, 8): Shared connection with 1, forming triangle <1, 4, 8>.
10. (5, 8): No triangle formed.
11. (6, 0): Shared connections with 2, forming triangle <0, 2, 6>.
12. (6, 2): Shared connection with 0, forming triangle <0, 2, 6>.
13. (7, 0): No triangle formed.
14. (8, 1): Shared connection with 4, forming triangle <1, 4, 8>.
15. (8, 4): Shared connection with 1, forming triangle <1, 4, 8>.
16. (8, 5): No triangle formed.
17. (8, 9): No triangle formed.
18. (9, 8): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles found: <0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 8>.
