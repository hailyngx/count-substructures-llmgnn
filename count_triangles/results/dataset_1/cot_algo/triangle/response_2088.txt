Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels are as follows: 
Node 5 is connected to 0 nodes. 
Nodes 7 and 10 are connected to 1 node each. 
Nodes 3, 4, and 9 are connected to 2 nodes each. 
Nodes 1 and 6 are connected to 3 nodes each. 
Node 2 is connected to 4 nodes. 
Node 8 is connected to 5 nodes. 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges with the lower labeled vertex first. 

Checking each edge, we find the following triangles: 
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <1, 6, 8>
5. <2, 6, 7>
6. <2, 6, 9>
7. <2, 7, 9>
8. <8, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
