Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 5 connections.
Node 7 has 5 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This way, we avoid counting the same triangle multiple times.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
