Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are: 
0(4), 1(4), 4(4), 6(4), 2(3), 3(3), 5(2), 7(2), 9(1).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph.

Triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
