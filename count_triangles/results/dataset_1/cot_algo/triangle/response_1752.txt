Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 3: 0 connections  
Node 6: 0 connections  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 5: 2 connections  
Node 7: 2 connections  
Node 9: 2 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 2: 3 connections  

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will examine each edge and check for shared connections to find triangles:

Triangles:  
[11]  
<0, 1, 4>  
<0, 1, 8>  
<0, 5, 7>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
