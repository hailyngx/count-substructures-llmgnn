Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
By reordering the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following list: 
Nodes sorted by degree: [0, 7, 4, 8, 6, 5, 3, 9, 1, 2]

Now, we proceed to count the triangles:

Triangles: <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 9, 2>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 9, 3>

Total number of triangles: [9]
