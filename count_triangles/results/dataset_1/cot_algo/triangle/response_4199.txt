Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first list the vertices with their respective degrees:
Vertices: (0 - 3), (1 - 2), (2 - 1), (3 - 4), (4 - 2), (6 - 3), (7 - 5), (8 - 2), (9 - 1)

We will label the vertices as follows based on their degrees:
Label 0: 2, 8
Label 1: 1, 4, 9
Label 2: 0, 3, 7
Label 3: 5, 6
Label 4: 

Since Label 0 has 2 connections and Label 2 has 3 connections, we will only consider edges where the lower label is Label 0:

1. (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 6 <0, 3, 6>
2. (0, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 3 <0, 6, 3>

Total number of triangles: [2]  
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 3>
