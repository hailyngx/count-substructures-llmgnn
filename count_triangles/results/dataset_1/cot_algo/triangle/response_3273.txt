Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 0: 7 connections
Node 5: 7 connections

Based on the ordering above, we can count the triangles:

- For the edge (0, 5):
  Both nodes 0 and 5 have 7 connections.
  Shared connections: 2 and 7
  Triangle formed: <0, 2, 7>

- For the edge (0, 6):
  Node 0 has 7 connections, while node 6 has 2 connections.
  Shared connections: None
  No triangle formed.

- For the edge (0, 7):
  Node 0 has 7 connections, while node 7 has 6 connections.
  Shared connections: 2 and 7
  Triangle formed: <0, 2, 7>

- For the edge (0, 9):
  Both nodes 0 and 9 have 7 connections.
  Shared connections: None
  No triangle formed.

- For the edge (1, 3):
  Both nodes 1 and 3 have 3 connections.
  Shared connections: None
  No triangle formed.

- For the edge (1, 9):
  Both nodes 1 and 9 have 3 connections.
  Shared connections: None
  No triangle formed.

- For the edge (2, 4):
  Both nodes 2 and 4 have 4 connections.
  Shared connections: None
  No triangle formed.

- For the edge (2, 5):
  Node 2 has 4 connections, while node 5 has 7 connections.
  Shared connections: None
  No triangle formed.

- For the edge (2, 7):
  Node 2 has 4 connections, while node 7 has 6 connections.
  Shared connections: None
  No triangle formed.

- For the edge (3, 5):
  Node 3 has 3 connections, while node 5 has 7 connections.
  Shared connections: None
  No triangle formed.

- For the edge (3, 6):
  Node 3 has 3 connections, while node 6 has 2 connections.
  Shared connections: None
  No triangle formed.

- For the edge (4, 7):
  Node 4 has 4 connections, while node 7 has 6 connections.
  Shared connections: None
  No triangle formed.

- For the edge (5, 7):
  Node 5 has 7 connections, while node 7 has 6 connections.
  Shared connections: 2 and 7
  Triangle formed: <2, 5, 7>

- For the edge (7, 8):
  Node 7 has 6 connections, while node 8 has 2 connections.
  Shared connections: None
  No triangle formed.

- For the edge (8, 9):
  Node 8 has 2 connections, while node 9 has 3 connections.
  Shared connections: None
  No triangle formed.
