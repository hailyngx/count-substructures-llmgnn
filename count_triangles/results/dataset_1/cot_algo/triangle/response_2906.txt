Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective degrees are:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 3

Sorting the vertices based on their degrees in increasing order:
0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 8, 1, 2, 3

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
- Triangles involving vertex 0: None
- Triangles involving vertex 4: None
- Triangles involving vertex 5: None
- Triangles involving vertex 6: None
- Triangles involving vertex 7: None
- Triangles involving vertex 9: None
- Triangles involving vertex 8: None
- Triangles involving vertex 1: <1, 2, 3>
- Triangles involving vertex 2: <1, 2, 3>
- Triangles involving vertex 3: <1, 2, 3>

Total number of triangles: [3]
