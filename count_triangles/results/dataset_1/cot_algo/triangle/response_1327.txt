Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, we have the following labels: 
Node 1 (degree 1): 1
Node 0 (degree 2): 0
Node 4 (degree 2): 2
Node 8 (degree 2): 3
Node 6 (degree 3): 4
Node 9 (degree 3): 5
Node 3 (degree 4): 6
Node 5 (degree 4): 7
Node 7 (degree 6): 8
Node 2 (degree 7): 9

By counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find:
Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>
