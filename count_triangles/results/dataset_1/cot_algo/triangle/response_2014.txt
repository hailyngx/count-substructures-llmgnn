Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degree of connections:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections

Next, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0 -> Node 1
- Node 1 -> Node 2
- Node 7 -> Node 3
- Node 8 -> Node 4
- Node 5 -> Node 5
- Node 6 -> Node 6
- Node 4 -> Node 7
- Node 3 -> Node 8
- Node 2 -> Node 9

Now, let's examine the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Check edge (0, 3): Node 1 is connected to Node 8. No triangles.
- Check edge (0, 4): Node 1 is connected to Node 7. No triangles.
- Check edge (1, 5): Node 2 is connected to Node 5. No triangles.
- Check edge (1, 6): Node 2 is connected to Node 6. No triangles.
- Check edge (2, 4): Node 9 is connected to Node 4. No triangles.
- Check edge (2, 5): Node 9 is connected to Node 5. No triangles.
- Check edge (2, 7): Node 9 is connected to Node 7. No triangles.
- Check edge (2, 8): Node 9 is connected to Node 8. No triangles.
- Check edge (3, 0): Node 8 is connected to Node 1. No triangles.
- Check edge (3, 6): Node 8 is connected to Node 6. No triangles.
- Check edge (3, 8): Node 8 is connected to Node 4. No triangles.
- Check edge (4, 0): Node 7 is connected to Node 1. No triangles.
- Check edge (4, 2): Node 7 is connected to Node 9. No triangles.
- Check edge (4, 6): Node 7 is connected to Node 6. Triangle found: <4, 6, 7>.
- Check edge (5, 1): Node 5 is connected to Node 2. No triangles.
- Check edge (5, 2): Node 5 is connected to Node 9. No triangles.
- Check edge (5, 7): Node 5 is connected to Node 7. No triangles.
- Check edge (6, 1): Node 6 is connected to Node 2. No triangles.
- Check edge (6, 3): Node 6 is connected to Node 8. No triangles.
- Check edge (6, 4): Node 6 is connected to Node 7. Triangle found: <4, 6, 7>.
- Check edge (7, 2): Node 7 is connected to Node 9. No triangles.
- Check edge (7, 5): Node 7 is connected to Node 5. No triangles.
- Check edge (8, 2): Node 8 is connected to Node 9. No triangles.
- Check edge (8, 3): Node 8 is connected to Node 8. No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <4, 6, 7>
