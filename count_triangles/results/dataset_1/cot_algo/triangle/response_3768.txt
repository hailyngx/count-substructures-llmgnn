Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

Vertice degrees:
0: 3
1: 1
2: 1
3: 5
4: 6
5: 2
6: 5
7: 4
8: 3
9: 2

Vertices sorted by degree:
1 < 2 < 5 < 9 < 8 < 0 < 7 < 6 < 3 < 4

Now, count the triangles:

Triangles:
[13]
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
