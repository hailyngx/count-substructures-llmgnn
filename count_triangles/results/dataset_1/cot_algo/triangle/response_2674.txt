Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 4: 7 connections

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

- For edge (0, 4): Node 0 is connected to Node 4. Node 0, Node 4, and a shared connection form a triangle <0, 4, 2>.
- For edge (1, 2): Because Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 2, we proceed. No triangles are formed.
- For edge (1, 4): Node 1 is connected to Node 4. No triangles are formed since Node 1 has fewer connections.
- For edge (2, 1): No triangles are formed since Node 1 has fewer connections.
- For edge (2, 4): Node 2 is connected to Node 4. Node 1, Node 2, and a shared connection form a triangle <1, 2, 4>.
- For edge (2, 5): Because Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 5, we proceed. No triangles are formed.
- For edge (2, 8): Same as above. No triangles are formed.
- For edge (2, 9): Same as above. No triangles are formed.
- For edge (3, 4): Node 3 is connected to Node 4. Node 3, Node 4, and a shared connection form a triangle <3, 4, 2>.
- For edge (3, 6): Because Node 3 has more connections than Node 6, we don't proceed.
- For edge (3, 7): Node 3 is connected to Node 7. Node 3, Node 7, and a shared connection form a triangle <3, 7, 5>.
- For edge (3, 8): Node 3 is connected to Node 8. Node 3, Node 8, and a shared connection form a triangle <3, 8, 2>.
- For edge (4, 0): No triangles are formed since Node 0 has fewer connections.
- For edge (4, 1): No triangles are formed since Node 1 has fewer connections.
- For edge (4, 2): We already counted this triangle earlier.
- For edge (4, 3): We already counted this triangle earlier.
- For edge (5, 2): No triangles are formed since Node 2 has more connections.
- For edge (5, 7): No triangles are formed since Node 7 has more connections.
- For edge (6, 3): No triangles are formed since Node 3 has more connections.
- For edge (7, 3): We already counted this triangle earlier.
- For edge (7, 5): No triangles are formed since Node 5 has fewer connections.
- For edge (8, 2): We already counted this triangle earlier.
- For edge (8, 3): We already counted this triangle earlier.
- For edge (9, 2): No triangles are formed since Node 2 has more connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 2>, <1, 2, 4>, <3, 7, 5>.
