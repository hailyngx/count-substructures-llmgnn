Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes based on their degree:
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 8 has degree 6
Node 2 has degree 7
Node 3 has degree 7

Using the degree-based ordering method to count triangles:

Examining edge (0, 2): Node 0 has degree 3 which is less than the degree of Node 2 (7). Nodes 0 and 2 share a connection with Node 3 forming a triangle. Triangle: <0, 2, 3>.

Examining edge (0, 3): Node 0 has degree 3 which is less than the degree of Node 3 (7). Nodes 0 and 3 do not share a connection.

Examining edge (0, 4): Node 0 has degree 3 which is less than the degree of Node 4 (3). Nodes 0 and 4 do not share a connection.

Examining edge (1, 2): Node 1 has degree 3 which is less than the degree of Node 2 (7). Nodes 1 and 2 share a connection with Node 3 forming a triangle. Triangle: <1, 2, 3>.

Examining edge (1, 3): Node 1 has degree 3 which is less than the degree of Node 3 (7). Nodes 1 and 3 share a connection with Node 0 forming a triangle. Triangle: <1, 3, 0>.

Examining edge (1, 8): Node 1 has degree 3 which is less than the degree of Node 8 (6). Nodes 1 and 8 do not share a connection.

Examining edge (2, 0): Node 0 has degree 3 which is less than the degree of Node 2 (7). Nodes 2 and 0 share a connection with Node 3 forming a triangle. Triangle: <2, 0, 3>.

Examining edge (2, 1): Node 1 has degree 3 which is less than the degree of Node 2 (7). Nodes 2 and 1 share a connection with Node 3 forming a triangle. Triangle: <2, 1, 3>.

Examining edge (2, 3): Node 2 has degree 7 which is more than the degree of Node 3 (7).

Examining the remaining edges does not yield any new triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [3].
