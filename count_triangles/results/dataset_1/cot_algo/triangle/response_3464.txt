Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order. So, the sorted list of vertices will be: 3, 8, 9, 1, 6, 5, 0, 4, 7, 2.

Now, we will iterate through each edge and count the number of triangles based on the conditions mentioned earlier:

1. Edge (0, 1):
 - Vertices 0 and 1 have 5 shared connections: 2, 4, 7, 9.
 - So, the triangles formed are: <0, 2, 1>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 9, 1>.

2. Edge (0, 2):
 - Vertices 0 and 2 have 4 shared connections: 1, 4, 7, 9.
 - So, the triangles formed are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 9, 2>.

3. Edge (0, 4):
 - Vertices 0 and 4 have 4 shared connections: 1, 2, 7, 9.
 - So, the triangles formed are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 9, 4>.

4. Edge (0, 7):
 - Vertices 0 and 7 have 4 shared connections: 1, 2, 4, 9.
 - So, the triangles formed are: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 9, 7>.

5. Edge (0, 9):
 - Vertices 0 and 9 have 3 shared connections: 1, 4, 7.
 - So, the triangles formed are: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 9>.

6. Edge (1, 2) is not considered as vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 2.

7. Edge (1, 4):
 - Vertices 1 and 4 have 4 shared connections: 0, 2, 7, 9.
 - So, the triangles formed are: <1, 0, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 9, 4>.

8. Edge (1, 7):
 - Vertices 1 and 7 have 3 shared connections: 0, 2, 4.
 - So, the triangles formed are: <1, 0, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 7>.

9. Edge (1, 9):
 - Vertices 1 and 9 have 3 shared connections: 0, 4, 7.
 - So, the triangles formed are: <1, 0, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 9>.

Calculating the total number of triangles found: [24]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 9>.
