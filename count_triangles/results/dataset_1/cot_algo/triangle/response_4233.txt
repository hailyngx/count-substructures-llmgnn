Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following labels:

Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the triangles:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
