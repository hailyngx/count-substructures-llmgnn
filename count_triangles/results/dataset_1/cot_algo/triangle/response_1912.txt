Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 2: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections

Now, we go through the edges:

(0, 7): Shared connection with 4 <0, 4, 7>
(0, 4): No action
(1, 8): No action
(1, 9): No action
(2, 6): No action
(3, 8): No action
(3, 9): No action
(4, 5): No action
(4, 8): Shared connection with 0 and 7 <0, 4, 8> <4, 7, 8>
(5, 7): Shared connection with 4 <4, 5, 7>
(8, 1): No action
(9, 1): No action

The total number of triangles is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 7>.
