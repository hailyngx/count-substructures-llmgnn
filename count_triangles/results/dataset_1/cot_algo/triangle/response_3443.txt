Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices and their connections are as follows:
- Vertex 0: 1
- Vertex 1: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Vertex 2: 1, 7
- Vertex 3: 4, 5
- Vertex 4: 1, 3, 6
- Vertex 5: 3, 7
- Vertex 6: 4
- Vertex 7: 1, 2, 5
- Vertex 8: 9
- Vertex 9: 8

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and counting triangles, we find:
1. (1, 4) and (1, 7) share connection 1, forming triangle <1, 4, 7>.
2. (1, 2) and (1, 7) share connection 1, forming triangle <1, 2, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
