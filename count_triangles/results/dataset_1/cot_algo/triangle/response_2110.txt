Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the vertices with their degrees:
- Vertices 0, 1, 5 have degree 3
- Vertices 3, 7, 8, 9 have degree 2
- Vertex 2 has degree 4
- Vertex 4 has degree 6

Since there are no vertices with degree 1, we start by sorting the vertices in increasing order of their degrees: 3, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 5, 2, 4.

Now, let's list the edges while making sure to consider the vertices with lower labels having fewer connections:
1. (3, 0)
2. (7, 4)
3. (8, 2)
4. (9, 2)

Now, we check for shared connections between the vertices of each edge to count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <3, 0, 4>
- Triangle 2: <8, 2, 4>
- Triangle 3: <9, 2, 4>

Total number of triangles: [3]
