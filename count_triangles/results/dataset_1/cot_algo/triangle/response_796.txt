Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the number of triangles in the graph.

1. Sort nodes by their degrees in ascending order:
Original node order: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Sorted node order: 2, 9, 1, 6, 4, 7, 5, 8, 0, 3

2. Count the number of triangles formed:
- Triangles involving node 2: None
- Triangles involving node 9: None
- Triangles involving node 1: <0, 1, 6>
- Triangles involving node 6: <1, 4, 6>
- Triangles involving node 4: <3, 4, 5>
- Triangles involving node 7: <3, 5, 7>
- Triangles involving node 5: <3, 5, 8>
- Triangles involving node 8: <0, 3, 8>, <4, 5, 8>
- Triangles involving node 0: None
- Triangles involving node 3: None

Total number of triangles: [7]
