Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new label for each vertex will be:
Vertices: 3, 4, 0, 6, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 2

Now, we will iterate through each edge in the graph, checking for shared connections to count the number of triangles. 

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 0, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
