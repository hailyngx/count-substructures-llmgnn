Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following list: 
Vertices: [3, 9, 6, 2, 8, 5, 4, 1, 0, 7]

Now, analyzing the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
<3, 7> has 1 shared connection with nodes 0 and 5 forming the triangle <0, 5, 7>.
<9, 1> has 1 shared connection with node 4 forming the triangle <4, 1, 9>.
<6, 7> has 1 shared connection with node 5 forming the triangle <5, 6, 7>.
<2, 6> has no shared connections.
<8, 5> has no shared connections.

Total number of triangles: [3]
