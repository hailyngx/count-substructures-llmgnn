Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling the vertices accordingly, the graph can be represented as follows:
Vertices: 1 (degree 2), 5 (degree 1)
Vertices: 2 (degree 2), 8 (degree 2)
Vertices: 0 (degree 3), 6 (degree 4), 3 (degree 4), 7 (degree 4), 9 (degree 2)
  
Based on the edge information provided, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
[Total number of triangles: 4]
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
