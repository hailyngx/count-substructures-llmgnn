Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
0(4), 2(1), 4(2), 5(2), 8(2), 1(3), 7(4), 9(2), 3(3), 6(7)

Starting with the edge (0, 1): Check for shared connections between 0 and 1.
Shared connections: 3, 6
Triangle: <0, 1, 3> 

Moving on to the next edge, (0, 3): Check for shared connections between 0 and 3.
Shared connections: 6
Triangle: <0, 3, 6> 

Edge (0, 6): Check for shared connections between 0 and 6.
Shared connections: 
No triangle found with this edge. 

Skipping edge (1, 0) since we already covered it. 

Edge (1, 7): Check for shared connections between 1 and 7.
Shared connections: 4, 6
Triangle: <1, 7, 4> 

Edge (1, 8): Check for shared connections between 1 and 8.
Shared connections: 
No triangle found with this edge. 

Edge (2, 5): Check for shared connections between 2 and 5.
Shared connections: 
No triangle found with this edge. 

Skipping edge (3, 0) since we already covered it. 

Edge (3, 6): Check for shared connections between 3 and 6.
Shared connections: 
No triangle found with this edge. 

Edge (3, 8): Check for shared connections between 3 and 8.
Shared connections: 
No triangle found with this edge. 

Edge (4, 6): Check for shared connections between 4 and 6.
Shared connections: 7
Triangle: <4, 6, 7> 

Skipping edge (5, 2) since we already covered it. 

Edge (5, 6): Check for shared connections between 5 and 6.
Shared connections: 
No triangle found with this edge. 

Skipping edge (6, 0) since we already covered it. 

Edge (6, 3): Check for shared connections between 6 and 3.
Shared connections: 
No triangle found with this edge. 

Edge (6, 4): Check for shared connections between 6 and 4.
Shared connections: 7
Triangle: <6, 4, 7> 

Edge (6, 5): Check for shared connections between 6 and 5.
Shared connections: 
No triangle found with this edge. 

Edge (6, 7): Check for shared connections between 6 and 7.
Shared connections: 
No triangle found with this edge. 

Skipping edge (6, 9) since we already covered it. 

Skipping edge (7, 1) since we already covered it. 

Edge (7, 4): Check for shared connections between 7 and 4.
Shared connections: 6
Triangle: <7, 4, 6> 

Edge (7, 9): Check for shared connections between 7 and 9.
Shared connections: 
No triangle found with this edge. 

Skipping edge (8, 1) since we already covered it. 

Edge (8, 3): Check for shared connections between 8 and 3.
Shared connections: 
No triangle found with this edge. 

Skipping edge (9, 6) since we already covered it. 

Skipping edge (9, 7) since we already covered it. 

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <1, 7, 4>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 4, 7>, <7, 4, 6>
