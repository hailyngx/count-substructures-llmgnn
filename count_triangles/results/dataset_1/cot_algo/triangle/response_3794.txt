Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, the vertices are relabeled accordingly.

After sorting the vertices, the new vertex labels are:
Node 7 (degree 0) -> relabeled as 0
Node 1 (degree 1) -> relabeled as 1
Node 4 (degree 2) -> relabeled as 2
Node 2 (degree 2) -> relabeled as 3
Node 5 (degree 2) -> relabeled as 4
Node 8 (degree 2) -> relabeled as 5
Node 6 (degree 3) -> relabeled as 6
Node 3 (degree 6) -> relabeled as 7
Node 9 (degree 3) -> relabeled as 8
Node 0 (degree 5) -> relabeled as 9

Now, we can check the edges based on the relabeled vertices and count the triangles:
Triangles:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <3, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
