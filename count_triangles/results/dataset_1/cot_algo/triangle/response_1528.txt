Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, we get the following relabeling:
- Vertex 0 has 1 connection.
- Vertices 2, 5, and 9 have 0 connections.
- Vertices 3, 7, and 6 have 2 connections.
- Vertices 1 and 8 have 4 connections.
- Vertex 4 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Considering edge (0, 1):
   No triangles can be formed since vertex 0 has 1 connection and vertex 1 has 4 connections.

2. Considering edge (1, 4):
   A triangle is formed with vertices <1, 4, 8>.

3. Considering edge (1, 8):
   No triangles can be formed since vertex 1 has 4 connections and vertex 8 also has 4 connections.

4. Considering edge (1, 9):
   No triangles can be formed since vertex 1 has 4 connections and vertex 9 has 0 connections.

5. Considering edge (3, 6):
   No triangles can be formed since vertex 3 has 2 connections and vertex 6 also has 2 connections.

6. Considering edge (3, 7):
   No triangles can be formed since vertex 3 has 2 connections and vertex 7 also has 2 connections.

7. Considering edge (4, 6):
   A triangle is formed with vertices <4, 1, 8>.

8. Considering edge (4, 7):
   A triangle is formed with vertices <4, 1, 8>.

9. Considering edge (4, 8):
   A triangle is formed with vertices <4, 1, 8>.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
