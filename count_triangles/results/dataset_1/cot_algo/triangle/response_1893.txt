Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

- Vertex 7 is not connected to any other vertex
- Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 4 and 8
- Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 6
- Vertex 9 is not connected to any other vertex
- Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 3, 5, 6
- Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1, 8
- Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 1, 2
- Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 1, 4
- Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 4, 5
- Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 0, 3, 8

Now, we relabel the vertices in increasing order of their connections:

- Vertex 7 (0 connections) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 9 (0 connections) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 2 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 0 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 1 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 5 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 6 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 3 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 8 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 4 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 9

Using the sorted vertices, we count the number of triangles:

1. (0, 4): Share 1 connection (Vertex 8)
2. (1, 3): No triangles
3. (1, 5): Share 1 connection (Vertex 8)
4. (1, 6): Share 1 connection (Vertex 4)
5. (2, 6): No triangles
6. (3, 1): No triangles
7. (3, 4): Share 1 connection (Vertex 8)
8. (4, 0): Share 1 connection (Vertex 8)
9. (4, 3): Share 1 connection (Vertex 8)
10. (4, 8): Form a triangle <4, 8, 5>
11. (5, 1): Share 1 connection (Vertex 8)
12. (5, 8): Share 1 connection (Vertex 4)
13. (6, 1): Share 1 connection (Vertex 4)
14. (6, 2): No triangles
15. (8, 4): Share 1 connection (Vertex 5)
16. (8, 5): Share 1 connection (Vertex 4)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1], and the unique triangle found is <4, 8, 5>.
