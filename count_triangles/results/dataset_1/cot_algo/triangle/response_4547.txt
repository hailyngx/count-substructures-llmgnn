Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections. The sorted list of vertices would be: 

Node 1: 1 connection
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections

Now, we will go through each edge according to the method you mentioned:

1. Edge (0, 3): Check for shared connections. Both nodes have connections to nodes 5 and 8, forming a triangle <0, 5, 8>.
2. Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (0, 9): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (3, 0): Already counted with edge (0, 3).
7. Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (3, 8): Check for shared connections. Nodes 5 and 8 are connected to node 3, forming a triangle <3, 5, 8>.
10. Edge (4, 3): Already counted with edge (3, 4).
11. Edge (4, 8): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (5, 0): Already counted with edge (0, 5).
13. Edge (5, 2): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (5, 3): Already counted with edge (3, 5).
15. Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed.
18. Edge (8, 3): Already counted with edge (3, 8).
19. Edge (8, 4): Already counted with edge (4, 8).
20. Edge (8, 7): No triangles formed.
21. Edge (9, 0): Already counted with edge (0, 9).
22. Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 8> and <3, 5, 8>.
