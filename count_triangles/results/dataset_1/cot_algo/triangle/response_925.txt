Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0: Degree 1
Vertex 4: Degree 1
Vertex 9: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 5
Vertex 3: Degree 6
Vertex 7: Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in this graph.

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
