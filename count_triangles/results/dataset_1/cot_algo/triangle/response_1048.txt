Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's list the nodes along with their degrees:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 1

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 1: 0
- Node 4: 1
- Node 6: 2
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 4
- Node 0: 5
- Node 7: 6
- Node 5: 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 2: 9

Now, let's examine the edges following the rules mentioned earlier:

Edge (0, 4) doesn't form a triangle as both nodes have degree 2.
Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with node 3.
Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
Edge (2, 3) forms a triangle with node 5.
Edge (2, 7) forms a triangle with node 5.
Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle with node 3.
Edge (3, 2) forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 7.
Edge (3, 5) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7.
Edge (4, 0) doesn't form a triangle.
Edge (5, 0) forms a triangle with node 3.
Edge (5, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7.
Edge (6, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
Edge (7, 1) does not form a triangle.
Edge (7, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
Edge (8, 2) forms a triangle with node 3.

Count the total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 7>
