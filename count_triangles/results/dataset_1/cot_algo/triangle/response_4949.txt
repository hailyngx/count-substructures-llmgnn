Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied as follows:

Node Degrees:
1. Node 0 - degree 2
2. Node 1 - degree 1
3. Node 2 - degree 3
4. Node 3 - degree 2
5. Node 4 - degree 3
6. Node 5 - degree 3
7. Node 6 - degree 2
8. Node 7 - degree 1
9. Node 8 - degree 2
10. Node 9 - degree 0

Sorted Nodes by Degree:
1. Node 9 (0 connections)
2. Node 1 (1 connection)
3. Node 7 (1 connection)
4. Node 0 (2 connections)
5. Node 8 (2 connections)
6. Node 3 (2 connections)
7. Node 6 (2 connections)
8. Node 2 (3 connections)
9. Node 5 (3 connections)
10. Node 4 (3 connections)

Counting triangles:
- (0, 2) -> shared connection with 8 -> Triangle <0, 2, 8>
- (0, 8) -> shared connection with 4 -> Triangle <0, 8, 4>
- (1, 5) -> No triangles
- (2, 0) -> shared connection with 8 -> Triangle <2, 0, 8>
- (2, 4) -> shared connection with 8 -> Triangle <2, 4, 8>
- (2, 7) -> No triangles
- (3, 5) -> No triangles
- (4, 2) -> shared connection with 8 -> Triangle <4, 2, 8>
- (4, 6) -> shared connection with 5 -> Triangle <4, 6, 5>
- (4, 8) -> No triangles
- (5, 1) -> No triangles
- (5, 3) -> No triangles
- (5, 6) -> shared connection with 4 -> Triangle <5, 6, 4>
- (6, 4) -> shared connection with 5 -> Triangle <6, 4, 5>
- (6, 5) -> shared connection with 4 -> Triangle <6, 5, 4>
- (7, 2) -> No triangles
- (8, 0) -> shared connection with 2 -> Triangle <8, 0, 2>
- (8, 4) -> No triangles

Total number of triangles: [7]
