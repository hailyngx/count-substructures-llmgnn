Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Node Degrees:
0: 2
1: 5
2: 2
3: 1
4: 4
5: 2
6: 2
7: 4
8: 3
9: 6

Sorted by Degrees:
3, 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 4, 7, 1, 9

Triangles:
[3]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1], and the unique triangles found are <3, 0, 2>.
