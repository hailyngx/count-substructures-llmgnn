Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their degree:
```
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
```

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
```
Node 0: 2 connections -> Node 0
Node 1: 2 connections -> Node 1
Node 2: 2 connections -> Node 2
Node 3: 1 connection -> Node 4
Node 4: 3 connections -> Node 3
Node 5: 2 connections -> Node 5
Node 6: 4 connections -> Node 6
Node 7: 2 connections -> Node 7
Node 8: 3 connections -> Node 8
```

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 8): No triangles as Node 0 and Node 8 do not share any connections.
2. Edge (1, 6): Triangle <1, 6, 2>.
3. Edge (1, 7): No triangles between Node 1 and Node 7.
4. Edge (2, 6): Triangle <1, 6, 2>.
5. Edge (2, 7): No triangles between Node 2 and Node 7.
6. Edge (3, 6): Triangle <4, 6, 3>.
7. Edge (4, 5): No triangles between Node 4 and Node 5.
8. Edge (4, 8): Triangle <4, 8, 0>.
9. Edge (5, 4): No triangles between Node 5 and Node 4.
10. Edge (6, 1): Triangle <1, 6, 2>.
11. Edge (6, 2): Triangle <1, 6, 2>.
12. Edge (6, 3): Triangle <4, 6, 3>.
13. Edge (7, 1): No triangles between Node 7 and Node 1.
14. Edge (7, 2): No triangles between Node 7 and Node 2.
15. Edge (8, 0): Triangle <4, 8, 0>.
16. Edge (8, 4): No triangles between Node 8 and Node 4.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles are <1, 6, 2>, <4, 6, 3>, <4, 8, 0>.
