Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 0: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 9: Degree 7

We will relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 0 (Degree 3) -> Node 0 (Degree 3)
Node 2 (Degree 2) -> Node 1 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 1) -> Node 2 (Degree 1)
Node 7 (Degree 3) -> Node 3 (Degree 3)
Node 8 (Degree 3) -> Node 4 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 6) -> Node 5 (Degree 6)
Node 5 (Degree 4) -> Node 6 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 5) -> Node 7 (Degree 5)
Node 3 (Degree 6) -> Node 8 (Degree 6)
Node 9 (Degree 7) -> Node 9 (Degree 7)

Now we will go through each edge to count the triangles:

(0, 1): No triangles
(0, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 5>
(0, 5): No triangles
(1, 5): No triangles
(1, 7): No triangles
(1, 8): No triangles
(1, 9): No triangles
(2, 3): No triangles
(2, 9): No triangles
(3, 6): No triangles
(4, 6): No triangles
(5, 6): Triangle <0, 5, 6>
(6, 7): Triangle <3, 6, 7>
(6, 8): No triangles
(6, 9): Triangle <5, 6, 9>
(7, 9): No triangles
(8, 9): Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
