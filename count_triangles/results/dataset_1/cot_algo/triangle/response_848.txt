Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each vertex:

- Vertex 1 has degree 3
- Vertex 2 has degree 4
- Vertex 3 has degree 1
- Vertex 4 has degree 3
- Vertex 5 has degree 2
- Vertex 7 has degree 2
- Vertex 8 has degree 1
- Vertex 9 has degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can relabel the vertices as follows:
- Vertex 3 (degree 1) becomes vertex 1
- Vertices 5 and 7 (degree 2) become vertices 2 and 3 (in any order)
- Vertex 8 (degree 1) becomes vertex 4
- Vertices 1, 4, and 9 (degree 3 and 4) become vertices 5, 6, and 7 (in any order)

The new edge list becomes: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3)

Now, let's count the triangles formed:

- Triangle <1, 5, 6>
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle <2, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
