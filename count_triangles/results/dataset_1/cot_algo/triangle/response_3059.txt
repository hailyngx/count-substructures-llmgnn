Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 3 (degree 1)  
Node 5 (degree 1)  
Node 6 (degree 2)  
Node 9 (degree 2)  
Node 4 (degree 3)  
Node 1 (degree 4)  
Node 2 (degree 4)  
Node 0 (degree 5)  
Node 8 (degree 6)  
Node 7 (degree 6)  

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

- Edge (0, 1): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (0, 6): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (0, 7): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (0, 8): Shared connections: [ ]  
- Edge (1, 2): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (1, 4): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (2, 7): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (2, 8): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (2, 9): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (3, 5): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (3, 7): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (3, 8): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (4, 6): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (4, 7): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (5, 8): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (7, 8): Shared connections: [ ]
- Edge (8, 9): Shared connections: [ ]

The total number of triangles is: [0]

Therefore, the graph does not contain any triangles.
