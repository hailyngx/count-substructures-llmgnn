Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new ordering is as follows:
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles by following the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

We find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 2>
<4, 8, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
