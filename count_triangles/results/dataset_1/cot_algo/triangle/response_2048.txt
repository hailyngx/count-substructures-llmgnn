Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding degrees are as follows:
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 0
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 0
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 10: Degree 0

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering Method, we relabel the nodes as follows:
Node 2: 0
Node 7: 1
Node 9: 2
Node 1: 3
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 5
Node 3: 6
Node 4: 7
Node 8: 8
Node 10: 9

After relabeling, the edges are as follows:
(0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8)

Now, we count the triangles:
- Triangle <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
