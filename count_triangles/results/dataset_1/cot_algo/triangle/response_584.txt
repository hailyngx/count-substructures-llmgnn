Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree in increasing order:
- Node 2: 1
- Node 4: 1
- Node 7: 1
- Node 3: 2
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 2
- Node 0: 3

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will only consider edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections. Let's analyze the edges accordingly:

- (2, 6): Forms a triangle with (3, 6) since they share node 6: <2, 3, 6>
- (4, 0): Forms a triangle with (0, 3) since they share node 0: <0, 3, 4>
- (4, 0): Forms a triangle with (0, 5) since they share node 0: <0, 4, 5>
- (5, 8): No triangle formed
- (8, 9): No triangle formed
- (9, 7): No triangle formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 6> and <0, 3, 4>.
