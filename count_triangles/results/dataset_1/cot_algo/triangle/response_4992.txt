Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 3): 
   Node 0 and Node 3 do not have fewer connections than each other, so we do not proceed with this edge.

2. Edge (0, 6):
   Node 0 (2 connections) has fewer connections than Node 6 (3 connections).
   Shared connections between Node 0 and Node 6: 4
   Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>

3. Edge (1, 3):
   Since Node 1 and Node 3 have the same number of connections, we do not proceed with this edge.

4. Edge (1, 4):
   Node 1 (3 connections) has fewer connections than Node 4 (6 connections).
   Shared connections between Node 1 and Node 4: 1, 8
   Triangles formed: <1, 4, 8>

5. Edge (1, 7):
   Node 1 and Node 7 do not have fewer connections than each other, so we do not proceed with this edge.

6. Edge (2, 4):
   Since Node 2 and Node 4 have the same number of connections, we do not proceed with this edge.

7. Edge (2, 9):
   Node 2 (3 connections) has fewer connections than Node 9 (4 connections).
   Shared connections between Node 2 and Node 9: None

The total number of triangles is [2].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6> and <1, 4, 8>.
