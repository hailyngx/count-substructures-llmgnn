Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 7 is not present in the edge list, so it has 0 connections.
Sorting nodes by the number of connections:
Nodes: 7, 0, 1, 9, 5, 8, 3, 6, 2, 4
Connections: 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 7 (0 connections) -> relabeled as 0
Node 0 (3 connections) -> relabeled as 1
Node 1 (3 connections) -> relabeled as 2
Node 9 (3 connections) -> relabeled as 3
Node 5 (3 connections) -> relabeled as 4
Node 8 (3 connections) -> relabeled as 5
Node 3 (3 connections) -> relabeled as 6
Node 6 (4 connections) -> relabeled as 7
Node 2 (4 connections) -> relabeled as 8
Node 4 (5 connections) -> relabeled as 9

Now, we proceed with the counting of triangles:
Triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 8, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 5>, <6, 8, 5>

Total number of triangles: [8]
