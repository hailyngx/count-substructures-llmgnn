Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, we have the following labels for the vertices:
Node 2 (Degree 1)  
Node 5 (Degree 2)  
Node 6 (Degree 2)  
Node 8 (Degree 2)  
Node 9 (Degree 2)  
Node 1 (Degree 3)  
Node 7 (Degree 4)  
Node 0 (Degree 6)  
Node 4 (Degree 4)  
Node 3 (Degree 6)  

Now, we will examine the edges based on the degree-based ordering:

For the edge (2, 3) we have Node 2 < Node 3, but Node 2 has fewer connections so we proceed. No triangles are formed.
For the edge (0, 3) we have Node 0 < Node 3, but Node 0 has more connections so we skip.
For the edge (5, 9) we have Node 5 < Node 9, and Node 5 has fewer connections, so we check for shared connections. Node 5 and Node 9 have a shared connection with Node 0, forming a triangle <0, 5, 9>.
(Continuing similarly for all edges)
For the edge (9, 7) we have Node 9 < Node 7, and Node 9 has fewer connections, so we check for shared connections. Node 9 and Node 7 have a shared connection with Node 1, forming a triangle <1, 7, 9>.

Counting all the triangles found, we get a total of 3 triangles.

Therefore, the answer is: [3]
