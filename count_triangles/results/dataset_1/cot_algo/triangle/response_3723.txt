Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows:
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections
Vertex 2: 8 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
Therefore, we will consider the following edges:
(1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 9), (3, 4), (3, 9)

By checking for shared connections, we find there are 3 triangles:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
