Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 1: 1 connection
Node 3: 0 connection
Node 5: 0 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections

Now, we proceed with counting the triangles:
- Edge (0, 4) is ignored since node 0 has more connections than node 4.
- Edge (0, 6) is ignored since node 0 has more connections than node 6.
- Edge (0, 8) is ignored since node 0 has more connections than node 8.
- Edge (1, 9) is considered as both nodes have fewer connections.
  - Shared connection: Node 9
- Edge (2, 6) is ignored since node 6 has more connections than node 2.
- Edge (2, 7) is considered as both nodes have fewer connections.
  - Shared connection: Node 9
- Edge (2, 9) is considered as both nodes have fewer connections.
  - Shared connection: Node 6
- Edge (4, 0) is ignored since node 0 has more connections than node 4.
- Edge (6, 0) is ignored since node 0 has more connections than node 6.
- Edge (6, 2) is considered as both nodes have fewer connections.
  - Shared connection: Node 9
- Edge (6, 9) is considered as both nodes have fewer connections.
  - Shared connection: Node 2
- Edge (7, 2) is considered as both nodes have fewer connections.
  - Shared connection: Node 9
- Edge (8, 0) is ignored since node 0 has more connections than node 8.
- Edge (9, 1) is considered as both nodes have fewer connections.
  - Shared connection: Node 9
- Edge (9, 2) is considered as both nodes have fewer connections.
  - Shared connection: Node 6

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <6, 2, 9>, <6, 9, 1>, <7, 2, 9>
