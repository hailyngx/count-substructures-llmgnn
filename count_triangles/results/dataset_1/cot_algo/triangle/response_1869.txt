Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps to count triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
   - Vertex 0: 2 connections
   - Vertex 1: 3 connections
   - Vertex 4: 1 connection
   - Vertex 5: 2 connections
   - Vertex 3: 3 connections
   - Vertex 6: 3 connections
   - Vertex 8: 3 connections
   - Vertex 9: 4 connections
   - Vertex 7: 4 connections
   - Vertex 2: 5 connections

2. Relabel the vertices according to their sorted degrees:
   - Vertex 0 (2 connections) -> Vertex 0
   - Vertex 1 (3 connections) -> Vertex 1
   - Vertex 4 (1 connection) -> Vertex 2
   - Vertex 5 (2 connections) -> Vertex 3
   - Vertex 3 (3 connections) -> Vertex 4
   - Vertex 6 (3 connections) -> Vertex 5
   - Vertex 8 (3 connections) -> Vertex 6
   - Vertex 9 (4 connections) -> Vertex 7
   - Vertex 7 (4 connections) -> Vertex 8
   - Vertex 2 (5 connections) -> Vertex 9

3. Count the triangles using the sorted vertices and edges:
   - Triangles:
     1. <0, 1, 2>
     2. <0, 2, 6>
     3. <0, 2, 7>
     4. <0, 2, 8>
     5. <1, 2, 7>
     6. <1, 2, 8>
     7. <3, 5, 6>
     8. <3, 5, 7>
     9. <3, 6, 7>
     10. <5, 6, 7>
     11. <8, 9, 7>
     12. <8, 9, 2>
     13. <9, 0, 2>
   
   The total number of triangles is [13].
