Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 5

Vertices sorted by degree in ascending order:
Node 4, Node 5, Node 0, Node 2, Node 8, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, Node 1, Node 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 1): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (0, 6): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (1, 0): Skip as node 0 has lower degree
- Edge (1, 3): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (1, 6): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (1, 7): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (1, 9): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (2, 3): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (3, 1): Skip as node 1 has higher degree
- Edge (3, 2): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (3, 7): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (3, 9): Check shared connections - Triangle <1, 3, 9>
- Edge (4, 6): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (5, 8): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (6, 0): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (6, 1): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (6, 4): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (6, 9): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (7, 1): Skip as node 1 has higher degree
- Edge (7, 3): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (7, 8): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (7, 9): Check shared connections - Triangle <1, 7, 9>
- Edge (8, 5): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (8, 7): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (9, 1): Skip as node 1 has higher degree
- Edge (9, 3): Check shared connections - Triangle <1, 9, 3>
- Edge (9, 6): Check shared connections - None
- Edge (9, 7): Triangle <1, 9, 7>

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <1, 3, 9>, <1, 7, 9>
