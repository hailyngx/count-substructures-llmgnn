Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 6: 0 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertices 1, 5: 2 connections
Vertices 4, 3: 3 connections
Vertices 0, 9: 4 connections
Vertices 2, 6: 5 connections
Vertices 7, 8: 6 connections

Now, counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- For edges (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 7), we find the triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- For edges (1, 2), (2, 8), we find the triangle <1, 2, 8>.
- For edges (2, 7), (7, 0), we find the triangle <0, 2, 7>.
- For edges (4, 7), (7, 3), we find the triangle <3, 4, 7>.
- For edges (5, 8), (8, 4), we find the triangle <4, 5, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
