Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are:  

Vertex 8 has degree 1.  
Vertex 6 has degree 1.  
Vertex 0 has degree 3.  
Vertex 1 has degree 3.  
Vertex 6 has degree 3.  
Vertex 4 has degree 3.  
Vertex 8 has degree 4.  
Vertex 5 has degree 4.  
Vertex 7 has degree 5.   
Vertex 9 has degree 6.  

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

Using the sorted vertices, we can find the triangles:  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 2, 7>  
<1, 2, 3>  
<2, 4, 5>  
<2, 5, 9>  
<3, 7, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
