Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows: 

Vertex 2: 0 connections
Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph.

We start by examining the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 1): No triangles formed.
2. Edge (0, 5): Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>.
3. Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (3, 4): Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>.
5. Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (5, 9): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2], and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 5> and <3, 4, 5>.
