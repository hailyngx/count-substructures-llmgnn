Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph. The vertices are relabeled based on their degrees:

Vertices in increasing order of degrees:
0 (degree 4), 2 (degree 2), 4 (degree 1), 7 (degree 4), 9 (degree 2), 1 (degree 4), 5 (degree 4), 8 (degree 4), 3 (degree 3), 6 (degree 4)

Edges that will be processed based on the Degree-Based Ordering:
(2, 5), (4, 7), (9, 5), (2, 6), (3, 8), (8, 9), (3, 5), (5, 9), (1, 8), (6, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (5, 3), (6, 0), (7, 4), (3, 0), (7, 1), (1, 0), (8, 6), (1, 6), (6, 2), (7, 0), (0, 1), (8, 3), (1, 7), (6, 1), (9, 8), (0, 3), (0, 7)

After processing the edges, the total number of triangles found is [8] and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 9>.
