Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 0, 3, 4, 9, 6

Next, we examine each edge in the graph while considering the lower labeled vertex first if both vertices don't have the same degree. 

Edges that contribute to triangles: 
- (0, 1) forms a triangle with 3: <0, 1, 3>
- (0, 3) forms a triangle with 1: <0, 3, 1>
- (0, 6) does not form a triangle as vertex 6 has higher degree
- (0, 8) does not form a triangle as both vertices have the same degree
- (1, 3) forms a triangle with 0: <1, 3, 0>
- (3, 4) forms a triangle with 5: <3, 4, 5>
- (3, 8) forms a triangle with 0: <3, 8, 0>
- (3, 9) forms a triangle with 6: <3, 9, 6>
- (4, 5) forms a triangle with 3: <4, 5, 3>
- (4, 7) forms a triangle with 0: <4, 7, 0>
- (6, 9) forms a triangle with 0: <6, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 8, 0>, <3, 9, 6>, <4, 5, 3>, <4, 7, 0>, and <6, 9, 3>.
