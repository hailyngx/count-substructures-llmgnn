Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Vertex \#2 has 1 connection.
- Vertex \#4 has 1 connection.
- Vertex \#6 has 1 connection.
- Vertex \#9 has 1 connection.
- Vertex \#0 has 2 connections.
- Vertex \#5 has 2 connections.
- Vertex \#7 has 3 connections.
- Vertex \#1 has 5 connections.
- Vertex \#3 has 2 connections.
- Vertex \#8 has 7 connections.

Sorted vertices by number of connections: 2, 4, 6, 9, 0, 5, 3, 7, 1, 8.

After relabelling the vertices accordingly, we can count the triangles:

Triangles: 
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <1, 3, 8>
3. <1, 5, 8>
4. <1, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [4]
