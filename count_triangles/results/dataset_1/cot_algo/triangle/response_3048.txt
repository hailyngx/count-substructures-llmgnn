Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2

Now, we will sort the nodes based on degree in ascending order:
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4

Next, we will traverse each edge and count the number of triangles formed:
- Edge (0, 2) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (0, 7) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 0) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 7) - Triangle <2, 4, 7> is formed.
- Edge (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 5) - Triangle <4, 5, 2> is formed.
- Edge (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 2) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 4) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 3) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 4) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 0) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 2) - Triangle <7, 2, 4> is formed.
- Edge (7, 4) - No triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 6) - No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <2, 4, 7>, <7, 2, 4>
