Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
Vertex 8: 0 connections 
Vertex 1: 1 connection 
Vertex 6: 1 connection 
Vertex 9: 1 connection 
Vertex 0: 4 connections 
Vertex 4: 4 connections 
Vertex 5: 5 connections 
Vertex 2: 5 connections 
Vertex 7: 5 connections 
Vertex 3: 6 connections 

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Using this method, we can identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
7. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
8. Triangle <4, 5, 7>

After counting all the triangles, the total number of triangles is [8].
