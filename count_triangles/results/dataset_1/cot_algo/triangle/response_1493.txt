Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 8 has 1 connection.
- Vertices 5 and 4 have 2 connections each.
- Vertices 1 and 5 have 3 connections each.
- Vertices 0, 6, and 7 have 4 connections each.
- Vertex 2 has 5 connections.
- Vertex 3 has 6 connections.
- Vertex 9 has 7 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now look at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 4): Shared connection with vertex 6. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
2. Edge (0, 6): Shared connections with vertices 4 and 7. Triangles formed: <0, 4, 6> and <0, 6, 7>.
3. Edge (0, 7): Shared connection with vertex 6. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>.
4. Edge (0, 9): No triangle formed as vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
5. Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed as both vertices 1 and 2 have the same number of connections.
6. Edge (1, 3): Shared connections with vertices 2 and 9. Triangles formed: <1, 2, 3> and <1, 3, 9>.
7. Edge (1, 8): No triangle formed as vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 8.
8. Edge (1, 9): Shared connection with vertex 3. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 9>.
9. Edge (2, 1): No triangle formed as vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 2.
10. Edge (2, 3): Shared connection with vertex 9. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 9>.
11. Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed as vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 5.
12. Edge (2, 7): Shared connection with vertex 6. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>.
13. Edge (3, 1): No triangle formed as vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 3.
14. Edge (3, 2): No triangle formed as both vertices 2 and 3 have the same number of connections.
15. Edge (3, 6): Shared connections with vertices 0, 4, and 7. Triangles formed: <0, 4, 6> and <0, 6, 7> and <3, 6, 7>.
16. Edge (3, 7): Shared connections with vertices 0, 6, and 9. Triangles formed: <0, 6, 7> and <3, 6, 7> and <1, 3, 9>.
17. Edge (3, 9): No triangle formed as vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
18. Edge (4, 0): No triangle formed as vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 4.
19. Edge (4, 6): Shared connection with vertex 0. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
20. Edge (4, 9): Shared connection with vertices 0 and 6. Triangles formed: <0, 4, 6> and <0, 6, 7>.
21. Edge (5, 2): No triangle formed as vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 5.
22. Edge (6, 0): No triangle formed as vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 6.
23. Edge (6, 3): Shared connections with vertices 0, 4, and 7. Triangles formed: <0, 4, 6> and <0, 6, 7> and <3, 6, 7>.
24. Edge (6, 4): Shared connection with vertex 0. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
25. Edge (6, 7): Shared connections with vertices 0, 2, and 3. Triangles formed: <0, 6, 7> and <3, 6, 7> and <0, 6, 7>.
26. Edge (6, 9): Shared connections with vertices 0, 3, and 4. Triangles formed: <0, 4, 6> and <0, 6, 7> and <1, 3, 9>.
27. Edge (7, 0): No triangle formed as vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 7.
28. Edge (7, 2): No triangle formed as vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 7.
29. Edge (7, 3): Shared connections with vertices 0, 3, and 6. Triangles formed: <0, 6, 7> and <3, 6, 7> and <0, 6, 7>.
30. Edge (7, 6): Shared connections with vertices 0, 2, and 3. Triangles formed: <0, 6, 7> and <3, 6, 7> and <0, 6, 7>.
31. Edge (8, 1): No triangle formed as vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 8.
32. Edge (8, 9): No triangle formed as vertex 8 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
33. Edge (9, 0): No triangle formed as vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
34. Edge (9, 1): No triangle formed as vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
35. Edge (9, 3): No triangle formed as vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
36. Edge (9, 4): No triangle formed as vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
37. Edge (9, 6): No triangle formed as vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
38. Edge (9, 8): No triangle formed as vertex 8 has fewer connections than vertex 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5], and the unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, and <3, 6, 7>.
