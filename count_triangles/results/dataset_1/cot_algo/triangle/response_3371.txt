Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertices: 2, 7, 1, 5, 6, 0, 9, 4, 3, 8

Now we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (0, 1): Shared connections with 4 form a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 3): Shared connections with 6 form two triangles <0, 3, 6> and <0, 3, 4>.
3. Edge (0, 4): Shared connections with 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9 form five triangles <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, and <0, 6, 4>.
4. Edge (0, 6): Shared connections with 3 and 4 form two triangles <0, 3, 6> and <0, 6, 4>.
5. Edge (0, 8): No triangles can be formed as the vertex with lower label (0) does not have fewer connections.
6. Edge (1, 4): Shared connections with 0 form a triangle <1, 4, 0>.
7. Edge (2, 6): No triangles can be formed as the vertex with lower label (2) does not have fewer connections.
8. Edge (3, 5): Shared connections with 4 form a triangle <3, 5, 4>.
9. Edge (3, 9): Shared connections with 4 form a triangle <3, 9, 4>.
10. Edge (4, 5): Shared connections with 3 form a triangle <4, 5, 3>.
11. Edge (4, 6): Shared connections with 0 form a triangle <4, 6, 0>.
12. Edge (4, 7): Shared connections with 8 form a triangle <4, 7, 8>.
13. Edge (4, 9): Shared connections with 0, 3, and 5 form three triangles <4, 9, 0>, <4, 9, 3>, and <4, 9, 5>.
14. Edge (5, 3): Shared connections with 4 form a triangle <5, 3, 4>.
15. Edge (6, 0): Shared connections with 4 form a triangle <6, 0, 4>.
16. Edge (6, 2): No triangles can be formed as the vertex with lower label (2) does not have fewer connections.
17. Edge (6, 4): Shared connections with 0 form a triangle <6, 4, 0>.
18. Edge (7, 4): Shared connections with 8 form a triangle <7, 4, 8>.
19. Edge (7, 8): Shared connections with 4 form a triangle <7, 8, 4>.
20. Edge (8, 0): No triangles can be formed as the vertex with lower label (8) does not have fewer connections.
21. Edge (8, 7): No triangles can be formed as the vertex with lower label (7) does not have fewer connections.
22. Edge (8, 9): Shared connections with 4 form a triangle <8, 9, 4>.
23. Edge (9, 3): Shared connections with 4 form a triangle <9, 3, 4>.
24. Edge (9, 4): Shared connections with 0 and 3 form two triangles <9, 4, 0> and <9, 4, 3>.

Total number of triangles: [16]
