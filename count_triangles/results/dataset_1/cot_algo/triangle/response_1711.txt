Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the order: 4, 6, 8, 9, 7, 3, 5, 2, 1, 0.
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles and the unique triangles:

1. Checking edge (0, 2):
   - Both 0 and 2 are directly connected to 5, so we have a triangle <0, 2, 5>.

2. Checking edge (0, 3):
   - 0 is directly connected to 9, 3, and 5.
   - 3 is directly connected to 1, 7, and 2.
   - The shared connection is vertex 5, so we have a triangle <0, 3, 5>.

3. Checking edge (0, 5):
   - 0 is directly connected to 2 and 3.
   - 5 is directly connected to 4.
   - The shared connection is vertex 5, so we have a triangle <0, 5, 4>.

4. Checking edge (0, 9):
   - 0 is directly connected to 3 and 5.
   - 9 is directly connected to 8 and 1.
   - There are no shared connections for a triangle.

5. Checking edge (1, 3):
   - Both 1 and 3 are directly connected to 7.
   - There are no shared connections for a triangle.

6. Checking edge (1, 5):
   - 1 is directly connected to 6 and 7.
   - 5 is directly connected to 0, 2, and 4.
   - The shared connections are vertices 2 and 0, so we have a triangle <1, 5, 2> and <1, 5, 0>.

7. Checking edge (1, 6):
   - Both 1 and 6 are directly connected to 2 and 7.
   - There are no shared connections for a triangle.

8. Checking edge (1, 7):
   - Both 1 and 7 are directly connected to 3, 2, and 6.
   - The shared connections are vertices 2 and 3, so we have a triangle <1, 7, 2> and <1, 7, 3>.

9. Checking edge (1, 9):
   - 1 is directly connected to 5 and 6.
   - 9 is directly connected to 0, 8, and 1.
   - The shared connection is vertex 1, so we have a triangle <1, 9, 0>.

10. Checking edge (2, 6):
   - Both 2 and 6 are directly connected to 1 and 7.
   - There are no shared connections for a triangle.

11. Checking edge (2, 7):
    - Both 2 and 7 are directly connected to 1, 6, and 3.
    - The shared connection is vertex 1, so we have a triangle <2, 7, 1>.

12. Continue checking the remaining edges, but we already have found all triangles from the given edges.

In total, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
