Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.

Relabeling the nodes according to their number of connections in ascending order:
Node 6 (1 connection)
Node 0 (2 connections)
Node 4 (2 connections)
Node 7 (2 connections)
Node 1 (3 connections)
Node 8 (3 connections)
Node 5 (4 connections)
Node 2 (4 connections)
Node 3 (5 connections)
Node 9 (5 connections)

Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
(0, 9) - Both have 2 connections. No triangle.
(1, 3) - (1, 3, 5) form a triangle.
(1, 9) - (1, 9, 7) form a triangle.
(2, 3) - (2, 3, 1) form a triangle.
(2, 6) - Both have 1 connection. No triangle.
(2, 7) - (2, 7, 9) form a triangle.
(3, 1) - (3, 1, 9) form a triangle.
(3, 2) - (3, 2, 6) form a triangle.
(3, 5) - No triangle.
(3, 8) - (3, 8, 5) form a triangle.
(4, 5) - (4, 5, 8) form a triangle.
(4, 9) - (4, 9, 1) form a triangle.
(5, 3) - No triangle.
(5, 8) - (5, 8, 3) form a triangle.
(6, 2) - No triangle.
(7, 2) - No triangle.
(7, 9) - (7, 9, 1) form a triangle.
(8, 3) - (8, 3, 1) form a triangle.
(9, 0) - Both have 2 connections. No triangle.
(9, 1) - (9, 1, 3) form a triangle.
(9, 4) - No triangle.
(9, 7) - (9, 7, 2) form a triangle.
