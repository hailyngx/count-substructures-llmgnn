Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices: 0(2), 1(2), 2(3), 3(1), 4(4), 5(1), 6(4), 7(2), 8(2), 9(3)

Now, we start counting the triangles:

For edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 and Vertex 3 have no common neighbors.

For edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 and Vertex 6 have 1 common neighbor (4), forming a triangle <0, 4, 6>.

For edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 and Vertex 4 have no common neighbors.

For edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 and Vertex 6 have no common neighbors.

For edge (2, 5): Vertex 2 and Vertex 5 have no common neighbors.

For edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 and Vertex 7 have no common neighbors.

For edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 and Vertex 9 have 1 common neighbor (4), forming a triangle <2, 4, 9>.

For edge (3, 0): Not considering it as the lower labeled vertex doesn't have fewer connections.

For edge (4, 1): Not considering it as the lower labeled vertex doesn't have fewer connections.

For edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 and Vertex 6 have 1 common neighbor (0), forming a triangle <0, 4, 6>.

For edge (4, 8): Vertex 4 and Vertex 8 have no common neighbors.

For edge (4, 9): Vertex 4 and Vertex 9 have no common neighbors.

For edge (5, 2): Not considering it as the lower labeled vertex doesn't have fewer connections.

For edge (6, 0): Not considering it as the lower labeled vertex doesn't have fewer connections.

For edge (6, 1): Not considering it as the lower labeled vertex doesn't have fewer connections.

For edge (6, 4): Vertex 6 and Vertex 4 have 1 common neighbor (0), forming a triangle <0, 4, 6>.

For edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 and Vertex 8 have no common neighbors.

For edge (7, 2): Not considering it as the lower labeled vertex doesn't have fewer connections.

For edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 and Vertex 9 have no common neighbors.

For edge (8, 4): Not considering it as the lower labeled vertex doesn't have fewer connections.

For edge (8, 6): Vertex 8 and Vertex 6 have no common neighbors.

For edge (9, 2): Not considering it as the lower labeled vertex doesn't have fewer connections.

For edge (9, 4): Not considering it as the lower labeled vertex doesn't have fewer connections.

For edge (9, 7): Vertex 9 and Vertex 7 have no common neighbors.

After counting all possible triangles, we find the total number of triangles = [2].

The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6> and <2, 4, 9>.
