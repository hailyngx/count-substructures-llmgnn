Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, so we have the following updated labels for each node:

Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 1
Node 2: Degree 1
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 7
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 3

Using the given edges and the degree-based ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:

Triangles:
1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <3, 5, 6>
3. <3, 6, 7>
4. <4, 6, 7>
5. <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
