Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method begins by sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 6: degree 1
Node 5: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 7: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 8: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5

The relabeled vertices become:

Node 6: degree 1
Node 0: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5

Using the sorted vertices, we will now count the number of triangles:

1. Checking (0, 1): Node 0 and Node 1 do not share a neighbor.
2. Checking (0, 5): Node 0 and Node 5 do not share a neighbor.
3. Checking (1, 3): Node 1 and Node 3 do not share a neighbor.
4. Checking (1, 6): Node 1 and Node 6 do not share a neighbor.
5. Checking (1, 7): Node 1 and Node 7 do not share a neighbor.
6. Checking (2, 3): Node 2 and Node 3 share Node 8 -> <2, 3, 8>
7. Checking (2, 7): Node 2 and Node 7 do not share a neighbor.
8. Checking (3, 4): Node 3 and Node 4 share Node 8 -> <3, 4, 8>
9. Checking (3, 8): Node 3 and Node 8 share Node 4 -> <3, 4, 8>
10. Checking (4, 8): Node 4 and Node 8 share Node 3 -> <3, 4, 8>
11. Checking (5, 8): Node 5 and Node 8 do not share a neighbor.
12. Checking (6, 9): Node 6 and Node 9 do not share a neighbor.
13. Checking (7, 8): Node 7 and Node 8 share Nodes 2 and 3 -> <2, 7, 8> and <3, 7, 8>
14. Checking (8, 9): Node 8 and Node 9 do not share a neighbor.

Finally, the total number of triangles is [6] as shown above.
