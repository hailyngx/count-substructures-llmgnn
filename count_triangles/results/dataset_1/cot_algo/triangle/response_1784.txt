Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices and their corresponding degrees:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 0
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 1
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 0

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node 1: degree 0
Node 9: degree 0
Node 4: degree 1
Node 2: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4

Next, we'll check the edges according to the degree-based ordering. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (2, 6): Forms a triangle <2, 6, 7>
- Edge (3, 4): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 6): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (0, 7): Forms a triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (6, 7): Forms a triangle <2, 6, 7>
- Edge (6, 8): Forms a triangle <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, and <2, 6, 8>.
