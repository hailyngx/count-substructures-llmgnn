Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we can relabel them as follows:
Node 7 (Degree 0)
Node 8 (Degree 0)
Node 9 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 3)
Node 6 (Degree 4)
Node 2 (Degree 3)
Node 5 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 4 (Degree 6)
Node 1 (Degree 4)

Now, we will count the triangles present in the graph:
Triangles present: 12
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
