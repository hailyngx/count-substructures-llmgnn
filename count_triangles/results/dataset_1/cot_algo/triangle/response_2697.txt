Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new node labeling is as follows: 

Node 2: degree 4
Node 5: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 0: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we examine each edge for shared connections to count triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [17] and the unique triangles found are <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 4>, <9, 1, 4>, <9, 1, 7>, <5, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 4>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 8, 4>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 7>, <7, 8, 4>.
