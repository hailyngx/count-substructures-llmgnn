Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order and then relabeling them accordingly.

The sorted vertices with their degrees are as follows:
(9: 2), (0: 4), (1: 3), (7: 2), (4: 3), (8: 5), (6: 4), (2: 5), (5: 5), (3: 6)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles.

Triangles:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [11]
