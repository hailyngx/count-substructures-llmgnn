Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 9, 1, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles by following the given edges:

1. Edge (0, 4): No triangles can be formed.
2. Edge (0, 7): No triangles can be formed.
3. Edge (1, 5): No triangles can be formed.
4. Edge (2, 3): No triangles can be formed.
5. Edge (2, 5): Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>.
6. Edge (3, 5):  No additional triangles can be formed.
7. Edge (3, 6): No additional triangles can be formed.
8. Edge (4, 0): No additional triangles can be formed.
9. Edge (4, 7): No additional triangles can be formed.
10. Edge (5, 1): No additional triangles can be formed.
11. Edge (5, 2): No additional triangles can be formed.
12. Edge (5, 3):  No additional triangles can be formed.
13. Edge (5, 6): Triangle formed: <3, 5, 6>.
14. Edge (6, 3): No additional triangles can be formed.
15. Edge (6, 5):  No additional triangles can be formed.
16. Edge (6, 9): No additional triangles can be formed.
17. Edge (7, 0): No additional triangles can be formed.
18. Edge (7, 4): No additional triangles can be formed.
19. Edge (9, 6): No additional triangles can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are: <2, 3, 5> and <3, 5, 6>.
