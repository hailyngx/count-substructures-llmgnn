Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the labels for the vertices are as follows:
(3, 4, 0, 7, 1, 2, 5, 9, 8, 6)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 6):
    - Both vertices have 3 common neighbors (2, 4, 5). So, triangle <0, 2, 4> is found.

2. Edge (0, 8):
    - Both vertices have 3 common neighbors (5, 6, 9). So, triangle <0, 5, 9> is found.

3. Edge (0, 9):
    - Both vertices have 3 common neighbors (5, 6, 8). So, triangle <0, 5, 8> is found.

4. Edge (1, 7):
    - No triangles formed.

5. Edge (1, 9):
    - No triangles formed.

6. Edge (2, 5):
    - Both vertices have 3 common neighbors (0, 6, 9). So, triangle <2, 0, 6> is found.

7. Edge (2, 6):
    - Both vertices have 3 common neighbors (0, 4, 5). So, triangle <2, 0, 4> is found.

8. Edge (4, 6):
    - Both vertices have 3 common neighbors (0, 2, 5). So, triangle <4, 0, 2> is found.

9. Edge (5, 2):
    - No need to count again as we've already counted this triangle with edge (2, 5).

10. Edge (5, 6):
    - No need to count again as we've already counted this triangle with edge (2, 6) and (0, 6).

11. Edge (5, 8):
    - No triangles formed.

12. Edge (5, 9):
    - No need to count again as we've already counted this triangle with edge (0, 9).

13. Edge (6, 0):
    - No need to count again as we've already counted this triangle with edge (0, 6) and (4, 6).

14. Edge (6, 2):
    - No need to count again as we've already counted this triangle with edge (2, 6).

15. Edge (6, 4):
    - No need to count again as we've already counted this triangle with edge (4, 6).

16. Edge (6, 5):
    - No need to count again as we've already counted this triangle with edge (5, 6).

17. Edge (7, 1):
    - No triangles formed.

18. Edge (7, 8):
    - No triangles formed.

19. Edge (8, 0):
    - No need to count again as we've already counted this triangle with edge (0, 8).

20. Edge (8, 5):
    - No need to count again as we've already counted this triangle with edge (0, 8).

21. Edge (8, 7):
    - No triangles formed.

22. Edge (9, 0):
    - No need to count again as we've already counted this triangle with edge (0, 9).

23. Edge (9, 1):
    - No triangles formed.

24. Edge (9, 5):
    - No need to count again as we've already counted this triangle with edge (0, 9).

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
