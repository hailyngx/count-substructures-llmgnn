Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Considering the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices:  
1. 1 connection: 1, 7 
2. 2 connections: 6 
3. 3 connections: 2, 5 
4. 4 connections: 2, 5 
5. 5 connections: 0, 4, 8 
6. 6 connections: 3, 9 

Now, let's proceed with counting the triangles:

For the edge (0, 3):
- This edge satisfies the condition because vertex 0 has 3 connections while vertex 3 has 6 connections.
- We find that vertex 0 and vertex 3 have 1 common connection: vertex 9.
- Therefore, we have a triangle formed by vertices 0, 3, and 9.

For the edge (0, 4):
- This edge satisfies the condition because vertex 0 has 5 connections while vertex 4 has 4 connections.
- We find that vertex 0 and vertex 4 have 1 common connection: vertex 9.
- Therefore, we have another triangle formed by vertices 0, 4, and 9.

For the rest of the edges, none of them satisfy the conditions for forming triangles based on the degree ordering.

As a result, we have found 2 triangles in the given graph:

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
