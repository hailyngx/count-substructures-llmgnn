Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the order will be: 1, 0, 7, 6, 9, 5, 4, 3, 8, 2.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and examining each edge, we find the following triangles: 
- <2, 1, 3>
- <0, 4, 2>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
