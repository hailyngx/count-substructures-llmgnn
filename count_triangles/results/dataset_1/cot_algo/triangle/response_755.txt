Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 0 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 1
Node 3 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 6
Node 2 has degree 7

Now, we will relabel the nodes as follows:
Node 8 -> A
Node 0 -> B
Node 6 -> C
Node 3 -> D
Node 4 -> E
Node 1 -> F
Node 5 -> G
Node 9 -> H
Node 7 -> I
Node 2 -> J

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through each edge and look for triangles:

Triangles:
<F, J, G>
<F, J, H>
<F, J, I>
<F, G, H>
<F, G, I>
<J, G, I>

Total number of triangles: [6]
