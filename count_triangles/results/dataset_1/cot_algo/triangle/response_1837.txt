Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0 has 1 connection
Vertex 7 has 1 connection
Vertex 6 has 2 connections
Vertex 5 has 2 connections
Vertex 4 has 2 connections
Vertex 9 has 3 connections
Vertex 8 has 3 connections
Vertex 3 has 4 connections
Vertex 1 has 5 connections
Vertex 2 has 5 connections

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Analyzing the edges, we find the following triangles:
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
