Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices with their respective degrees:
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 5
- Vertex 6: degree 1
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 5
- Vertex 9: degree 1

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 4, 6, and 9 (degree 1) will be relabeled as vertices 0, 1, and 2, respectively.
- Vertex 3 and 7 (degree 2) will be relabeled as vertices 3 and 4, respectively.
- Vertex 1 and 2 (degree 3) will be relabeled as vertices 5 and 6, respectively.
- Vertex 0, 2, 5, and 8 (degree 4 and 5) will be relabeled as vertices 7, 8, 9, and 10, respectively.

Now, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:
1. Edge (1, 8): Forms triangle <1, 8, 9>.
2. Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (3, 7): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (5, 9): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (0, 1): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (7, 5): Forms triangle <4, 7, 9>.
7. Edge (2, 8): Forms triangle <6, 8, 10>.
8. Edge (5, 0): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (3, 5): Forms triangle <4, 5, 7>.
10. Edge (0, 2): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (7, 3): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (0, 8): Forms triangle <7, 8, 9>.
13. Edge (0, 5): Forms triangle <7, 8, 9>.
14. Edge (5, 7): Forms triangle <4, 7, 9>.
15. Edge (8, 6): Forms triangle <7, 8, 10>.
16. Edge (2, 4): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (2, 1): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (8, 5): Forms triangle <7, 8, 9>.

Now, we count the total number of triangles: [5].

The unique triangles found are: 
- <1, 8, 9>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <6, 8, 10>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <7, 8, 9>
