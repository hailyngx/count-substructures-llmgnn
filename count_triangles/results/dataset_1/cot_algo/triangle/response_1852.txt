Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

0: 1 connection
4: 1 connection
7: 1 connection
5: 3 connections
9: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
2: 5 connections
8: 5 connections

Now, we can go through the edges in the sorted order and count the triangles:

(0, 4): No triangles
(1, 3): No triangles
(1, 5): <1, 5, 6>
(1, 6): <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 2>
(2, 6): <1, 6, 2>
(2, 7): No triangles
(2, 8): No triangles
(3, 1): No triangles
(3, 8): No triangles
(3, 9): <1, 3, 9>
(4, 0): No triangles
(5, 1): <1, 5, 6>
(5, 6): <1, 5, 6>
(5, 9): <1, 5, 9>
(6, 1): <1, 5, 6>
(6, 2): <1, 6, 2>, <1, 5, 6>
(6, 5): <1, 5, 6>
(7, 2): No triangles
(8, 2): No triangles
(8, 3): No triangles
(8, 9): <1, 3, 9>
(9, 3): <1, 3, 9>
(9, 5): <1, 5, 9>
(9, 8): <1, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [11] and the unique triangles found are <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 9>.
