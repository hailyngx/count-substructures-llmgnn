Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph with vertices sorted by their degrees is as follows:
Vertices: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 3, 1, 6

The corresponding edges based on the new ordering are:
(0, 9) (2, 5) (4, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) (5, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (3, 1) (5, 2)

By following the degree-based ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

Triangles:
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<9, 8, 5>

Total number of triangles: [4]
