Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we will sort the nodes based on the number of connections:

Nodes in ascending order of connections:
(5) - 0 connections
(4) - 0 connections
(9) - 1 connection
(7) - 2 connections
(6) - 2 connections
(0) - 4 connections
(2) - 4 connections
(1) - 5 connections
(3) - 6 connections
(8) - 6 connections

Now, we will begin counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 2): Check for shared connections between 0 and 2. No triangles.
2. Edge (0, 3): Check for shared connections between 0 and 3. Triangle found: <0, 3, 2>.
3. Edge (0, 4): Check for shared connections between 0 and 4. No triangles.
4. Edge (0, 6): Check for shared connections between 0 and 6. No triangles.
5. Edge (1, 3): Check for shared connections between 1 and 3. Triangle found: <1, 3, 0>.
6. Edge (1, 6): Check for shared connections between 1 and 6. No triangles.
7. Edge (1, 7): Check for shared connections between 1 and 7. No triangles.
8. Edge (1, 8): Check for shared connections between 1 and 8. Triangle found: <1, 8, 3>.
9. Edge (1, 9): Check for shared connections between 1 and 9. No triangles.
10. Edge (2, 0): Skipped as 2 has more connections than 0.
11. Edge (2, 3): Check for shared connections between 2 and 3. Triangle found: <2, 3, 0>.
12. Edge (2, 7): Check for shared connections between 2 and 7. Triangle found: <2, 7, 1>.
13. Edge (3, 0): Skipped as 3 has more connections than 0.
14. Edge (3, 1): Skipped as 3 has more connections than 1.
15. Edge (3, 2): Skipped as 3 has more connections than 2.
16. Edge (3, 8): Check for shared connections between 3 and 8. Triangle found: <3, 8, 1>.
17. Edge (3, 9): Check for shared connections between 3 and 9. No triangles.
18. Edge (4, 0): Skipped as 4 has more connections than 0.
19. Edge (4, 8): Check for shared connections between 4 and 8. No triangles.
20. Edge (5, 8): Check for shared connections between 5 and 8. No triangles.
21. Edge (6, 0): Skipped as 6 has more connections than 0.
22. Edge (6, 1): Skipped as 6 has more connections than 1.
23. Edge (7, 1): Skipped as 7 has more connections than 1.
24. Edge (7, 2): Check for shared connections between 7 and 2. Triangle found: <7, 2, 0>.
25. Edge (8, 1): Skipped as 8 has more connections than 1.
26. Edge (8, 3): Skipped as 8 has more connections than 3.
27. Edge (8, 4): Check for shared connections between 8 and 4. No triangles.
28. Edge (8, 5): Check for shared connections between 8 and 5. No triangles.
29. Edge (9, 1): Skipped as 9 has more connections than 1.
30. Edge (9, 3): Skipped as 9 has more connections than 3.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 0>, <1, 8, 3>, <2, 7, 1>
