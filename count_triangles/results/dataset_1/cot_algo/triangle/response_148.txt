Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
- Vertex 5: 1 connection 
- Vertex 7: 1 connection 
- Vertex 0: 2 connections 
- Vertex 8: 2 connections 
- Vertex 4: 3 connections 
- Vertex 9: 3 connections 
- Vertex 1: 4 connections 
- Vertex 3: 4 connections 
- Vertex 6: 5 connections 
- Vertex 2: 6 connections 

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles in the graph:

Triangles found: 
- <0, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
