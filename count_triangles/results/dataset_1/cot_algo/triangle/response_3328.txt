Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree in ascending order are: 1, 9, 0, 6, 5, 1, 8, 7, 3, 2.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:
- Checking edge (0, 2): Vertex 0 has 4 connections, and vertex 2 has 6 connections. Since vertex 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    - Shared connections between vertices 0 and 2 form triangles with vertices 4, 5, 8.
- Checking edge (0, 4):
    - Shared connection between vertices 0 and 4 forms a triangle with vertex 5.
- Checking edge (0, 5):
    - Shared connections between vertices 0 and 5 form triangles with vertices 3, 4, 6.
- Checking edge (0, 8):
    - Shared connection between vertices 0 and 8 forms a triangle with vertex 2.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 6>.
