Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following order: 4, 1, 6, 9, 8, 7, 3, 5, 2, 0.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 2):
   - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 4, 5, 6.
   - Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 3, 5, 8, 9.
   - Shared connections between 0 and 2: 5.
   - Triangles: <0, 2, 5>.

2. Edge (0, 4):
   - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 2, 5, 6.
   - Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 1, 5.
   - Shared connections between 0 and 4: 5.
   - Triangles: <0, 4, 5>.

3. Edge (0, 5):
   - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 2, 4, 6.
   - Vertex 5 has connections with vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8.
   - Shared connections between 0 and 5: 2, 4.
   - Triangles: <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 4>.

4. Edge (0, 6):
   - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 2, 4, 5.
   - Vertex 6 has connections with vertices 1, 7.
   - No shared connections between 0 and 6.

5. Edge (1, 4):
   - Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 5, 6.
   - Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 0, 5.
   - Shared connections between 1 and 4: 5.
   - Triangles: <1, 4, 5>.

6. Edge (1, 5):
   - Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 4, 6.
   - Vertex 5 has connections with vertices 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8.
   - Shared connections between 1 and 5: 4.
   - Triangles: <1, 5, 4>.

7. Edge (1, 6):
   - Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 5.
   - Vertex 6 has connections with vertices 0, 7.
   - No shared connections between 1 and 6.

8. Edge (2, 0):
   - Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 3, 5, 8, 9.
   - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 4, 5, 6.
   - Shared connections between 2 and 0: 5.
   - Triangles: <2, 0, 5>.

9. Edge (2, 3):
   - Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 0, 5, 8, 9.
   - Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 5, 7, 8.
   - Shared connections between 2 and 3: 5, 8.
   - Triangles: <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>.

10. ... (continue counting the triangles in a similar manner)

After counting all triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
