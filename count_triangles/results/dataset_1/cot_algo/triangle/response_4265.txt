Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most.

The degree of each vertex is as follows:
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 4 connections

Based on the degrees, the vertices can be relabeled as follows:
Vertex 5 --> 0
Vertex 1 --> 1
Vertex 3 --> 2
Vertex 8 --> 3
Vertex 7 --> 4
Vertex 0 --> 5
Vertex 4 --> 6
Vertex 2 --> 7
Vertex 6 --> 8
Vertex 9 --> 9

Now, we consider the edges in order to count the triangles.

(5, 0) - No triangles
(1, 0) - No triangles
(2, 0) - No triangles
(4, 0) - Forms a triangle: <4, 0, 6>
(9, 0) - No triangles
(1, 4) - No triangles
(2, 4) - No triangles
(7, 4) - Forms a triangle: <7, 4, 2>
(0, 6) - Forms a triangle: <0, 6, 4>
(9, 6) - No triangles
(3, 6) - No triangles
(9, 2) - No triangles
(0, 2) - No triangles
(7, 2) - No triangles
(3, 7) - No triangles
(6, 7) - No triangles
(5, 7) - No triangles
(2, 9) - No triangles
(6, 9) - No triangles
(0, 9) - No triangles

The total number of triangles is [3], and the unique triangles found are <4, 0, 6>, <7, 4, 2>, <0, 6, 4>.
