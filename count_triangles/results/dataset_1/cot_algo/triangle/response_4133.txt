Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Node 3 has degree 1
Nodes 6 and 8 have degree 2
Nodes 5 and 9 have degree 3
Nodes 1 and 4 have degree 4
Nodes 0 and 7 have degree 5
Node 2 has degree 6

With this new labeling, we can count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. The total number of triangles is [4].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, and <1, 2, 4>.
