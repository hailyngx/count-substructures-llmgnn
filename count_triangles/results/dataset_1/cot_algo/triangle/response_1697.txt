Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for each vertex are as follows: 

Node 6 - 1 connection
Node 1 - 1 connection
Node 5 - 1 connection
Node 4 - 2 connections
Node 0 - 3 connections
Node 5 - 3 connections
Node 3 - 4 connections
Node 7 - 5 connections
Node 2 - 6 connections
Node 9 - 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles formed in the graph.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.
