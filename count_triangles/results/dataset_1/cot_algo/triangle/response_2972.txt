Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  

Vertex 8 has degree 1  
Vertex 9 has degree 1  
Vertex 5 has degree 2  
Vertex 6 has degree 2  
Vertex 2 has degree 3  
Vertex 1 has degree 3  
Vertex 4 has degree 4  
Vertex 7 has degree 4  
Vertex 0 has degree 5  
Vertex 3 has degree 6  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:  
<0, 3, 7>  
<0, 3, 2>  
<0, 7, 2>  
<1, 4, 6>  
<4, 5, 1>  
<4, 6, 1>  
<4, 7, 6>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
