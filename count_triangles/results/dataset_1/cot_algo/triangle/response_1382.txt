Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices can be relabelled as follows based on their number of connections (degree):

Vertex 3 - 1 connection
Vertex 1 - 2 connections
Vertex 7 - 3 connections
Vertex 5 - 3 connections
Vertex 8 - 3 connections
Vertex 0 - 3 connections
Vertex 2 - 4 connections
Vertex 6 - 5 connections
Vertex 9 - 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges in the graph:

Triangle 1: <0, 2, 6>
Triangle 2: <0, 2, 7>
Triangle 3: <0, 6, 9>
Triangle 4: <1, 2, 5>
Triangle 5: <1, 2, 9>
Triangle 6: <2, 5, 6>
Triangle 7: <2, 6, 9>
Triangle 8: <3, 8, 9>
Triangle 9: <5, 6, 7>
Triangle 10: <6, 7, 8>
Triangle 11: <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [11]
