Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be:
- Node 2 with 2 connections
- Node 5 with 2 connections
- Node 1 with 3 connections
- Node 8 with 3 connections
- Node 3 with 3 connections
- Node 0 with 5 connections
- Node 7 with 5 connections
- Node 4 with 5 connections
- Node 9 with 5 connections
- Node 6 with 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges in the following order: (2, 8), (2, 6), (5, 3), (1, 2), (1, 7), (3, 4), (3, 9), (8, 7), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 4), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7).

After examining all edges, we find that there are a total of [24] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 0>
<4, 6, 2>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 7>
