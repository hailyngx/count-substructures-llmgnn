Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes and their corresponding degrees:

Node 0: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2

Now, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 0 → Node 1
Node 1 → Node 7
Node 2 → Node 2
Node 3 → Node 4
Node 4 → Node 4
Node 5 → Node 2
Node 6 → Node 4
Node 7 → Node 6
Node 8 → Node 2
Node 9 → Node 2

Next, we check the edges based on our relabeling:

(1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7)

Now we count the triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <3, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
