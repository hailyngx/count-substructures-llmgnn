Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <1, 5, 7>
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <1, 7, 2>
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 2 connections
- Edge (2, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <2, 6, 3>
- Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 2 connections
- Edge (3, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <3, 5, 6>
- Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 3 connections
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 4 connections
- Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 2 connections
- Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 3 connections
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 4 connections
- Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 2 connections
- Edge (5, 3) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 6 connections
- Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 3 connections
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 4 connections
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 3 connections
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 6 connections
- Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 5 connections
- Edge (7, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <7, 1, 2>
- Edge (7, 2) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 3 connections
- Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 6 connections
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 3 connections
- Edge (8, 5) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 5 connections
- Edge (9, 3) does not form a triangle as both vertices have 6 connections

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] which are <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 2>, and <3, 5, 6>.
