Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree, from least to most connected. Let's label the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 1
Vertex 8: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 2

Next, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed. Proceeding only when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 2): Vertex 0 and Vertex 2 share a connection with Vertex 3, forming a triangle <0, 2, 3>.
2. Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 and Vertex 3 share connections with Vertex 2 and Vertex 7, forming two triangles <0, 3, 2> and <0, 3, 7>.
3. Edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 and Vertex 7 do not form a triangle since Vertex 0 has more connections.
4. Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 and Vertex 3 share a connection with Vertex 9, forming a triangle <1, 3, 9>.
5. Edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 and Vertex 9 do not form a triangle since Vertex 1 has more connections.
6. Edge (2, 8): Vertex 2 and Vertex 8 share connections with Vertex 0 and Vertex 3, forming two triangles <2, 8, 0> and <2, 8, 3>.
7. Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 and Vertex 4 do not form a triangle since Vertex 3 has more connections.
8. Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 and Vertex 8 share connections with Vertex 2 and Vertex 9, forming two triangles <3, 8, 2> and <3, 8, 9>.
9. Edge (4, 9): Vertex 4 and Vertex 9 share a connection with Vertex 3, forming a triangle <4, 9, 3>.
10. Edge (8, 9): Vertex 8 and Vertex 9 share connections with Vertex 2 and Vertex 3, forming two triangles <8, 9, 2> and <8, 9, 3>.

Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 8, 0>, <2, 8, 3>, <3, 8, 2>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 9, 3>
