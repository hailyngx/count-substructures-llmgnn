Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are: 3, 1, 8, 4, 6, 5, 9, 7, 0, 2.

Now, we will check each edge based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 2): Both vertices have more than 3 connections, so we skip this edge.
2. Edge (0, 7): Both vertices have more than 3 connections, so we skip this edge.
3. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has 3 connections and is less than vertex 9 that has 4 connections. Checking shared connections, we find a triangle: <0, 2, 9>.
4. Edge (1, 4): Both vertices have fewer than 3 connections, so we skip this edge.
5. Edge (1, 8): Both vertices have fewer than 3 connections, so we skip this edge.
6. Edge (2, 0): This edge was already considered.
7. Edge (2, 5): Vertex 2 has 5 connections while vertex 5 has 3 connections. Checking shared connections, we find a triangle: <2, 5, 7>.
8. Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 has 5 connections while vertex 6 has 3 connections. Checking shared connections, we find a triangle: <2, 6, 9>.
9. Edge (2, 7): This edge was already considered.
10. Edge (2, 9): This edge was already considered.
11. Edge (4, 1): This edge was already considered.
12. Edge (5, 2): This edge was already considered.
13. Edge (5, 7): This edge was already considered.
14. Edge (6, 2): This edge was already considered.
15. Edge (6, 9): This edge was already considered.
16. Edge (7, 0): This edge was already considered.
17. Edge (7, 2): This edge was already considered.
18. Edge (7, 5): This edge was already considered.
19. Edge (8, 1): This edge was already considered.
20. Edge (9, 0): This edge was already considered.
21. Edge (9, 2): This edge was already considered.
22. Edge (9, 6): This edge was already considered.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9> and <2, 5, 7>.
