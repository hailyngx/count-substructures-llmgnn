Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Nodes sorted by degree: 2, 0, 2, 1, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5

Since there are no nodes with degree 0, we reduce the lowest degree by 1 for convenience: 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4

Edges process:
Edge (0, 1): 0 has degree 4 and 1 has degree 4. Both have 3 common neighbors: 5, 7, 9
Edge (0, 5): 0 has degree 4 and 5 has degree 4. Both have 2 common neighbors: 1, 4
Edge (0, 7): 0 has degree 4 and 7 has degree 3. Both have 1 common neighbor: 4
Edge (1, 5): 1 has degree 4 and 5 has degree 4. Both have 2 common neighbors: 0, 4
Edge (1, 9): 1 has degree 4 and 9 has degree 3. Both have 1 common neighbor: 0
Edge (3, 6): 3 has degree 3 and 6 has degree 3. Both have 1 common neighbor: 4
Edge (3, 8): 3 has degree 3 and 8 has degree 3. Both have 1 common neighbor: 4
Edge (3, 9): 3 has degree 3 and 9 has degree 3. Both have 1 common neighbor: 1
Edge (4, 5): 4 has degree 3 and 5 has degree 4. Both have 2 common neighbors: 0, 6
Edge (4, 6): 4 has degree 3 and 6 has degree 3. Both have 1 common neighbor: 3
Edge (4, 7): 4 has degree 3 and 7 has degree 3. Both have 1 common neighbor: 0
Edge (4, 8): 4 has degree 3 and 8 has degree 3. Both have 1 common neighbor: 3
Edge (5, 0): 5 has degree 4 and 0 has degree 4. Both have 2 common neighbors: 1, 4
