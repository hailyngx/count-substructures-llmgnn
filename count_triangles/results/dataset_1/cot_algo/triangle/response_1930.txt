Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

0: 2 connections
1: 0 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 3 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes:
Node 1 (0 connections): Node 1 (unchanged)
Nodes 0, 2, 4, 6 (2 connections): Nodes 2, 3, 5, 7
Nodes 9 (3 connections): Node 4
Nodes 8 (4 connections): Node 5
Nodes 3, 5, 7 (4 connections): Nodes 6, 7, 8

Now, we will count the triangles based on the connections between the nodes:
- (2, 8) shares connections with (3, 7) forming the triangle <2, 8, 5>
- (3, 8) shares connections with (6, 7) forming the triangle <3, 8, 7>

Total number of triangles: [2]
