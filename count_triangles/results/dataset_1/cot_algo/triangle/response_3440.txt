Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Count the degree of each node:
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 1
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 0
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 1
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 2

2. Sort nodes based on degrees:
Nodes in ascending order of degree: 4, 1, 6, 2, 3, 5, 9, 7, 0, 8

3. Relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 0 with degree 4 -> Node 6
Node 1 with degree 1 -> Node 1
Node 2 with degree 2 -> Node 5
Node 3 with degree 2 -> Node 7
Node 4 with degree 0 -> Node 2
Node 5 with degree 2 -> Node 3
Node 6 with degree 1 -> Node 8
Node 7 with degree 2 -> Node 4
Node 8 with degree 4 -> Node 0
Node 9 with degree 2 -> Node 9

4. Process the edges:
Edges in correct order based on node labels: 
(6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 6) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (9, 5)

5. Count triangles:
Triangles found:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 6, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
