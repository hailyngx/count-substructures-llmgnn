Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph with 10 nodes is as follows:
Node 2: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 6
Node 0: Degree 7

Using the degree-based ordering, we will now count the triangles:
- Looking at edge (0, 1): Node 0 has degree 7 which is greater than the degree of node 1, so we proceed. Nodes 0 and 1 share a connection with node 7 forming a triangle. Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
- Looking at edge (0, 2): Node 0 has degree 7 which is greater than the degree of node 2, so we proceed. However, no triangle is formed.
- Looking at edge (0, 5): Node 0 has degree 7 which is greater than the degree of node 5, so we proceed. Nodes 0 and 5 share connections with nodes 3 and 6 forming triangles. Triangles: <0, 3, 5> and <0, 5, 6>
- Looking at edge (0, 7): Node 0 has degree 7 which is greater than the degree of node 7, so we proceed. However, no triangle is formed.
- Looking at edge (1, 3): Node 1 has degree 3 which is less than the degree of node 3, so we proceed. Nodes 1 and 3 share a connection with node 7 forming a triangle. Triangle: <1, 3, 7>
- (1, 7) and (3, 1) don't form new triangles as they were already counted above.
- (3, 4) and (9, 3) don't form new triangles.
- Looking at edge (3, 5): Node 3 has degree 5 which is less than the degree of node 5, so we proceed. Nodes 3 and 5 share a connection with nodes 4 and 6 forming triangles. Triangles: <3, 4, 5> and <3, 5, 6>
- Looking at edge (3, 6): Node 3 has degree 5 which is less than the degree of node 6, so we proceed. Node 3 shares a connection with nodes 5 and 9 forming a triangle. Triangle: <3, 5, 9>
- (3, 8) doesn't form new triangles.
- (4, 5) and (6, 5) don't form new triangles.
- Looking at edge (6, 8): Node 6 has degree 4 which is less than the degree of node 8, so we proceed. Node 6 shares connections with nodes 3 and 9 forming a triangle. Triangle: <6, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
