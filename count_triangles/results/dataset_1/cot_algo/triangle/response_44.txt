Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 8, 3, 6, 0, 1, 7, 3, 5, 2, 9

Now, relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 -> 0 (degree 1)
1 -> 1 (degree 3)
2 -> 2 (degree 3)
3 -> 3 (degree 1)
4 -> 4 (degree 6)
5 -> 5 (degree 4)
6 -> 6 (degree 1)
7 -> 7 (degree 2)
8 -> 8 (degree 1)
9 -> 9 (degree 5)

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangle count: 9

[9]

Unique triangles found:
<4, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 9, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 6, 5>
<5, 7, 9>
