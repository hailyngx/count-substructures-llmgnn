Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. In this case, the sorted vertex list is: 

Vertices: 1, 9, 0, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 3, 7

Using this ordering, we can count the triangles in the graph:

1. Vertex 1 (degree 0) - No triangles
2. Vertex 9 (degree 0) - No triangles
3. Vertex 0 (degree 2)
   - No triangles (Vertex 6 and Vertex 7 do not share a connection)
4. Vertex 2 (degree 2)
   - No triangles (Vertex 7 and another vertex do not share a connection)
5. Vertex 5 (degree 2)
   - No triangles (Vertex 4 and Vertex 8 do not share a connection)
6. Vertex 8 (degree 2)
   - No triangles (Vertex 5 and Vertex 7 do not share a connection)
7. Vertex 4 (degree 4)
   - Triangle: <3, 4, 5>
8. Vertex 6 (degree 4)
   - Triangle: <0, 6, 9>
9. Vertex 3 (degree 5)
   - Triangles: <3, 4, 7>
10. Vertex 7 (degree 6)
   - Triangles: <3, 7, 4> and <3, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles found are: <3, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, and <3, 6, 7>.
