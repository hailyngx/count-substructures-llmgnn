Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we obtain the new labels for the vertices as follows:  

- Vertex 3 has degree 2
- Vertex 7 has degree 2
- Vertex 9 has degree 2
- Vertex 0 has degree 3
- Vertex 5 has degree 3
- Vertex 6 has degree 3
- Vertex 1 has degree 4
- Vertex 4 has degree 4
- Vertex 8 has degree 5
- Vertex 2 has degree 5

Based on these labels, we consider the edges in the following order:

1. Edge (0, 3): Forms triangle <0, 3, 4>
2. Edge (0, 5): Forms triangle <0, 5, 7>
3. Edge (0, 8): Forms triangle <0, 8, 1> and <0, 8, 2>
4. Edge (1, 2): Forms triangle <1, 2, 4> and <1, 2, 8>
5. Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed
6. Edge (1, 8): Forms triangle <1, 8, 2> (already counted) and <1, 8, 4>
7. Edge (1, 9): No triangle formed
8. Edge (2, 1): Forms triangle <2, 1, 4> (already counted) and <2, 1, 8> (already counted)
9. Edge (2, 4): Forms triangle <2, 4, 6> and <2, 4, 8>
10. Edge (2, 6): Forms triangle <2, 6, 4>
11. Edge (2, 8): Forms triangle <2, 8, 4> (already counted)
12. Edge (3, 0): Forms triangle <3, 0, 5>
13. Edge (3, 4): Forms triangle <3, 4, 6>
14. Edge (4, 2): Forms triangle <4, 2, 6> (already counted)
15. Edge (4, 3): Forms triangle <4, 3, 6>
16. Edge (4, 6): No triangle formed
17. Edge (4, 8): Forms triangle <4, 8, 0>
18. Edge (5, 0): Forms triangle <5, 0, 7>
19. Edge (5, 7): Forms triangle <5, 7, 1>
20. Edge (5, 9): No triangle formed
21. Edge (6, 2): Forms triangle <6, 2, 4> (already counted)
22. Edge (6, 4): Forms triangle <6, 4, 8>
23. Edge (7, 1): Forms triangle <7, 1, 5>
24. Edge (7, 5): Forms triangle <7, 5, 1>
25. Edge (8, 0): Forms triangle <8, 0, 1>
26. Edge (8, 1): Forms triangle <8, 1, 3>
27. Edge (8, 2): Forms triangle <8, 2, 4> (already counted) and <8, 2, 6>
28. Edge (8, 4): Forms triangle <8, 4, 6> (already counted)
29. Edge (9, 1): No triangle formed
30. Edge (9, 5): No triangle formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [21].
