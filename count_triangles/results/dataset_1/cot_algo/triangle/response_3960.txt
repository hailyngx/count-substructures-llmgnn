Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new order is: 1(6), 0(3), 5(3), 9(3), 7(4), 8(4), 4(5), 2(6), 3(6), 6(6).

The triangles found in this graph are: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<7, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
