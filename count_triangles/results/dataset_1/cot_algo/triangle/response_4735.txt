Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 6, 7: 2 connections
Node 0, 4, 9: 3 connections
Node 1, 5: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
