Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Then we can start counting the triangles.

Based on the given graph, the vertices sorted by their degrees are:
0(2), 1(1), 4(2), 8(2), 5(3), 6(3), 9(2), 2(5), 7(4), 3(6)

Now, we will go through each edge to count the triangles:
1. (0, 5): Both 0 and 5 have 2 connections. No triangle.
2. (0, 7): Both 0 and 7 have 2 connections. No triangle.
3. (1, 5): 1 has 1 connection, 5 has 3 connections, and they share connection 5. Triangle <1, 5, 3>.
4. (2, 4): 4 has 2 connections, 2 has 5 connections, and they share connection 2. Triangle <2, 4, 8>.
5. (2, 6): 6 has 3 connections, 2 has 5 connections, and they share connections 6 and 2. Triangles <2, 4, 8> and <2, 6, 9>.
6. (2, 7): 7 has 4 connections, 2 has 5 connections, and they share connections 7 and 2. Triangle <2, 7, 3>.
7. (3, 5): 3 has 6 connections, 5 has 3 connections, and they share connection 5. Triangle <1, 5, 3>.
8. (3, 6): 3 has 6 connections, 6 has 3 connections, and they share connections 3 and 6. Triangle <2, 6, 9>.
9. (3, 7): 3 has 6 connections, 7 has 4 connections, and they share connections 3 and 7. Triangle <2, 7, 3>.
10. (3, 8): 3 has 6 connections, 8 has 2 connections, and they do not share any connections. No triangle.
11. (3, 9): 3 has 6 connections, 9 has 2 connections, and they share connection 3. Triangle <2, 6, 9>.
12. (4, 2): Already counted in step 4.
13. (4, 8): 4 has 2 connections, 8 has 2 connections, and they share connection 4. Triangle <2, 4, 8>.
14. (5, 0): Already counted in step 1.
15. (5, 1): Already counted in step 3.
16. (5, 3): Already counted in steps 3 and 7.
17. (6, 2): Already counted in step 5.
18. (6, 3): Already counted in steps 6, 8, and 11.
19. (6, 9): Already counted in step 5.
20. (7, 0): Already counted in step 2.
21. (7, 2): Already counted in step 6.
22. (7, 3): Already counted in steps 6 and 9.
23. (8, 3): Already counted in step 9.
24. (8, 4): Already counted in step 13.
25. (9, 3): Already counted in step 11.
26. (9, 6): Already counted in step 11.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4], and the unique triangles found are <1, 5, 3>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, and <2, 7, 3>.
