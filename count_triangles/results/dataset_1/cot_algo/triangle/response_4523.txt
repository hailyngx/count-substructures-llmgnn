Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degree in ascending order, we get: 
Node 0 -> Degree 2
Node 1 -> Degree 2
Node 3 -> Degree 2
Node 4 -> Degree 1
Node 5 -> Degree 2
Node 7 -> Degree 2
Node 9 -> Degree 1
Node 8 -> Degree 4
Node 6 -> Degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges starting from the one with the vertex having the lower label (in case of a tie, choose the lower label vertex):

<0, 1>
Shared connections with node 1: None

<0, 6>
Shared connections with node 6: 5

<1, 8>
Shared connections with node 8: None

<3, 5>
Shared connections with node 5: 6

<3, 6>
Shared connections with node 6: 0

<4, 8>
Shared connections with node 8: 1

<5, 6>
Shared connections with node 6: 0

<6, 7>
Shared connections with node 7: None

<6, 8>
Shared connections with node 8: 1

<7, 9>
Shared connections with node 9: None

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 6>
