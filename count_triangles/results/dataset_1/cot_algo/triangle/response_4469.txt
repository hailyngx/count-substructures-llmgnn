Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees, the new list of edges will be as follows:
(0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) 
(1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) 
(2, 0) (2, 4) 
(3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) 
(4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) 
(5, 0) (5, 4) 
(6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) 
(7, 0) 
(8, 2) 
(9, 2)

Based on the new list of edges, we can find the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 3> 
2. <0, 1, 6> 
3. <0, 4, 2> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
