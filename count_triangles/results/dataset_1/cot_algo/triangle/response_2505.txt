Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 9 (Degree 1)
Node 4 (Degree 2)
Node 8 (Degree 2)
Node 3 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 3)
Node 7 (Degree 3)
Node 5 (Degree 4)
Node 2 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 6)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 4 -> Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (0, 5): Shared connections with 4 & 9 -> Triangles <0, 5, 4> and <0, 5, 9>
- Edge (0, 6): Shared connections with 1, 3, 5 -> Triangles <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 3>, and <0, 6, 5>
- Edge (0, 8): Shared connection with 7 -> Triangle <0, 8, 7>
- Edge (1, 2): Shared connections with 0 -> Triangle <1, 2, 0>
- Edge (1, 3): Shared connection with 6 -> Triangle <1, 3, 6>
- Edge (1, 6): Shared connections with 0 & 5 -> Triangles <1, 6, 0> and <1, 6, 5>
- Edge (3, 7): Shared connections with 4 -> Triangle <3, 7, 4>
- Edge (4, 5): Shared connection with 0 -> Triangle <4, 5, 0>
- Edge (4, 7): Shared connection with 3 -> Triangle <4, 7, 3>
- Edge (5, 9): Shared connection with 0 -> Triangle <5, 9, 0>

Total number of triangles: [11]
