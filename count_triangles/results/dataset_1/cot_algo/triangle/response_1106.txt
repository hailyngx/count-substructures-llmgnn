Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 4: Degree 1
Vertex 1: Degree 1
Vertex 5: Degree 1
Vertex 6: Degree 1
Vertex 9: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 7: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 0: Degree 7

Now, we'll relabel the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 4 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 1 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 5 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 6 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 9 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 8 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 3 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 7 (Degree 5) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 2 (Degree 5) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 0 (Degree 7) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will check for triangles:

Triangles: [27]
