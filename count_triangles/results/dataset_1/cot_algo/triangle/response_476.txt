Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each vertex has:
- Vertex 0 has 2 connections
- Vertex 1 has 5 connections
- Vertex 2 has 3 connections
- Vertex 3 has 4 connections
- Vertex 4 has 4 connections
- Vertex 5 has 2 connections
- Vertex 6 has 1 connection
- Vertex 7 has 2 connections
- Vertex 8 has 5 connections
- Vertex 9 has 1 connection

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on the number of connections in ascending order:
- Vertex 6 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 9 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 0 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 7 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 5 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 2 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 8 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 3 (4 connections) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 4 (4 connections) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 1 (5 connections) becomes Vertex 9

Now, we will consider the edges in the new labeling order:

1. (6, 0): No triangles
2. (9, 1): No triangles
3. (2, 0): No triangles
4. (3, 7): No triangles
5. (5, 4): No triangles
6. (5, 8): No triangles
7. (6, 8): No triangles
8. (7, 0): No triangles
9. (6, 3): Forms a triangle <3, 6, 8>
10. (8, 4): No triangles
11. (0, 1): No triangles
12. (0, 7): No triangles
13. (4, 8): Forms a triangle <4, 6, 8>
14. (8, 2): No triangles
15. (7, 1): No triangles
16. (7, 1): No triangles
17. (4, 1): No triangles
18. (8, 5): Forms a triangle <4, 5, 8>
19. (1, 2): No triangles
20. (1, 3): No triangles
21. (1, 4): No triangles
22. (1, 7): No triangles
23. (2, 1): No triangles
24. (2, 3): No triangles
25. (2, 8): No triangles
26. (3, 1): No triangles
27. (3, 2): No triangles
28. (3, 6): No triangles
29. (3, 8): No triangles
30. (4, 5): No triangles
31. (8, 5): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <3, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 8>
