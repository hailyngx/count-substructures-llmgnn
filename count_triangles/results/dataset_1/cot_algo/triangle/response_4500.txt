Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each vertex:

Vertex 0: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 2
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 4

Now, we relabel the vertices based on the number of connections in ascending order:

Vertex 0 (degree 2) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 2 (degree 2) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 7 (degree 2) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 8 (degree 2) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 5 (degree 3) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 1 (degree 4) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 4 (degree 4) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 9 (degree 4) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 3 (degree 4) -> Vertex 8

Based on the new labeling, let's traverse the edges and count the triangles formed:
(0, 1): No triangle
(0, 3): No triangle
(1, 2): No triangle
(1, 4): No triangle
(2, 4): No triangle
(3, 5): No triangle
(3, 9): No triangle
(4, 8): No triangle
(4, 9): Triangle <3, 7, 8>
(5, 7): No triangle
(5, 9): Triangle <4, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
