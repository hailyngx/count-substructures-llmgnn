Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 6

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
- Edge (0, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 3) forms 1 triangle: <0, 2, 3>.
- Edge (0, 8) forms 1 triangle: <0, 3, 8>.
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) forms 1 triangle: <3, 1, 4>.
- Edge (3, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 8) forms 1 triangle: <4, 0, 8>.
- Edge (5, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 8>, <3, 1, 4>
