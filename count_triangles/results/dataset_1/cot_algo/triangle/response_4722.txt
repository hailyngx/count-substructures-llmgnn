Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 1, 8, 5, 9, 7, 6, 0

Now, we relabel the vertices accordingly based on their degrees:

1 → 0 connections
8 → 2 connections
5 → 2 connections
9 → 3 connections
7 → 4 connections
6 → 4 connections
0 → 5 connections

Next, we examine the edges in order:

(1, 6): No triangle
(8, 7): No triangle
(5, 7): No triangle
(9, 8): No triangle
(7, 1): No triangle
(6, 7): No triangle
(7, 5): No triangle
(7, 6): No triangle
(0, 8): No triangle
(9, 6): No triangle
(1, 7): No triangle
(0, 9): No triangle
(0, 6): No triangle
(6, 0): No triangle
(8, 0): No triangle
(7, 8): Form Triangle <7, 8, 0>
(6, 9): No triangle
(5, 0): No triangle
(0, 5): No triangle
(0, 6): No triangle
(6, 0): No triangle

After examining all the edges, we have found 1 triangle which is <7, 8, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
