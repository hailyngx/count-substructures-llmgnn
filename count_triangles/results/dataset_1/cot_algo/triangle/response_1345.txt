Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex will be:
Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes [(1, 2, 3, 7)]
Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes [(0, 7, 9)]
Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes [(0, 4, 5)]
Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes [(0, 4, 5)]
Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes [(2, 3, 8, 9)]
Node 5 is connected to 5 nodes [(2, 3, 6, 7, 8)]
Node 6 is connected to 3 nodes [(5, 8)]
Node 7 is connected to 4 nodes [(0, 1, 5)]
Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes [(4, 5, 6)]
Node 9 is connected to 2 nodes [(1, 4)]

Now, let's count the triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 7, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [9]
