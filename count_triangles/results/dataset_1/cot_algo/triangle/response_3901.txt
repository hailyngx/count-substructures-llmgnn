Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. In this case, the sorted vertices are as follows:
\[ 
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Vertex} & \text{Degree} \\
\hline
4 & 2 \\
0 & 2 \\
1 & 3 \\
7 & 4 \\
5 & 4 \\
8 & 4 \\
6 & 5 \\
3 & 5 \\
9 & 6 \\
2 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on this sorting:
\[ 
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Old Label} & \text{New Label} \\
\hline
0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 \\
7 & 2 \\
5 & 3 \\
8 & 4 \\
6 & 5 \\
3 & 6 \\
9 & 7 \\
2 & 8 \\
4 & 9 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Using this relabeling, the edges become: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 2). 

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph:
- Starting with the edge (0, 7): No triangles.
- Moving to the edge (1, 6): No triangles.
- Continuing with the edge (1, 3): Forms a triangle <1, 3, 6>.
- Proceeding with the edge (1, 7): No triangles.
- Moving to the edge (2, 6): No triangles.
- Continuing with the edge (2, 5): Forms a triangle <2, 5, 6>.
- Proceeding with the edge (2, 3): Forms a triangle <2, 3, 6>.
- Moving to the edge (2, 7): Forms a triangle <2, 7, 5>.
- Continuing with the edge (3, 6): Forms a triangle <3, 6, 2>.
- Proceeding with the edge (3, 8): No triangles.
- Moving to the edge (3, 5): Forms a triangle <3, 5, 6>.
- Continuing with the edge (3, 4): No triangles.
- Proceeding with the edge (4, 5): No triangles.
- Moving to the edge (4, 2): No triangles.
- Continuing with the edge (5, 6): Forms a triangle <5, 6, 2>.
- Proceeding with the edge (5, 2): No triangles.
- Moving to the edge (5, 4): No triangles.
- Continuing with the edge (5, 7): Forms a triangle <5, 7, 2>.
- Proceeding with the edge (6, 2): Forms a triangle <6, 2, 5>.
- Moving to the edge (6, 3): Forms a triangle <6, 3, 2>.
- Continuing with the edge (6, 4): Forms a triangle <6, 4, 5>.
- Proceeding with the edge (6, 8): Forms a triangle <6, 8, 3>.
- Moving to the edge (7, 2): Forms a triangle <7, 2, 5>.
- Continuing with the edge (7, 4): No triangles.
- Proceeding with the edge (7, 5): Forms a triangle <7, 5, 2>.
- Moving to the edge (7, 1): No triangles.
- Continuing with the edge (8, 3): No triangles.
- Proceeding with the edge (8, 5): Forms a triangle <8, 5, 6>.
- Moving to the edge (8, 6): No triangles.
- Continuing with the edge (9, 0): No triangles.
- Proceeding with the edge (9, 1): Forms a triangle <9, 1, 7>.
- Moving to the edge (9, 8): No triangles.
- Continuing with the edge (9, 3): Forms a triangle <9, 3, 1>.
- Proceeding with the edge (9, 2): Forms a triangle <9, 2, 7>.

The total number of triangles found is 12, and the unique triangles are <1, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 7, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 2>, <5, 7, 2>, <6, 2, 5>, <6, 3, 2>, <6, 4, 5>, <6, 8, 3>, <7, 2, 5>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
