Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, we get the following labels: 
Node 7: degree 2
Node 0: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 5: degree 6
Node 8: degree 6
Node 4: degree 7

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check the edges starting with the vertices with lower labels and fewer connections.

By following the method and searching for triangles, we find that there are 10 triangles in the graph: 
[10]

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 1, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
