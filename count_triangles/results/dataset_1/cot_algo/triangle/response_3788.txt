Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
- Node 7: 0 connections
- Node 1, 2, 3, 7, 9: 1 connection
- Node 4, 6: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on the sorting above:
- Node 7 (0 connections) will remain as Node 7
- Nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, 9 (1 connection) will be relabeled as Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Nodes 4, 6 (2 connections) will be relabeled as Node 6, 7
- Node 5 (3 connections) will be relabeled as Node 8
- Node 8 (4 connections) will be relabeled as Node 9

Next, we will list the unique triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (2, 4):
   - Node 2 and Node 4 share a connection with Node 8, forming a triangle <2, 4, 8>.

2. Edge (2, 8):
   - Node 2 and Node 8 share a connection with Node 4, forming a triangle <2, 8, 4>.

3. Edge (3, 8):
   - Node 3 and Node 8 share a connection with Node 4, forming a triangle <3, 8, 4>.

4. Edge (6, 9):
   - Node 6 and Node 9 share a connection with Node 8, forming a triangle <6, 9, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
