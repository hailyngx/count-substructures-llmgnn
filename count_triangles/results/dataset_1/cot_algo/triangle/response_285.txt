Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Starting with the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their degrees as follows: 

Nodes in increasing order of degrees: 
2 (degree 2)
6 (degree 3)
5 (degree 3)
8 (degree 4)
4 (degree 5)
3 (degree 5)
7 (degree 5)
1 (degree 6)
9 (degree 6)
0 (degree 6)

Using this ordering, we relabel the nodes:
2 → 0
6 → 1
5 → 2
8 → 3
4 → 4
3 → 5
7 → 6
1 → 7
9 → 8
0 → 9

Now, we count the triangles by checking the shared connections between vertices of each edge:

Triangles: 
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [10]
