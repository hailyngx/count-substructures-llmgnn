Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
0 - degree 4
1 - degree 5
2 - degree 4
3 - degree 3
4 - degree 6
5 - degree 4
6 - degree 5
7 - degree 4
8 - degree 4
9 - degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges with the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with vertex 3.
- Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with vertices 9 and 7.
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 9.
- Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle as vertex 9 has more connections than 0.

There are 3 unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
