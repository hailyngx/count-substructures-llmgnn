Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
We will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 
0 - degree 4
1 - degree 3
2 - degree 3
3 - degree 4
4 - degree 3
5 - degree 3
6 - degree 3
7 - degree 2
8 - degree 3
9 - degree 5

Reordering the vertices: 
7, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 3, 0, 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
Looking at the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. Edge (1, 2): forms a triangle with vertex 4
2. Edge (1, 4): forms a triangle with vertex 8
3. Edge (1, 7): does not form a triangle

4. Edge (2, 1): forms a triangle with vertex 4
5. Edge (2, 8): forms a triangle with vertex 4
6. Edge (2, 9): does not form a triangle

7. Edge (4, 1): forms a triangle with vertex 8
8. Edge (4, 8): does not form a triangle

9. Edge (5, 0): forms a triangle with vertex 3
10. Edge (5, 3): forms a triangle with vertex 9
11. Edge (5, 9): does not form a triangle

12. Edge (6, 0): does not form a triangle
13. Edge (6, 8): does not form a triangle

14. Edge (8, 2): forms a triangle with vertex 4

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 4>
<3, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
