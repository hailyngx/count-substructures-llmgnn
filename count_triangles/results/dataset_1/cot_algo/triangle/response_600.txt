Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0 - 3 connections 
Node 1 - 3 connections 
Node 7 - 1 connections 
Node 3 - 1 connection 
Node 4 - 2 connections 
Node 6 - 1 connection 
Node 8 - 6 connections 
Node 9 - 6 connections 
Node 2 - 4 connections 
Node 5 - 5 connections 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 2) is not considered since both vertices have the same number of connections.
2. Edge (0, 7) is not considered since vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 7.
3. Edge (0, 8) is considered.
4. Edge (1, 5) is not considered.
5. Edge (1, 8) is considered.
6. Edge (1, 9) is not considered.
7. Edge (2, 0) is considered.
8. Edge (2, 8) is not considered.
9. Edge (2, 9) is not considered.
10. Edge (3, 8) is not considered.
11. Edge (4, 5) is considered.
12. Edge (4, 9) is considered.
13. Edge (5, 1) is not considered.
14. Edge (5, 4) is not considered.
15. Edge (5, 6) is not considered.
16. Edge (5, 9) is considered.
17. Edge (6, 5) is not considered.
18. Edge (7, 0) is not considered.
19. Edge (8, 0) is not considered.
20. Edge (8, 1) is not considered.
21. Edge (8, 2) is not considered.
22. Edge (8, 3) is not considered.
23. Edge (8, 9) is not considered.
24. Edge (9, 1) is not considered.
25. Edge (9, 2) is not considered.
26. Edge (9, 4) is not considered.
27. Edge (9, 5) is not considered.
28. Edge (9, 8) is not considered.

By considering the edges as mentioned above, we find the following triangles: 
<0, 2, 8> 
<4, 5, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
