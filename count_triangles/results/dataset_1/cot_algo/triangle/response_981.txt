Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by connections:
1. Vertex 6: Connected to 1 node
2. Vertex 7: Connected to 2 nodes
3. Vertex 1: Connected to 2 nodes
4. Vertex 9: Connected to 3 nodes
5. Vertex 0: Connected to 4 nodes
6. Vertex 2: Connected to 4 nodes
7. Vertex 5: Connected to 5 nodes
8. Vertex 3: Connected to 5 nodes
9. Vertex 4: Connected to 6 nodes
10. Vertex 8: Connected to 6 nodes

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [12]
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 5, 8>
