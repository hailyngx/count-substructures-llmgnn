Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following labels:
Node 2 - 2 connections
Node 1 - 2 connections
Node 4 - 1 connection
Node 5 - 1 connection
Node 7 - 1 connection
Node 8 - 1 connection
Node 9 - 2 connections
Node 3 - 3 connections
Node 0 - 6 connections
Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will iterate through the edges while ensuring that for each edge, the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
