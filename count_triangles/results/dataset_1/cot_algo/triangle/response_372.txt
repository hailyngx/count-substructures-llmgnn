Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Node 4 has 0 connections  
Node 5 has 0 connections  
Node 7 has 0 connections  
Node 3 has 1 connection  
Node 2 has 2 connections  
Node 8 has 2 connections  
Node 1 has 3 connections  
Node 6 has 4 connections  
Node 0 has 6 connections  
Node 9 has 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph: 

[15]

The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 7>, <8, 9, 0>, <8, 9, 6>, <9, 0, 6>, <9, 0, 3>, <9, 0, 1>.
