Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows: (1) 4, (2) 5, (3) 1, (4) 7, (5) 9, (6) 6, (7) 2, (8) 8, (9) 0, (10) 3.

By following the degree-based ordering method and considering the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections, we can count the total number of triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>.
