Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, the new ordering is as follows:

Vertices: 0 (degree 3), 5 (degree 1), 7 (degree 2), 6 (degree 2), 8 (degree 2), 4 (degree 3), 3 (degree 4), 1 (degree 4), 9 (degree 4), 2 (degree 4)

Now, we will examine each edge based on the degree-based ordering:

1. (0, 1) - Both 0 and 1 have degree 4. They share vertices 2 and 7, forming the triangle <0, 1, 2>.
2. (0, 2) - The degrees of 0 and 2 are 3 and 4 respectively. They share vertices 1 and 7, forming the triangle <0, 2, 1>.
3. (0, 7) - The degrees of 0 and 7 are 3 and 2 respectively. As 0 has fewer connections, we proceed. Vertices 0 and 7 do not share any vertices.
4. (1, 2) - Both 1 and 2 have degree 4. They share vertices 0 and 4, forming the triangle <1, 2, 0>.
5. (1, 4) - The degrees of 1 and 4 are 4 each. They share vertices 0 and 3, forming the triangle <1, 4, 0>.
6. (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 have degree 4. They share vertices 3 and 7, forming the triangle <1, 9, 3>.
7. (2, 0) - The degrees of 2 and 0 are 4 and 3 respectively. As 0 has fewer connections, we proceed. Vertices 2 and 0 do not share any vertices.
8. (2, 1) - Both 2 and 1 have degree 4. They share vertices 0 and 4, forming the triangle <2, 1, 0>.
9. (2, 3) - The degrees of 2 and 3 are 4 each. They share vertices 1 and 6, forming the triangle <2, 3, 1>.
10. (2, 6) - The degrees of 2 and 6 are 4 and 2 respectively. As 6 has fewer connections, we proceed. Vertices 2 and 6 do not share any vertices.
11. (3, 4) - The degrees of 3 and 4 are 4 each. They share vertices 1 and 9, forming the triangle <3, 4, 1>.
12. (3, 8) - The degrees of 3 and 8 are 4 and 2 respectively. As 8 has fewer connections, we proceed. Vertices 3 and 8 do not share any vertices.
13. (3, 9) - The degrees of 3 and 9 are 4 each. They share vertices 1 and 7, forming the triangle <3, 9, 1>.
14. (4, 1) - The degrees of 4 and 1 are 3 and 4 respectively. As 4 has fewer connections, we proceed. Vertices 4 and 1 do not share any vertices.
15. (4, 3) - The degrees of 4 and 3 are 3 and 4 respectively. As 4 has fewer connections, we proceed. Vertices 4 and 3 do not share any vertices.
16. (4, 5) - The degrees of 4 and 5 are 3 each. They share vertices 1 and 3, forming the triangle <4, 5, 1>.
17. (5, 4) - Both 4 and 5 have degree 3. They share vertices 1 and 3, forming the triangle <5, 4, 1>.
18. (6, 2) - The degrees of 6 and 2 are 2 and 4 respectively. As 6 has fewer connections, we proceed. Vertices 6 and 2 do not share any vertices.
19. (6, 8) - The degrees of 6 and 8 are 2 each. They share vertex 3, forming the triangle <6, 8, 3>.
20. (7, 0) - The degrees of 7 and 0 are 2 and 3 respectively. As 7 has fewer connections, we proceed. Vertices 7 and 0 do not share any vertices.
21. (7, 9) - The degrees of 7 and 9 are 2 each. They share vertex 1, forming the triangle <7, 9, 1>.
22. (8, 3) - The degrees of 8 and 3 are 2 and 4 respectively. As 8 has fewer connections, we proceed. Vertices 8 and 3 do not share any vertices.
23. (8, 6) - The degrees of 8 and 6 are 2 each. They share vertex 3, forming the triangle <8, 6, 3>.
24. (9, 1) - The degrees of 9 and 1 are 4 each. They share vertices 3 and 7, forming the triangle <9, 1, 3>.
25. (9, 3) - The degrees of 9 and 3 are 4 each. They share vertices 1 and 7, forming the triangle <9, 3, 1>.
26. (9, 7) - The degrees of 9 and 7 are 4 and 2 respectively. As 7 has fewer connections, we proceed. Vertices 9 and 7 do not share any vertices.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
