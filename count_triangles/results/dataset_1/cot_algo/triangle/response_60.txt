Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, let's re-label the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 1 (degree 2) -> Node 0
- Node 3 (degree 2) -> Node 1
- Node 4 (degree 3) -> Node 2
- Node 5 (degree 3) -> Node 3
- Node 6 (degree 3) -> Node 4
- Node 2 (degree 4) -> Node 5
- Node 7 (degree 4) -> Node 6
- Node 8 (degree 4) -> Node 7
- Node 9 (degree 4) -> Node 8
- Node 0 (degree 5) -> Node 9

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges:
- Edge (1, 0): No triangle
- Edge (3, 1): No triangle
- Edge (4, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (5, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Edge (6, 4): No triangle
- Edge (2, 5): No triangle
- Edge (7, 6): No triangle
- Edge (8, 7): Triangle <0, 7, 8>
- Edge (9, 8): Triangle <0, 8, 9>

There are 3 triangles in total: [3].
