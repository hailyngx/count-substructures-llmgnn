Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most, the new label for each node is: 9, 5, 1, 2, 8, 6, 3, 7, 4, 0.

Now, evaluating each edge with the lower labeled node having fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 3) forms triangles with nodes 2, 7.
- Edge (0, 7) forms triangles with nodes 1, 6, 9.
- Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with node 6.
- Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with node 6.
- Edge (2, 3) forms a triangle with node 4.
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 8, 5.

Counting these unique triangles, we get: 
[6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
