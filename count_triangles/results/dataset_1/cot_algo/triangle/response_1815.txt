Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
Nodes sorted by degree:  
0 - 3 connections  
3 - 2 connections  
2 - 2 connections  
8 - 4 connections  
5 - 4 connections  
9 - 3 connections  
1 - 6 connections  
7 - 6 connections  
6 - 5 connections  
4 - 8 connections  

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:  
Triangles:  
[<0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 0>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 7, 4>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 0, 9>, <7, 0, 3>, <7, 0, 9>, <7, 3, 4>, <7, 4, 5>, <7, 5, 8>, <8, 1, 4>, <8, 1, 5>, <8, 1, 6>, <8, 1, 9>, <8, 4, 9>]  

Total number of triangles:
