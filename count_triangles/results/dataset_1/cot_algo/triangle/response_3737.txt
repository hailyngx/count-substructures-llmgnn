Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (i.e., the number of edges incident to each vertex). Here is the sorted list of vertices with their corresponding degrees:

1. Vertex 0: Degree 3
2. Vertex 4: Degree 1
3. Vertex 5: Degree 1
4. Vertex 9: Degree 1
5. Vertex 3: Degree 2
6. Vertex 6: Degree 2
7. Vertex 7: Degree 2
8. Vertex 1: Degree 4
9. Vertex 8: Degree 4
10. Vertex 2: Degree 5

Now, we will examine each edge in the graph while considering the degree-based ordering. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Counting the triangles by examining the edges:

1. Edge (0, 3):
   - Shared connections with vertex 0: 4, 8
   - Triangle: <0, 3, 4>

2. Edge (0, 4):
   - No triangles can be formed as vertex 4 has the smallest degree among the connected vertices.

3. Edge (0, 8):
   - Shared connections with vertex 0: 3
   - No triangles can be formed as vertex 8 has the smallest degree among the connected vertices.

4. Edge (1, 2):
   - Shared connections with vertex 1: 8
   - Triangle: <1, 2, 8>

5. Edge (1, 5):
   - No triangles can be formed as vertex 5 has the smallest degree among the connected vertices.

6. Edge (1, 8):
   - No triangles can be formed as vertex 8 already shared a triangle with vertex 2.

7. Edge (1, 9):
   - No triangles can be formed as vertex 9 has the smallest degree among the connected vertices.

8. Edge (2, 3):
   - Shared connections with vertex 2: 1, 8
   - Triangle: <2, 3, 1>

9. Edge (2, 6):
   - Shared connections with vertex 2: 7
   - No triangles can be formed as vertex 6 has the smallest degree among the connected vertices.

10. Edge (2, 7):
   - No triangles can be formed as vertex 7 has the smallest degree among the connected vertices.

In this graph, we found a total of [3] triangles. The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 3, 1>
