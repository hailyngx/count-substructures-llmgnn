Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes with their degrees:
0: 3
1: 1
2: 4
3: 4
4: 3
5: 1
6: 1
7: 3
8: 2
9: 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
Node ordering:
1. 1 (Node 1)
2. 5 (Node 5)
3. 6 (Node 6)
4. 8 (Node 8)
5. 9 (Node 9)
6. 0 (Node 0)
7. 4 (Node 4)
8. 7 (Node 7)
9. 2 (Node 2)
10. 3 (Node 3)

Now, we will examine each edge to count the number of triangles:

(0, 2):
Shared connections: 3, 9
Triangle(s): <0, 2, 3>

(0, 3):
Shared connections: 2, 9
Triangle(s): <0, 2, 3>

(0, 9):
Shared connections: 2, 3
Triangle(s): <0, 2, 3>

(1, 4):
No triangles.

(2, 3):
Shared connections: 0, 9
Triangle(s): <0, 2, 3>

(2, 4):
Shared connections: 7
Triangle(s): <2, 3, 7>

(2, 7):
No triangles.

(3, 6):
No triangles.

(3, 9):
Shared connections: 0
Triangle(s): <0, 2, 3>

(4, 7):
No triangles.

(5, 8):
No triangles.

(7, 8):
No triangles.

Count of triangles: [5]
