Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for each vertex will be:
- Node 0 (degree 2)
- Node 5 (degree 1)
- Node 4 (degree 1)
- Node 9 (degree 6) 
- Node 1 (degree 3)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 5)
- Node 7 (degree 4)
- Node 8 (degree 4)
- Node 2 (degree 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

1. (0, 1): Shared connections with 1: [5]
2. (0, 9): Shared connections with 9: [2]
3. (1, 5): Shared connections with 5: []
4. (1, 6): Shared connections with 6: [7, 9]
5. (1, 6): Shared connections with 6: [7, 9]
6. (1, 6): Shared connections with 6: [7, 9]
7. (2, 3): Shared connections with 3: [7, 8, 9]
8. (2, 6): Shared connections with 6: [1, 7, 9]
9. (2, 8): Shared connections with 8: [4, 7]
10. (2, 9): Shared connections with 9: [0, 3, 6]
11. (3, 7): Shared connections with 7: [6, 8]
12. (3, 8): Shared connections with 8: [7]
13. (3, 9): Shared connections with 9: [0, 2, 6]
14. (6, 7): Shared connections with 7: [3, 8]
15. (6, 7): Shared connections with 7: [3, 8]
16. (6, 8): Shared connections with 8: [7]
17. (6, 9): Shared connections with 9: [0, 1, 2, 3]

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles found:
- <1, 6, 9>
- <2, 3, 7>
