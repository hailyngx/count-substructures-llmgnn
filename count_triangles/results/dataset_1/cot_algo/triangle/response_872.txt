Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new numbering of the vertices would be:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles by considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [10].
