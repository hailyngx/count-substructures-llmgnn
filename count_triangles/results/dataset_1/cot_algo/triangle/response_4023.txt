Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new order is: 

0 (degree 2)
4 (degree 0)
8 (degree 1)
3 (degree 2)
7 (degree 1)
5 (degree 3)
6 (degree 4)
2 (degree 3)
1 (degree 5)
9 (degree 4)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
(0, 1): No triangles
(0, 9): No triangles
(1, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 6>
(1, 3): No triangles
(1, 8): No triangles
(2, 6): Triangle <2, 6, 9>
(2, 9): No triangles
(3, 6): Triangle <3, 6, 2>
(5, 6): No triangles
(5, 9): No triangles
(6, 7): No triangles

After counting all triangles, the total number of triangles is [3].
