Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: <2, 3, 7, 1, 5, 0, 8, 6, 4>. 

Now, we will count the triangles by checking shared connections between vertices with lower labels.

We find the following triangles:
<1, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
