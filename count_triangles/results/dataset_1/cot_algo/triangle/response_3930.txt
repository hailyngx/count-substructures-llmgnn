Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by number of connections:
0: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
3: 4 connections
2: 7 connections

Based on the sorting above, we will proceed with counting the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 (degree 2) < Node 1 (degree 3)
   Shared connections between 0 and 1: [2]
   Triangle found: <0, 1, 2>

2. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 (degree 2) < Node 2 (degree 7)
   Shared connections between 0 and 2: [1]
   Triangle found: <0, 1, 2>

3. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 (degree 3) < Node 2 (degree 7)
   Shared connections between 1 and 2: [0]
   Triangle found: <0, 1, 2>

4. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 (degree 7) > Node 4 (degree 3), skip.

5. Edge (2, 5): Node 2 (degree 7) > Node 5 (degree 2), skip.

6. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 (degree 7) > Node 6 (degree 2), skip.

7. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 (degree 7) > Node 7 (degree 2), skip.

8. Edge (3, 1): Node 1 (degree 3) < Node 3 (degree 4)
   Shared connections between 3 and 1: [2]
   Triangle found: <1, 2, 3>

9. Edge (3, 7): Node 3 (degree 4) < Node 7 (degree 2)
   Shared connections between 3 and 7: [2]
   Triangle found: <1, 2, 3>

10. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 (degree 4) < Node 8 (degree 2)
    No triangle formed.

11. Edge (3, 9): Node 3 (degree 4) < Node 9 (degree 2)
    No triangle formed.

12. Edge (4, 6): Node 4 (degree 3) < Node 6 (degree 2)
    No triangle formed.

13. Edge (4, 9): Node 4 (degree 3) < Node 9 (degree 2)
    No triangle formed.

14. Edge (5, 8): Node 5 (degree 2) < Node 8 (degree 2)
    No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 3>
