Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 
0(3) < 1(2) < 7(2) < 9(2) < 6(3) < 8(3) < 5(4) < 2(4) < 4(5) < 3(6)

Now, we will go through each edge based on the degree-based ordering:

1. Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 < Vertex 3
    - Shared connections with Vertex 0: 5, 6
    - Shared connections with Vertex 3: 4, 7
    - Triangle found: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>

2. Edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 < Vertex 5
    - Shared connections with Vertex 0: 3, 6
    - Shared connections with Vertex 5: 1, 2
    - Triangle found: <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 2>

3. Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 < Vertex 6
    - Shared connections with Vertex 0: 3, 5
    - Shared connections with Vertex 6: 4, 8
    - Triangle found: <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 8>

4. Edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 < Vertex 4
    - Shared connections with Vertex 1: 5
    - Shared connections with Vertex 4: 2, 3, 6, 9
    - Triangle found: <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>

5. Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 < Vertex 4
    - Shared connections with Vertex 2: 5
    - Shared connections with Vertex 4: 1, 3, 6, 9
    - Triangle found: <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 9>

6. Edge (2, 5): Vertex 2 < Vertex 5
    - Shared connections with Vertex 2: 4
    - Shared connections with Vertex 5: 0, 1, 8
    - Triangle found: <2, 5, 0>, <2, 5, 1>, <2, 5, 8>

7. Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 < Vertex 7
    - Shared connections with Vertex 2: 4
    - Shared connections with Vertex 7: 3
    - Triangle found: <2, 7, 3>

Total number of triangles: [13]
