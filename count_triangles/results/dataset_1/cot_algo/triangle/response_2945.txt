Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Then, for each edge, we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Let's find the triangles in this graph.

Sorted vertices based on their number of connections:
Vertices: 3, 6, 4, 5, 2, 1, 8, 9, 0, 7

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [12]
