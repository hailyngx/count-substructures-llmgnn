Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
0 (degree 1), 1 (degree 1), 4 (degree 1), 8 (degree 1), 5 (degree 2), 6 (degree 2), 3 (degree 3), 7 (degree 3), 2 (degree 4), 9 (degree 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle <2, 7, 5>
- Triangle <2, 9, 6>
- Triangle <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
