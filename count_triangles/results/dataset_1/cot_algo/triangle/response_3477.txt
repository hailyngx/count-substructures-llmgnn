Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 5 has 0 connections.
Node 1 has 1 connection.
Node 9 has 1 connection.
Node 6 has 2 connections.
Node 0 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.
Node 3 has 6 connections.
Node 7 has 6 connections.
Node 8 has 6 connections.

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following:
Total number of triangles: [13]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
