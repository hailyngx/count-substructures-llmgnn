Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labels for each node would be as follows:
Node 5 - degree 2
Node 6 - degree 1
Node 1 - degree 2
Node 4 - degree 3
Node 2 - degree 3
Node 7 - degree 4
Node 8 - degree 4
Node 0 - degree 7
Node 9 - degree 4
Node 3 - degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
(0, 1) forms the triangle <0, 1, 4>.
(0, 2) does not create a triangle.
(0, 3) forms the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
(0, 5) does not create a triangle.
(0, 8) does not create a triangle.
(0, 9) does not create a triangle.
(1, 4) does not create a triangle.
(2, 3) does not create a triangle.
(3, 6) does not create a triangle.
(3, 7) does not create a triangle.
(3, 8) does not create a triangle.
(3, 9) does not create a triangle.
(4, 7) does not create a triangle.
(4, 9) does not create a triangle.
(5, 7) does not create a triangle.
(6, 3) does not create a triangle.
(7, 5) does not create a triangle.
(8, 5) does not create a triangle.
(9, 4) does not create a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
