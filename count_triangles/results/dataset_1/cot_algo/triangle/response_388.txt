Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 1 connection.
Nodes 4, 6, 9 have 2 connections.
Nodes 5 and 8 have 4 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.

Relabeling the nodes accordingly:

Node 3 (1 connection) becomes Node 0.
Node 7 (1 connection) becomes Node 1.
Nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 9 (2 connections) become Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Nodes 5, 8 (4 connections) become Nodes 7, 8.
Node 2 (5 connections) becomes Node 9.

The graph with relabeled nodes and edges: 
(2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7)

Now, let's count the triangles by checking for shared connections:
- Node 2 (7) shares connections with Node 5 (4) and Node 3 (6).
- Node 2 (7) shares connections with Node 7 (8) and Node 8 (4).

Therefore, the triangles are: <2, 5, 3>, <2, 7, 8>.

So, the total number of triangles is [2].
