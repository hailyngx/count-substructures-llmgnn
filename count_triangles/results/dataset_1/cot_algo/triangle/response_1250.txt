Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new node labels are: 
```
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
```

We will now count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (0, 1): Both nodes have 3 connections. No triangles.
2. Edge (0, 6): Node 0 has 3 connections, Node 6 has 6 connections. No triangles.
3. Edge (1, 2): Both nodes have 6 connections. No triangles.
4. Edge (1, 8): Both nodes have 6 connections. No triangles.
5. Edge (1, 9): Both nodes have 6 connections. No triangles.
6. Edge (2, 3): Both nodes have 4 connections. No triangles.
7. Edge (3, 7): Both nodes have 6 connections. No triangles.
8. Edge (4, 8): Both nodes have 4 connections. No triangles.
9. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 has 6 connections, Node 7 has 6 connections. Triangle found: <6, 7, 9>.
10. Edge (6, 9): Node 6 has 6 connections, Node 9 has 6 connections. Triangle found: <6, 7, 9>.
11. Edge (7, 8): Both nodes have 6 connections. No triangles.
12. Edge (8, 4): Both nodes have 4 connections. No triangles.
13. Edge (9, 1): Node 1 has 6 connections, Node 9 has 6 connections. Triangle found: <6, 7, 9>.
14. Edge (9, 7): Node 7 has 6 connections, Node 9 has 6 connections. Triangle found: <6, 7, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <6, 7, 9>.
