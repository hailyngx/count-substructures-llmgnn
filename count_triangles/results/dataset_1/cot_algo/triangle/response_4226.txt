Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 6
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. (0, 3):
   Shared connections: 4, 8
   Triangle: <0, 3, 4>

2. (0, 4):
   Shared connections: 3, 9
   Triangle: <0, 3, 9>

3. (0, 8):
   Shared connections: 3
   Triangle: <0, 3, 8>

4. (1, 3):
   Shared connections: 7
   Triangle: <1, 3, 7>

5. (1, 7):
   Shared connections: 3
   Triangle: <1, 3, 7>

6: (1, 9):
   Shared connections: 4, 5
   Triangle: <1, 4, 5>

7. (2, 7):
   No triangle formed.

8. (3, 7):
   Shared connections: 1
   Triangle: <1, 3, 7>
   Shared connections: 5
   Triangle: <3, 5, 7>
   Shared connections: 6
   Triangle: <3, 6, 7>

9. (3, 8):
   Shared connections: 0
   Triangle: <0, 3, 8>

10. (4, 9):
   Shared connections: 1
   Triangle: <1, 4, 9>
   Shared connections: 5
   Triangle: <4, 5, 9>
   Shared connections: 8
   Triangle: <0, 4, 8>

11. (5, 7):
   Shared connections: 1
   Triangle: <1, 5, 7>
   Shared connections: 3
   Triangle: <3, 5, 7>
   Shared connections: 9
   Triangle: <5, 7, 9>

12. (9, 8):
   Shared connections: 0
   Triangle: <0, 8, 9>
   Shared connections: 3
   Triangle: <3, 8, 9>
   Shared connections: 4
   Triangle: <4, 8, 9>
   Shared connections: 5
   Triangle: <5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [12]
