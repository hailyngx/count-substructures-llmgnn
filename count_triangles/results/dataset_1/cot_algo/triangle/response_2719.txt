Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method as described earlier.

First, let's calculate the degree (number of connections) of each node:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 7 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 9: 5 connections

Now, we'll relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 8 (Degree 1) - Label as 0
- Node 0 (Degree 2) - Label as 1
- Node 6 (Degree 2) - Label as 2
- Node 7 (Degree 2) - Label as 3
- Node 2 (Degree 3) - Label as 4
- Node 5 (Degree 4) - Label as 5
- Node 1 (Degree 4) - Label as 6
- Node 9 (Degree 5) - Label as 7
- Node 3 (Degree 7) - Label as 8

Now, we will start counting the triangles:

- Looking at the edges involving Node 0 (Label 1), we find no triangles.
- Looking at the edges involving Node 6 (Label 2), we find no triangles.
- Looking at the edges involving Node 7 (Label 3), we find no triangles.
- Looking at the edges involving Node 2 (Label 4), we find the following triangles:
  - Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Looking at the edges involving Node 5 (Label 5), we find the following triangles:
  - Triangle <1, 5, 6>
  - Triangle <3, 5, 6>
- Looking at the edges involving Node 1 (Label 6), we find the following triangles:
  - Triangle <2, 3, 6>
  - Triangle <3, 5, 6>
- Looking at the edges involving Node 9 (Label 7), we find the following triangles:
  - Triangle <2, 3, 6>
  - Triangle <3, 5, 6>
  - Triangle <2, 3, 9>
- Looking at the edges involving Node 3 (Label 8), we find the following triangles:
  - Triangle <1, 3, 5>
  - Triangle <1, 3, 6>
  - Triangle <1, 5, 6>
  - Triangle <2, 3, 6>
  - Triangle <5, 7, 9>

Count of triangles: [7]
