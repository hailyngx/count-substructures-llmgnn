Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices according to their degree (number of connections) from least to most. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 1 (Degree 2) - Formerly 4
Vertex 2 (Degree 2) - Formerly 1
Vertex 3 (Degree 2) - Formerly 2
Vertex 4 (Degree 2) - Formerly 5
Vertex 5 (Degree 3) - Formerly 3
Vertex 6 (Degree 4) - Formerly 6
Vertex 7 (Degree 4) - Formerly 9
Vertex 8 (Degree 5) - Formerly 0
Vertex 9 (Degree 5) - Formerly 7
Vertex 10 (Degree 5) - Formerly 8

Now, count the triangles:
