Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degree.

The degrees of the vertices in the graph are:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 1

Next, we relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Vertex 0 (degree 2) -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 1 (degree 2) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 7 (degree 2) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 9 (degree 1) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 2 (degree 4) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 4 (degree 4) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 6 (degree 4) -> Vertex 6 

Now, we will examine each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 6): Check shared connections (4). Triangle formed: <0, 6, 4>
- Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 4): Check shared connections (1, 6). Triangles formed: <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 6>
- Edge (2, 6): Check shared connections (0, 4). No new triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 6): Check shared connections (0, 2). Triangle formed: <4, 6, 0>
- Edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 0): Check shared connections (4). Triangle formed: <6, 0, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are: <0, 6, 4>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 0>.
