Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 4: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 3: Degree 6

Next, we examine each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

For edge (0, 1): Shared connections with node 0: [5, 7], Shared connections with node 1: [5, 7, 9]
  This edge forms 2 triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>

For edge (0, 5): Shared connections with node 0: [1, 7], Shared connections with node 5: [1, 2, 8]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <0, 5, 1>

For edge (0, 7): Shared connections with node 0: [1, 5], Shared connections with node 7: [1, 2, 3, 6]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <0, 7, 1>

For edge (1, 2): Shared connections with node 1: [3, 5, 7, 9], Shared connections with node 2: [3, 5, 7]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <1, 2, 3>

For edge (1, 3): Shared connections with node 1: [5, 7, 9], Shared connections with node 3: [5, 7, 8, 9]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <1, 3, 5>

For edge (1, 5): Shared connections with node 1: [0, 7], Shared connections with node 5: [0, 2, 8]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <1, 5, 0>

For edge (1, 7): Shared connections with node 1: [0, 5, 9], Shared connections with node 7: [0, 2, 3, 6]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <1, 7, 0>

For edge (2, 3): Shared connections with node 2: [5, 7], Shared connections with node 3: [1, 7, 8, 9]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <2, 3, 1>

For edge (2, 5): Shared connections with node 2: [1, 7], Shared connections with node 5: [0, 8]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <2, 5, 0>

For edge (2, 7): Shared connections with node 2: [1, 3, 5], Shared connections with node 7: [0, 3, 6]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <2, 7, 0>

For edge (3, 7): Shared connections with node 3: [1, 7, 8, 9], Shared connections with node 7: [0, 2, 6]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <3, 7, 0>

For edge (3, 9): Shared connections with node 3: [1, 8], Shared connections with node 9: [1, 4, 6]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <3, 9, 1>

For edge (4, 8): Shared connections with node 4: [9], Shared connections with node 8: [3, 5]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <4, 8, 3>

For edge (4, 9): Shared connections with node 4: [8], Shared connections with node 9: [1, 3, 6]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <4, 9, 1>

For edge (5, 8): Shared connections with node 5: [0, 2], Shared connections with node 8: [3, 4]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <5, 8, 3>

For edge (6, 7): Shared connections with node 6: [9], Shared connections with node 7: [0, 2, 3]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <6, 7, 0>

For edge (6, 9): Shared connections with node 6: [7], Shared connections with node 9: [1, 3, 4]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <6, 9, 1>

For edge (7, 9): Shared connections with node 7: [0, 1, 2, 3, 6], Shared connections with node 9: [1, 3, 4, 6]
  This edge forms 1 triangle: <7, 9, 1>

The total number of triangles is [13].
