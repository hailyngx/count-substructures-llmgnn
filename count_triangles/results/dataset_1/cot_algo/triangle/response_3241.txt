Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

Triangles:
- <0, 7, 9>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
