Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  

Node 9: degree 0  
Node 4: degree 1  
Node 1: degree 1  
Node 3: degree 1  
Node 6: degree 1  
Node 7: degree 1  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 0: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 8  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:  
[10]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 2, 8>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<2, 6, 7>  
<2, 6, 8>  
<2, 7, 8>  
<2, 3, 6>  
<2, 3, 7>  
<2, 3, 8>  
<2, 7, 8>
