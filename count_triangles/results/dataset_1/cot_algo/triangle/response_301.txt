Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
By sorting the nodes based on their degree, the new labeling of the nodes is: 

Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 6
Node 2: Degree 7

With this sorted order, we can count the triangles present in the graph.

There are [8] triangles in the graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 7, 8>
<5, 4, 6>
<5, 9, 1>
