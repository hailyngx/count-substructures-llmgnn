Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the vertices are relabeled as follows: 

Node 0 has 2 connections  
Node 1 has 1 connection  
Node 3 has 1 connection  
Node 9 has 1 connection  
Node 7 has 1 connection  
Node 2 has 2 connections  
Node 6 has 3 connections  
Node 8 has 3 connections  
Node 4 has 4 connections  
Node 5 has 5 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check the edges starting from the vertex with the lower label and count the triangles.

### Count of triangles: [6]

### Unique triangles:
<2, 4, 6>  
<4, 5, 6>  
<4, 5, 8>  
<4, 6, 8>  
<2, 4, 5>  
<5, 6, 8>
