Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order: 

Vertices: 
7 (degree 1)
9 (degree 1)
3 (degree 0)
0 (degree 3)
4 (degree 2)
6 (degree 2)
5 (degree 2)
1 (degree 4)
2 (degree 3)
8 (degree 5)

Now, we can count the number of triangles by examining each edge based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections. 

Counting triangles:
- Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 has connections with 1, 2, 4. Vertex 1 has connections with 0, 2, 5, 8. They share a connection with vertex 2, forming the triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (0, 2): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (0, 4): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (1, 5): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has connections with 0, 2, 5, 8. Vertex 8 has connections with 1, 2, 5, 6. They share connections with vertices 2 and 5, forming the triangle <1, 2, 8>.
- Edge (2, 8): Vertex 2 has connections with 0, 1, 8. Vertex 8 has connections with 1, 2, 5, 6. They share connections with vertices 0 and 1, forming the triangle <0, 2, 8>.
- Edge (4, 6): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (5, 8): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (6, 8): Does not form any triangles.
- Edge (7, 9): Does not form any triangles.

Count of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 8>.
