Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices along with their degrees:

Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 3
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 9: degree 1

Now, let's re-label the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 9: 1
Vertex 2: 2
Vertex 5: 2
Vertex 3: 3
Vertex 7: 3
Vertex 8: 3
Vertex 4: 4
Vertex 6: 4

Now, let's check which edges to consider based on the re-labeling:
- (2, 7): Both vertices have degree 3, proceed.
- (3, 4): Vertex 3 has degree 3 (lower label), Vertex 4 has degree 4, proceed.
- (3, 8): Vertex 3 has degree 3 (lower label), Vertex 8 has degree 3, proceed.
- (4, 6): Both vertices have degree 4, proceed.
- (5, 6): Vertex 5 has degree 2 (lower label), Vertex 6 has degree 4, proceed.
- (5, 8): Vertex 5 has degree 2 (lower label), Vertex 8 has degree 3, proceed.
- (6, 7): Vertex 6 has degree 4 (lower label), Vertex 7 has degree 3, proceed.

Now, let's find the triangles formed by these edges:
- <3, 4, 6>
- <5, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]

Triangles found:
<3, 4, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
