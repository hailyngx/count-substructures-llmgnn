Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 1 has 2 connections
Node 0 has 2 connections
Node 7 has 1 connections
Node 4 has 2 connections
Node 6 has 2 connections
Node 9 has 2 connections
Node 8 has 3 connections
Node 3 has 4 connections
Node 5 has 5 connections
Node 2 has 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find that the triangles in the graph are formed by the following sets of vertices:
<1, 5, 2>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 2>
<3, 0, 8>
<3, 2, 5>
<3, 2, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
