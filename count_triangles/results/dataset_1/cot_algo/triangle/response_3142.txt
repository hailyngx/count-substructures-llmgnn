Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

- Node 5: 0 connections
- Node 8: 0 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 6: 6 connections

Next, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 5 (0 connections) -> Node 0
- Node 8 (0 connections) -> Node 1
- Node 0 (3 connections) -> Node 2
- Node 4 (3 connections) -> Node 3
- Node 7 (3 connections) -> Node 4
- Node 1 (4 connections) -> Node 5
- Node 2 (3 connections) -> Node 6
- Node 9 (4 connections) -> Node 7
- Node 3 (3 connections) -> Node 8
- Node 6 (6 connections) -> Node 9

Now, we will count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering:

- Triangle <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle <1, 6, 7>
- Triangle <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle <3, 9, 7>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
