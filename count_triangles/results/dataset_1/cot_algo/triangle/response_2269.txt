Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Degrees: 2, 4, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2

Next, we relabel the vertices according to their degree (from least to most connections):

Vertices: 4, 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 1, 3
Degrees: 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 6

Now, we go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 7) - Check vertices 0 and 7: No triangles.
2. Edge (1, 2) - Check vertices 1 and 2: Triangle <1, 2, 3>.
3. Edge (1, 3) - Check vertices 1 and 3: No additional triangles.
4. Edge (1, 5) - Check vertices 1 and 5: No triangles.
5. Edge (2, 3) - Check vertices 2 and 3: Triangle <1, 2, 3>.
6. Edge (3, 4) - Check vertices 3 and 4: No triangles.
7. Edge (3, 6) - Check vertices 3 and 6: No triangles.
8. Edge (3, 7) - Check vertices 3 and 7: No triangles.
9. Edge (4, 3) - Not considered due to the Degree-Based Ordering method.
10. Edge (5, 1) - Not considered due to the Degree-Based Ordering method.
11. Edge (5, 6) - Not considered due to the Degree-Based Ordering method.
12. Edge (6, 3) - Not considered due to the Degree-Based Ordering method.
13. Edge (6, 5) - Not considered due to the Degree-Based Ordering method.
14. Edge (7, 0) - Not considered due to the Degree-Based Ordering method.
15. Edge (7, 3) - Not considered due to the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 3>.
