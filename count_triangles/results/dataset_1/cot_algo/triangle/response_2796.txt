Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices and their degrees:

Vertices:  
0 - degree 1  
1 - degree 2  
2 - degree 0  
3 - degree 1  
4 - degree 1  
5 - degree 1  
6 - degree 3  
7 - degree 1  
8 - degree 2  
9 - degree 4  

Now, we'll proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method by relabeling the vertices:

Vertices (sorted by degree):  
2 - degree 0  
0 - degree 1  
3 - degree 1  
4 - degree 1  
5 - degree 1  
7 - degree 1  
9 - degree 4  
1 - degree 2  
8 - degree 2  
6 - degree 3  

Next, we'll examine the edges one by one:

Edge (0, 4):  
Both vertices have degree 1, proceed.  
Shared connections: None  

Edge (1, 3):  
Both vertices have degree 1, proceed.  
Shared connections: None  

Edge (1, 9):  
Vertex 1 has degree 2 < Vertex 9 with degree 4, proceed.  
Shared connections: None  

Edge (3, 1):  
Both vertices have degree 1, proceed.  
Shared connections: None  

Edge (4, 0):  
Both vertices have degree 1, proceed.  
Shared connections: None  

Edge (5, 8):  
Both vertices have degree 1, proceed.  
Shared connections: None  

Edge (6, 8):  
Vertex 6 has degree 3 > Vertex 8 with degree 2, skip.  

Edge (6, 9):  
Vertex 6 has degree 3 < Vertex 9 with degree 4, proceed.  
Shared connections: None  

Edge (7, 9):  
Vertex 7 has degree 1 < Vertex 9 with degree 4, proceed.  
Shared connections: None  

Edge (8, 5):  
Both vertices have degree 1, proceed.  
Shared connections: None  

Edge (8, 6):  
Vertex 8 has degree 2 < Vertex 6 with degree 3, proceed.  
Shared connections: None  

Edge (9, 1):  
Vertex 9 has degree 4 > Vertex 1 with degree 2, skip.  

Edge (9, 6):  
Vertex 9 has degree 4 > Vertex 6 with degree 3, skip.  

Edge (9, 7):  
Vertex 9 has degree 4 > Vertex 7 with degree 1, skip.  

After examining all edges, the total number of triangles is [1].

The unique triangle found is <1, 3, 9>.
