Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 5 (degree 0)
- Node 1 (degree 1)
- Node 5 (degree 1)
- Node 1 (degree 2)
- Node 1 (degree 2)
- Node 1 (degree 2)
- Node 1 (degree 2)
- Node 2 (degree 3)
- Node 3 (degree 3)
- Node 2 (degree 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we can find the following: 
- Node 5 and Node 1 share 0 common neighbors.
- Node 5 and Node 5 share 0 common neighbors.
- Node 5 and Node 1 share 0 common neighbors.
- Node 1 and Node 1 share 0 common neighbors.
- Node 1 and Node 1 share 0 common neighbors.
- Node 1 and Node 2 share 0 common neighbors.
- Node 1 and Node 3 share 0 common neighbors.
- Node 1 and Node 2 share 2 common neighbors (Node 0 and Node 4), forming triangle <0, 1, 4>.
- Node 2 and Node 3 share 0 common neighbors.
- Node 2 and Node 2 share 0 common neighbors.
- Node 2 and Node 3 share 2 common neighbors (Node 0 and Node 4), forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- Node 2 and Node 2 share 0 common neighbors.
- Node 2 and Node 1 share 2 common neighbors (Node 3 and Node 8), forming triangle <1, 2, 8>.
- Node 3 and Node 3 share 0 common neighbors.
- Node 3 and Node 2 share 2 common neighbors (Node 0 and Node 4), forming triangle <0, 3, 4>.
- Node 3 and Node 1 share 1 common neighbor (Node 8), forming triangle <1, 3, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
