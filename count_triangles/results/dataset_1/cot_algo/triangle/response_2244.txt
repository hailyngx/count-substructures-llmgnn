Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). In this case, the sorted order of vertices from least to most connections is as follows:
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 6: 7 connections

Now, we will examine each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections to count the triangles.
Let's count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 4): Shared connections with 2, result in triangle <0, 2, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 5): Shared connections with 1, result in triangle <0, 1, 5>.
3. Edge (0, 6): Shared connections with 2, 4, 5, result in triangles <0, 2, 6> and <0, 4, 6>.
4. Edge (0, 8): Shared connections with 2, result in triangle <0, 2, 8>.
5. Edge (1, 5): Shared connection with 0, result in triangle <0, 1, 5>.
6. Edge (1, 6): Shared connections with 0, 2, result in triangle <0, 1, 6>.
7. Edge (1, 7): No triangles as node 1 has more connections than node 7.
8. Edge (1, 9): Shared connections with 3, result in triangle <1, 3, 9>.
9. Edge (2, 4): Shared connection with 0, result in triangle <0, 2, 4>.
10. Edge (2, 6): Shared connections with 0, 4, result in triangle <0, 2, 6>.
11. Edge (3, 7): No triangles as node 3 has more connections than node 7.
12. Edge (3, 8): Shared connection with 0, result in triangle <0, 3, 8>.
13. Edge (3, 9): Shared connection with 1, result in triangle <1, 3, 9>.
14. Edge (4, 9): Shared connection with 0, result in triangle <0, 4, 9>.
15. Edge (6, 9): Shared connections with 0, 4, result in triangle <0, 6, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 9>
