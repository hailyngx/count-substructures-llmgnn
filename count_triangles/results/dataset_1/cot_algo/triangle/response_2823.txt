Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their respective connections:

Node 1 : 2 connections
Node 4 : 2 connections
Node 6 : 2 connections
Node 0 : 4 connections
Node 5 : 4 connections
Node 9 : 4 connections
Node 7 : 5 connections
Node 2 : 6 connections
Node 3 : 8 connections
Node 8 : 4 connections

Now, we will go through each edge to count the number of triangles formed:

For edge (0, 3): Both nodes 0 and 3 have 4 connections each. As 0 < 3, we proceed. Shared connections: 2, 4, 5. Triangle: <0, 3, 2>.
For edge (0, 4): Node 0 has 4 connections and node 4 has 2 connections. As 4 < 0, we proceed. Shared connections: 2, 5. Triangle: <0, 4, 2>.
For edge (0, 5): Both nodes 0 and 5 have 4 connections each. As 0 < 5, we proceed. Shared connections: 2, 4. Triangle: <0, 5, 2>.
For edge (0, 8): Node 0 has 4 connections and node 8 has 4 connections. As 8 < 0, we proceed. Shared connections: 3, 5. No triangle formed.
For edge (1, 3): Both nodes 1 and 3 have 2 connections each. As 1 < 3, we proceed. Shared connections: No triangle formed.
(Continuing similarly for all remaining edges...)

After going through all the edges, the total number of triangles found is [3].

The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 5, 2>
