Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 4: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 6
Node 0: Degree 7

Now, we will list the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Edge (0, 1): Forms triangle with {5}
Edge (0, 5): Forms triangle with {1}
Edge (0, 6): Forms triangle with {7}
Edge (0, 7): Forms triangle with {6}
Edge (1, 2): Forms triangle with {5}
Edge (1, 5): Forms triangle with {0}
Edge (1, 6): Forms triangle with {7} and {0}
Edge (2, 3): Forms triangle with {5}
Edge (2, 5): Forms triangle with {1} and {0}
Edge (4, 6): Forms triangle with {8}
Edge (4, 8): Forms triangle with {6}
Edge (6, 7): Forms triangle with {0}

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [14].
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 6, 7>, <5, 2, 1>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 2, 0>, <6, 4, 8>, <0, 7, 6>, <1, 0, 5>, <7, 6, 0>, <1, 5, 0>, <6, 7, 0>.
