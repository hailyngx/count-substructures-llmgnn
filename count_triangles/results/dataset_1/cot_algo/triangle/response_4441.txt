Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices with their respective connections is as follows:
- Vertex 3: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections
- Vertex 0: 5 connections
- Vertex 2: 5 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

For the edge (0, 2): No triangles formed.
For the edge (0, 5): 1 triangle <0, 2, 5>.
For the edge (0, 6): 1 triangle <0, 2, 6>.
For the edge (0, 9): 2 triangles <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 9>.
For the edge (1, 4): No triangles formed.
For the edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
For the edge (2, 0): No triangles formed.
For the edge (2, 6): 1 triangle <0, 2, 6>.
For the edge (2, 9): 1 triangle <0, 2, 9>.
For the edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
For the edge (3, 8): No triangles formed.
For the edge (4, 1): No triangles formed.
For the edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
For the edge (4, 8): No triangles formed.
For the edge (5, 0): 1 triangle <0, 2, 5>.
For the edge (5, 1): No triangles formed.
For the edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.
For the edge (5, 9): 2 triangles <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 9>.
For the edge (6, 0): No triangles formed.
For the edge (6, 2): 1 triangle <0, 2, 6>.
For the edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
For the edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
For the edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
For the edge (7, 9): 1 triangle <0, 5, 9>.
For the edge (8, 3): No triangles formed.
For the edge (8, 4): No triangles formed.
For the edge (9, 0): 2 triangles <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 9>.
For the edge (9, 2): 1 triangle <0, 2, 9>.
For the edge (9, 5): 2 triangles <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 9>.
For the edge (9, 7): 1 triangle <0, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
