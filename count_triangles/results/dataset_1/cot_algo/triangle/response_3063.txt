Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most connections, the new labeling is:
Vertices: 7, 0, 8, 5, 2, 6, 3, 1, 9, 4

Based on the provided edges and the new labeling, the triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
