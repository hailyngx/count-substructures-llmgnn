Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 4

Sorted by degree in ascending order:
Nodes: 2, 4, 1, 3, 6, 0, 5, 7, 8, 9

Edges to follow this order and corresponding shared connections for triangle counting:
(2, 4) shared connection: 1
(1, 4) shared connection: 2
(1, 7) shared connection: 0
(3, 5) shared connections: 0, 7
(6, 7) shared connection: 0
(6, 8) shared connection: 0
(0, 7) shared connections: 1, 3
(5, 8) shared connection: 0
(5, 2) shared connection: 4
(6, 9) shared connection: 3
(8, 9) shared connections: 3, 6

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] and the unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
