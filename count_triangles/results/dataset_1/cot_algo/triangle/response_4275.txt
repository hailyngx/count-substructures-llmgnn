Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertices: 8, 2, 6, 3, 5, 1, 9, 0, 7, 4

Now we will check each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle with shared connection 7.
- Edge (0, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1.
- Edge (1, 4): Forms a triangle with shared connection 9.
- Edge (1, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0.
- Edge (1, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 4.
- Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 0): Triangle already counted.
- Edge (4, 1): Triangle already counted.
- Edge (4, 9): Triangle already counted.
- Edge (5, 2): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 0): Triangle already counted.
- Edge (7, 1): Triangle already counted.
- Edge (7, 3): Triangle already counted.
- Edge (9, 1): Triangle already counted.
- Edge (9, 4): Triangle already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 7, 3>.
