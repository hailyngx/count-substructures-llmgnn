Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree. Here, the degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: degree 1
Node 1: degree 1
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 2

Sorting the nodes based on their degree:
(1) - Node 0, Node 1 (Degree 1)
(2) - Node 6, Node 7, Node 9 (Degree 2)
(3) - Node 2, Node 4 (Degree 3)
(4) - Node 8 (Degree 4)
(5) - Node 3, Node 5 (Degree 5)

Now, we will calculate the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
