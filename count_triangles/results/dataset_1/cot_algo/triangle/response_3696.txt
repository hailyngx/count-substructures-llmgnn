Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
Nodes: 3 (Degree: 2), 9 (Degree: 2), 5 (Degree: 3), 6 (Degree: 3), 7 (Degree: 3), 1 (Degree: 4), 8 (Degree: 4), 0 (Degree: 5), 4 (Degree: 5), 2 (Degree: 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:
Based on the edges given, the triangles found are: 
<4, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
