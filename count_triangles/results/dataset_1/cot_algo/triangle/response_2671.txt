Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's label the nodes based on their degree:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Edge (1, 3): Node 1 and Node 3 share a connection with Node 7 forming a triangle <1, 3, 7>.
- Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (3, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 9): Nodes 3 and 9 share connections with Nodes 4 and 6 forming two triangles <3, 9, 4> and <3, 9, 6>.
- Edge (4, 3): Already counted.
- Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 3): Already counted.
- Edge (6, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 7): Already counted.
- Edge (8, 9): Nodes 8 and 9 share a connection with Node 3 forming a triangle <8, 9, 3>.
- Edge (9, 3): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 8): Already counted.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <1, 3, 7>, <3, 9, 4>, <3, 9, 6>, <8, 9, 3>.
