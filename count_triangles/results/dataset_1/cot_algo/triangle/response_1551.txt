Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices in order of degree: 3, 2, 8, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 5, 6

Now, let's relabel the vertices: 
3 -> 0
2 -> 1
8 -> 2
3 -> 3
1 -> 4
4 -> 5
1 -> 6
2 -> 7
5 -> 8
6 -> 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles.

We have the following edges:

(0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) 
(1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) 
(2, 3) (2, 6) 
(3, 2) 
(4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) 
(5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) 
(6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) 
(7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) 
(8, 0) 
(9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Edges to consider: (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 4), (1, 5), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 9)

Now, looking at the shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we can count the triangles:

1. Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle: <0, 5, 6>
3. Triangle: <0, 6, 9>
4. Triangle: <0, 9, 5>
5. Triangle: <1, 4, 7>
6. Triangle: <5, 6, 7>
7. Triangle: <5, 7, 9>
8. Triangle: <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [8].
