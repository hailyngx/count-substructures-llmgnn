Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Vertices in order of degree:
1. 1 (degree 1)
2. 5 (degree 1)
3. 8 (degree 2)
4. 5 (degree 2) - tied
5. 1 (degree 2) - tied
6. 4 (degree 3)
7. 7 (degree 3)
8. 8 (degree 3)
9. 9 (degree 3)
10. 3 (degree 4)
11. 2 (degree 4)
12. 6 (degree 5)
13. 0 (degree 5)

Now, we will examine the edges based on the ordering of vertices:

1. Edge (1, 2): Not considered as vertex 1 has degree 1 and vertex 2 has degree 4.
2. Edge (5, 6): Not considered as vertex 5 has degree 1 and vertex 6 has degree 5.
3. Edge (8, 3): Considered as both vertices have fewer connections.
   - Shared connections with vertex 8: 7
   - Triangle: <3, 7, 8>
4. Edge (5, 6): Not considered for the same reasons as above.
5. Edge (1, 2): Not considered for the same reasons as above.
6. Edge (4, 6): Considered as both vertices have fewer connections.
   - Shared connections with vertex 4: 0, 7
   - Triangle: <4, 0, 6>, <4, 7, 6>
7. Edge (7, 8): Considered as both vertices have fewer connections.
   - Shared connections with vertex 7: 4, 6
   - Triangle: <7, 4, 8>, <7, 6, 8>
8. Edge (9, 0): Considered as both vertices have fewer connections.
   - Shared connections with vertex 9: 2
   - Triangle: <9, 0, 2>
9. Edge (9, 2): Considered as both vertices have fewer connections.
   - Shared connections with vertex 9: 0
   - Triangle: <9, 0, 2>
10. Edge (9, 3): Not considered as vertex 3 has degree 4 and vertex 9 has degree 3.
11. Edge (4, 0): Considered as both vertices have fewer connections.
    - Shared connection with vertex 4: 6
    - Triangle: <4, 6, 0>
12. Edge (6, 4): Considered as both vertices have fewer connections.
    - Shared connection with vertex 6: 0, 7
    - Triangle: <6, 0, 4>, <6, 7, 4>
13. Edge (7, 4): Not considered for the same reasons as above.
14. Edge (8, 7): Not considered for the same reasons as above.
15. Edge (2, 3): Not considered for the same reasons as above.
16. Edge (3, 8): Not considered for the same reasons as above.
17. Edge (3, 9): Not considered for the same reasons as above.
18. Edge (4, 7): Not considered for the same reasons as above.
19. Edge (4, 6): Not considered for the same reasons as above.
20. Edge (4, 0): Not considered for the same reasons as above.
21. Edge (0, 9): Not considered for the same reasons as above.
22. Edge (0, 6): Not considered for the same reasons as above.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
The unique triangles found are <3, 7, 8>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 7, 6>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 6, 8>, <9, 0, 2>, <6, 0, 4>.
