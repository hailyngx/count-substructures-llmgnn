Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0 has 1 connection.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can find the triangles in the graph:

- Triangle <2, 7, 8>
- Triangle <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
