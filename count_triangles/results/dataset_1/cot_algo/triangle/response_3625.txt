Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections from least to most, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows: 
Node 0 -> 2 connections
Node 1 -> 2 connections
Node 7 -> 2 connections
Node 9 -> 1 connection
Node 6 -> 2 connections
Node 3 -> 3 connections
Node 8 -> 3 connections
Node 4 -> 3 connections
Node 5 -> 5 connections
Node 2 -> 5 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 2): Nodes 0 and 2 do not share any common neighbors.

2. Edge (0, 4): Nodes 0 and 4 do not share any common neighbors.

3. Edge (1, 3): Nodes 1 and 3 do not share any common neighbors.

4. Edge (1, 4): Nodes 1 and 4 do not share any common neighbors.

5. Edge (2, 3): Nodes 2 and 3 do not share any common neighbors.

6. Edge (2, 6): Nodes 2 and 6 do not share any common neighbors.

7. Edge (2, 8): Nodes 2 and 8 do not share any common neighbors.

8. Edge (3, 5): Nodes 3 and 5 do not share any common neighbors.

9. Edge (4, 5): Nodes 4 and 5 share Node 0 as a common neighbor, forming a triangle <0, 4, 5>.

10. Edge (5, 7): Nodes 5 and 7 do not share any common neighbors.

11. Edge (5, 8): Nodes 5 and 8 do not share any common neighbors.

12. Edge (5, 9): Nodes 5 and 9 do not share any common neighbors.

13. Edge (6, 7): Nodes 6 and 7 do not share any common neighbors.

14. Edge (7, 8): Nodes 7 and 8 do not share any common neighbors.

The total number of triangles is [1], and the unique triangle found is <0, 4, 5>.
