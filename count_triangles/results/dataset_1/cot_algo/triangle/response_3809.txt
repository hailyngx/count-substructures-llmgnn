Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 1 connection
8: 1 connection
2: 3 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
9: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices as follows:
0 → 0
1 → 1
3 → 2
6 → 3
7 → 4
8 → 5
2 → 6
4 → 7
5 → 8
9 → 9

Next, we will consider each edge and count the number of triangles:
(0, 9): None
(1, 5): None
(2, 4): None
(2, 8): None
(3, 5): None
(4, 2): None
(4, 9): None
(5, 1): None
(5, 3): None
(5, 6): None
(6, 5): None
(7, 9): None
(8, 2): None
(9, 0): None
(9, 4): None
(9, 7): None

Total number of triangles: [0]
