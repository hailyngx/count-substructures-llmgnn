Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following new labels:
Node 8 has 0 connections.
Nodes 0, 5, 7, and 9 have 1 connection.
Nodes 1 and 2 have 2 connections.
Nodes 4 and 6 have 4 connections.
Node 3 has 6 connections.

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <1, 2, 4>
3. <1, 4, 6>
4. <1, 5, 3>
5. <3, 4, 6>
6. <3, 4, 7>
7. <3, 5, 1>
8. <4, 6, 0>
9. <4, 6, 1>

Total number of triangles: [9]
