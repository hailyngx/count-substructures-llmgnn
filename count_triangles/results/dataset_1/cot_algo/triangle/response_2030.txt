Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 5 is connected to 1 other node.
Nodes 1, 2, 7 are connected to 2 other nodes.
Nodes 4, 8 are connected to 3 other nodes.
Nodes 0, 6, 9 are connected to 4 other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to 5 other nodes.

Now, let's relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 5 (degree 1) -> Node 1
Nodes 1, 2, 7 (degree 2) -> Nodes 2, 3, 4
Nodes 4, 8 (degree 3) -> Nodes 5, 6
Nodes 0, 6, 9 (degree 4) -> Nodes 7, 8, 9
Node 3 (degree 5) -> Node 0

Next, let's count the number of triangles:
For each edge, we will only consider cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Checking the edges now:
- Edge (0, 1): both nodes have degree 4, no triangle
- Edge (0, 3): Node 0 has degree 4, Node 3 has degree 5, no triangle
- Edge (0, 4): Node 0 has degree 4, Node 5 has degree 3, no triangle
- Edge (0, 9): Node 0 has degree 4, Node 8 has degree 3, possible triangle <0, 8, 9>
- Edge (1, 6): Both nodes have degree 2, no triangle
- Edge (2, 3): Node 2 has degree 2, Node 3 has degree 5, no triangle
- Edge (2, 8): Node 2 has degree 2, Node 5 has degree 3, no triangle
- Edge (3, 7): Node 3 has degree 5, Node 4 has degree 3, possible triangle <3, 5, 6>
- Edge (4, 6): Node 5 has degree 3, Node 6 has degree 4, no triangle
- Edge (5, 6): Both nodes have degree 1, no triangle
- Edge (6, 8): Node 6 has degree 4, Node 5 has degree 3, possible triangle <5, 6, 8>
- Edge (7, 9): Node 7 has degree 4, Node 8 has degree 3, no triangle
- Edge (8, 9): Node 8 has degree 3, Node 9 has degree 4, no triangle

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 6>
