Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the edges to consider are:
(1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 9), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 8)

Calculating the triangles formed by these edges:
- <1, 2, 7>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
