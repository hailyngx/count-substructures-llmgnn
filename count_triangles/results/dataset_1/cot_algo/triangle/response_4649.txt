Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 9 has 1 connection
- Node 1 has 2 connections
- Node 4 has 2 connections
- Node 2 has 3 connections
- Node 6 has 3 connections
- Node 7 has 3 connections
- Node 0 has 4 connections
- Node 8 has 4 connections
- Node 5 has 5 connections
- Node 3 has 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge based on the labels of its vertices. 

After counting the triangles and implementing the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 2>, <5, 2, 6>.
