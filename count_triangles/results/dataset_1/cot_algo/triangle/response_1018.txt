Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
- Node 1 -> Node 1 (degree 2)
- Node 3 -> Node 2 (degree 2)
- Node 5 -> Node 3 (degree 2)
- Node 7 -> Node 4 (degree 3)
- Node 6 -> Node 5 (degree 3)
- Node 2 -> Node 6 (degree 3)
- Node 4 -> Node 7 (degree 4)
- Node 8 -> Node 8 (degree 5)

Next, we will count the triangles formed:
- Node 1 (2) and Node 4 (4) share Node 8 (1) -> <1, 4, 8>
- Node 1 (2) and Node 8 (5) share Node 4 (2) -> <1, 4, 8>
- Node 4 (4) and Node 8 (5) share Node 6 (3) -> <4, 6, 8>
- Node 4 (4) and Node 8 (5) share Node 7 (3) -> <4, 6, 8>
- Node 6 (3) and Node 7 (3) share Node 8 (5) -> <6, 7, 8>
- Node 6 (3) and Node 8 (5) share Node 4 (2) -> <4, 6, 8>
- Node 2 (3) and Node 5 (2) share Node 3 (2) -> <2, 3, 5>
- Node 2 (3) and Node 6 (3) share Node 7 (3) -> <2, 6, 7>
- Node 2 (3) and Node 7 (3) share Node 6 (3) -> <2, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9] and the unique triangles found are <1, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, and <2, 6, 7>.
