Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 6 has 0 connections.
Nodes 5 and 6 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 4 and 7 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 0, 1, and 2 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 3 and 9 have 6 connections each.
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 should be relabeled in increasing order.

The sorted edges according to the vertex labels are:
(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9).

Now, let's calculate the triangles based on the shared connections between vertices with lower labels:

Triangles: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 4]
