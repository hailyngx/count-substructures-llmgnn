Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following list: 

Node 4 has 2 connections.  
Node 1 has 2 connections.  
Node 6 has 2 connections.  
Node 0 has 2 connections.  
Node 5 has 5 connections.  
Node 9 has 5 connections.  
Node 7 has 5 connections.  
Node 2 has 2 connections.  
Node 3 has 5 connections.  
Node 8 has 5 connections.  

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 

- Starting with the edge (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 share a connection with Node 3, forming a triangle <0, 3, 5>.

- Moving on to the edge (0, 9): Nodes 0 and 9 do not share a connection, so no triangles here.

- For the edge (1, 5): Nodes 1 and 5 share a connection with Node 3, forming a triangle <1, 3, 5>.

- Analyzing (1, 6): Nodes 1 and 6 do not share a connection, so no triangles here.

- For the edge (2, 3): Nodes 2 and 3 do not share a connection, so no triangles here.

- Moving on to (2, 7): Nodes 2 and 7 do not share a connection, so no triangles here.

- For (3, 5): Nodes 3 and 5 share a connection with Node 8, forming a triangle <3, 5, 8>.

- Analyzing (3, 6): Nodes 3 and 6 share a connection with Node 1, forming a triangle <1, 3, 6>.

- For (3, 8): Nodes 3 and 8 do not share a connection, so no triangles here.

- Moving on to (4, 9): Nodes 4 and 9 do not share a connection, so no triangles here.

- For (5, 8): Nodes 5 and 8 share a connection with Node 3, forming a triangle <3, 5, 8>.

- Analyzing (6, 1): Nodes 6 and 1 share a connection with Node 3, forming a triangle <1, 3, 6>.

- For (7, 2): Nodes 7 and 2 do not share a connection, so no triangles here.

- Moving on to (7, 8): Nodes 7 and 8 share a connection with Node 3, forming a triangle <3, 7, 8>.

- For (7, 9): Nodes 7 and 9 do not share a connection, so no triangles here.

- Analyzing (8, 3): Nodes 8 and 3 share a connection with Node 5, forming a triangle <3, 5, 8>.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
