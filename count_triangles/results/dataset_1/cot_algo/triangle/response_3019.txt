Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:  
Vertex 1: <1>  
Vertex 2: <2>  
Vertex 9: <3>  
Vertex 7: <4>  
Vertex 4: <5>  
Vertex 3: <6>  
Vertex 6: <7>  
Vertex 5: <8>  
Vertex 8: <9>  
Vertex 0: <10>  

Triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method are:  
<0, 3, 8>  
<0, 4, 8>  
<1, 2, 8>  
<1, 4, 7>  
<4, 5, 7>  
<3, 4, 8>  

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
