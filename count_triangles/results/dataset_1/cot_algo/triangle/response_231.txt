Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections, we get the following order:  
Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 0, 4, 5, 6: 2 connections  
Node 9: 3 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 3: 5 connections  
Node 2: 6 connections  
Node 7: 6 connections  

Using the degree-based ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:  
(0, 1), (1, 0), (5, 2), (7, 6), (8, 7), (9, 8)  
Triangles found:  
<0, 1, 3>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
