Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following order:
Node 7 (degree 0)
Node 9 (degree 0)
Nodes 1, 5 (degree 1)
Nodes 2, 4, 6 (degree 2)
Nodes 0, 8 (degree 3)
Node 3 (degree 4)

After relabeling, the graph edges are as follows:
(0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8)

Now, we count the triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<2, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
