Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labelings are:
- Node 0 with 1 connection
- Node 4 with 1 connection
- Node 5 with 1 connection
- Node 9 with 1 connection
- Node 3 with 2 connections
- Node 6 with 3 connections
- Node 7 with 3 connections
- Node 8 with 3 connections
- Node 1 with 6 connections
- Node 2 with 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges:
1. Edge (0, 2) is skipped.
2. Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 1.
3. Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 1.
4. Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 1.
5. Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 1 and 7.
6. Edge (1, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 1.
7. Edge (2, 0) is skipped.
8. Edge (2, 1) is skipped.
9. Edge (2, 6) is skipped.
10. Edge (3, 1) is skipped.
11. Edge (3, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 6.
12. Edge (4, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 1.
13. Edge (4, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 8.
14. Edge (5, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 7.
15. Edge (5, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 8.
16. Edge (6, 2) is skipped.
17. Edge (6, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 6.
18. Edge (6, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 6.
19. Edge (7, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 1.
20. Edge (7, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 5.
21. Edge (7, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9.
22. Edge (8, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 1.
23. Edge (8, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 4.
24. Edge (8, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 5.
25. Edge (9, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 6.
26. Edge (9, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14], and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 3>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <4, 8, 5>, <5, 8, 7>, <6, 3, 9>, <7, 5, 8>, <9, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 9, 7>, <4, 8, 1>.
