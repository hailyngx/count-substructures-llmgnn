Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, the new order is: 

Node 4 (Degree 1)
Node 5 (Degree 1)
Node 8 (Degree 1)
Node 7 (Degree 2)
Node 1 (Degree 2)
Node 6 (Degree 2)
Node 3 (Degree 3)
Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 2 (Degree 4)
Node 9 (Degree 5)

Now, we will go through the edges following the rule that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Checking each edge, we find the following triangles: 

- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 2, 9>
- <0, 6, 1>
- <0, 6, 2>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <3, 9, 5>
- <7, 9, 4>
- <7, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
