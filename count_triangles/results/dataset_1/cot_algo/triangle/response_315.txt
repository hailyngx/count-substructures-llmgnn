Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) from least to most. The sorted order for this graph is: 0, 6, 5, 7, 9, 3, 1, 5, 2, 8.

Next, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <7, 8, 9> (Shared connection at vertex 8)
- Triangle <2, 3, 8> (Shared connection at vertex 8)
- Triangle <2, 4, 8> (Shared connection at vertex 8)

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
