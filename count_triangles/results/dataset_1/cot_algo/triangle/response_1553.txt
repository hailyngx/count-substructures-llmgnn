Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 2 edges
Node 5: 1 edge
Node 9: 3 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 2: 2 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 7: 5 edges
Node 4: 5 edges

Now, we will check each edge starting from the vertex with the lower label:

- Edge (0, 4) with shared connection 8 forms a triangle: <0, 4, 8>
- Edge (1, 6) with shared connection 7 forms a triangle: <1, 6, 7>
- Edge (1, 7) with shared connection 6 forms a triangle: <1, 6, 7>
- Edge (1, 8) with shared connection 3 forms a triangle: <1, 3, 8>
- Edge (1, 9) with shared connection 7 forms a triangle: <1, 7, 9>
- Edge (2, 6) with shared connection 7 forms a triangle: <2, 6, 7>
- Edge (3, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 7) with shared connection 1 forms a triangle: <1, 3, 7>
- Edge (3, 8) with shared connection 1 forms a triangle: <1, 3, 8>
- Edge (4, 6) with shared connection 7 forms a triangle: <4, 6, 7>
- Edge (4, 7) with shared connection 6 forms a triangle: <4, 6, 7>
- Edge (4, 9) with shared connection 1 forms a triangle: <1, 4, 9>
- Edge (8, 6) with shared connection 4 forms a triangle: <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (8, 3) with shared connection 1 forms a triangle: <1, 3, 8>
- Edge (9, 1) with shared connection 7 forms a triangle: <1, 7, 9>
- Edge (9, 4) with shared connection 1 forms a triangle: <1, 4, 9>
- Edge (9, 7) with shared connection 1 forms a triangle: <1, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [8].
