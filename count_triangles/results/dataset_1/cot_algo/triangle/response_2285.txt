Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds as follows:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections:
- Vertex 5: 0 connections
- Vertex 9: 0 connections
- Vertex 10: 0 connections
- Vertex 3: 1 connection
- Vertex 6: 1 connection
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 3 connections
- Vertex 2: 7 connections

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Vertex 5: 0 connections → Label 1
- Vertex 9: 0 connections → Label 2
- Vertex 10: 0 connections → Label 3
- Vertex 3: 1 connection → Label 4
- Vertex 6: 1 connection → Label 5
- Vertex 7: 1 connection → Label 6
- Vertex 8: 1 connection → Label 7
- Vertex 4: 2 connections → Label 8
- Vertex 1: 3 connections → Label 9
- Vertex 2: 7 connections → Label 10

3. Check for triangles:
- (1, 2): Shared connections with 4, 3, 6, 7, 8
  - Triangles: <1, 2, 4> <1, 2, 3> <1, 2, 6> <1, 2, 7> <1, 2, 8>
- (1, 3): No triangles
- (1, 4): No triangles
- (2, 4): No triangles
- (2, 6): Shared connection with 7
  - Triangle: <2, 6, 7> 
- (2, 7): No triangles
- (2, 8): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [5]
Triangles found: <1, 2, 4> <1, 2, 3> <1, 2, 6> <1, 2, 7> <1, 2, 8>
