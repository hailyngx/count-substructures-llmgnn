Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 1 connection.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 5 connections.

Now, we will iterate through the edges based on the node with the lower label having fewer connections:

Edge (0, 1): Node 0 and Node 1 share no common connections.
Edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 share no common connections.
Edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 share no common connections.
Edge (0, 7): Node 0 and Node 7 share common connections with Node 2 and Node 4, forming triangles <0, 2, 7> and <0, 4, 7>.
Edge (1, 9): Node 1 and Node 9 share no common connections.
Edge (2, 7): Node 2 and Node 7 share common connections with Node 0 and Node 4, forming triangles <0, 2, 7> and <2, 4, 7>.
Edge (3, 4): Node 3 and Node 4 share no common connections.
Edge (3, 6): Node 3 and Node 6 share no common connections.
Edge (5, 6): Node 5 and Node 6 share no common connections.
Edge (7, 8): Node 7 and Node 8 share no common connections.
Edge (7, 9): Node 7 and Node 9 share no common connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, and <2, 4, 7>.
