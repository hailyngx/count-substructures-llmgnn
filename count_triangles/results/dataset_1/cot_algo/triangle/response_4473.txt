Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
Vertices with 1 connection: 1, 6, 8
Vertices with 2 connections: 5
Vertices with 3 connections: 2
Vertices with 4 connections: 3, 7
Vertices with 5 connections: 4, 9
Vertices with 6 connections: 0

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 has 6 connections and Vertex 3 has 4 connections. Count 1 triangle: <0, 3, 2>.
2. Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 has 6 connections and Vertex 4 has 5 connections. Count 1 triangle: <0, 4, 9>.
3. Edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 has 6 connections and Vertex 7 has 4 connections. Count 1 triangle: <0, 7, 5>.
4. Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has 6 connections and Vertex 8 has 1 connection. No triangle counted.
5. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has 6 connections and Vertex 9 has 5 connections. Count 1 triangle: <0, 9, 4>.
6. Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 has 1 connection and Vertex 5 has 3 connections. No triangle counted.
7. Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has 1 connection and Vertex 8 has 1 connection. No triangle counted.
8. Edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 has 3 connections and Vertex 3 has 4 connections. Count 1 triangle: <2, 3, 0>.
9. Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 has 3 connections and Vertex 4 has 5 connections. Count 1 triangle: <2, 4, 0>.
10. Edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has 3 connections and Vertex 9 has 5 connections. Count 1 triangle: <2, 9, 0>.
11. Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 has 4 connections and Vertex 4 has 5 connections. Count 1 triangle: <3, 4, 0>.
12. Edge (4, 9): Vertex 4 has 5 connections and Vertex 9 has 5 connections. Count 1 triangle: <4, 9, 0>.
13. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has 3 connections and Vertex 7 has 4 connections. Count 1 triangle: <5, 7, 0>.
14. Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 has 3 connections and Vertex 9 has 5 connections. Count 1 triangle: <5, 9, 0>.
15. Edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 has 1 connection and Vertex 7 has 4 connections. No triangle counted.
16. Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 has 1 connection and Vertex 9 has 5 connections. No triangle counted.
17. Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has 4 connections and Vertex 9 has 5 connections. Count 1 triangle: <7, 9, 0>.

Total number of triangles: [7]
