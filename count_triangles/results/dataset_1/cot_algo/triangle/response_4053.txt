Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each node to determine the degree-based ordering. 
Here are the degrees of each node in ascending order: 
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 6

Next, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order: 
Node 4 (Degree 1) will be relabeled as Node 0
Node 1 (Degree 2) will be relabeled as Node 1
Node 3 (Degree 2) will be relabeled as Node 2
Node 9 (Degree 2) will be relabeled as Node 3
Node 5 (Degree 2) will be relabeled as Node 4
Node 8 (Degree 2) will be relabeled as Node 5
Node 6 (Degree 2) will be relabeled as Node 6
Node 2 (Degree 3) will be relabeled as Node 7
Node 7 (Degree 4) will be relabeled as Node 8
Node 0 (Degree 6) will be relabeled as Node 9

Now, we will list the edges according to the new labeling:
(0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5)

Using the degree-based ordering method, we can now count the triangles by checking shared connections between the lower labeled vertices:
Triangles: 
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 0, 4>
<2, 0, 5>
<2, 0, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 2, 9>
Total number of triangles: [11]
