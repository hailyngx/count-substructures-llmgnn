Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degrees of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 5
- Node 3: Degree 2
- Node 4: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 2
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 2

Now, we will relabel the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:
- Node 1 (Degree 2) -> Node 0
- Nodes 3, 4, 5, 9 (Degree 2) -> Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4
- Nodes 6, 7, 8 (Degree 3) -> Nodes 5, 6, 7
- Node 0 (Degree 4) -> Node 8
- Node 2 (Degree 5) -> Node 9

Next, we will look at each of the edges in this order to count the number of triangles:
1. (0, 2): No triangles formed.
2. (0, 3): No triangles formed.
3. (0, 6): No triangles formed.
4. (0, 7): No triangles formed.
5. (1, 2): No triangles formed.
6. (1, 6): No triangles formed.
7. (2, 0): No triangles formed.
8. (2, 1): No triangles formed.
9. (2, 4): Triangle <2, 4, 8>.
10. (2, 8): No triangles formed.
11. (2, 9): No triangles formed.
12. (3, 0): No triangles formed.
13. (3, 7): No triangles formed.
14. (4, 2): Triangle <2, 4, 8>.
15. (4, 8): No triangles formed.
16. (5, 7): No triangles formed.
17. (5, 8): No triangles formed.
18. (6, 0): No triangles formed.
19. (6, 1): No triangles formed.
20. (6, 9): No triangles formed.
21. (7, 0): No triangles formed.
22. (7, 3): No triangles formed.
23. (7, 5): No triangles formed.
24. (8, 2): Triangle <2, 4, 8>.
25. (8, 4): No triangles formed.
26. (8, 5): No triangles formed.
27. (9, 2): No triangles formed.
28. (9, 6): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found in the graph are <2, 4, 8>.
