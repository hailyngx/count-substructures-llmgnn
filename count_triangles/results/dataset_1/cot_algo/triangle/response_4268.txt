Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 3 --> 0 connections
Node 4 --> 0 connections
Node 1 --> 2 connections
Node 9 --> 2 connections
Node 5 --> 3 connections
Node 8 --> 3 connections
Node 6 --> 3 connections
Node 7 --> 4 connections
Node 2 --> 4 connections
Node 0 --> 4 connections

Now, we proceed to count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <0, 7, 4>
- Triangle <0, 7, 5>
- Triangle <0, 7, 8>
- Triangle <0, 8, 5>
- Triangle <0, 9, 2>
- Triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle <5, 7, 0>
- Triangle <5, 7, 4>
- Triangle <5, 7, 8>
- Triangle <7, 0, 4>
- Triangle <7, 0, 5>
- Triangle <7, 0, 8>
- Triangle <7, 4, 5>
- Triangle <7, 5, 0>
- Triangle <7, 5, 8>
- Triangle <8, 0, 5>
- Triangle <8, 5, 7>
- Triangle <9, 0, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [21].
