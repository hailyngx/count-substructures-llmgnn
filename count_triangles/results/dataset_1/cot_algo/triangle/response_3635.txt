Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling the vertices based on the number of connections, we get the following list of edges in sorted order:

(1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (5, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (5, 8) (6, 8) (1, 6) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (5, 8) (6, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (4, 5) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 9)

Now, let's count the triangles by looking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge:

1. Triangle: <0, 5, 8>
2. Triangle: <0, 5, 9>
3. Triangle: <1, 6, 8>
4. Triangle: <4, 5, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 4]
