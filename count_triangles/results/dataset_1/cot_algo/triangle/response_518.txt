Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the degree of each node:

Node 0: 4 edges
Node 1: 3 edges
Node 2: 2 edges
Node 3: 2 edges
Node 4: 1 edge
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 7: 2 edges
Node 8: 6 edges
Node 9: 4 edges

Now, we will reorder the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 4 (1 edge) 
Node 2 (2 edges) 
Node 3 (2 edges) 
Node 7 (2 edges) 
Node 1 (3 edges) 
Node 0 (4 edges) 
Node 9 (4 edges) 
Node 6 (4 edges) 
Node 8 (6 edges) 

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge starting from the nodes with the lowest degrees.

Triangles:
1. <0, 7, 8>
2. <0, 7, 8>
3. <0, 7, 8>
4. <0, 7, 8>
5. <0, 8, 1>
6. <6, 1, 8>
7. <6, 1, 8>
8. <6, 1, 8>
9. <6, 4, 1>
10. <6, 4, 1>
11. <6, 4, 1>

Total number of triangles: [11]
