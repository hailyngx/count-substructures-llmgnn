Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Vertex 0 with degree 2
Vertex 5 with degree 1
Vertex 8 with degree 1
Vertex 6 with degree 3
Vertex 2 with degree 2
Vertex 9 with degree 4
Vertex 7 with degree 4
Vertex 1 with degree 5
Vertex 3 with degree 5
Vertex 4 with degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we find: 
- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <1, 3, 4>
- Triangle <1, 6, 7>
- Triangle <3, 4, 7>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
