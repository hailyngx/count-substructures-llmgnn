Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The sorted list of vertices based on their number of connections is: 
1. 7 (Degree: 1)
2. 5 (Degree: 2)
3. 3 (Degree: 2)
4. 9 (Degree: 3)
5. 1 (Degree: 4)
6. 7 (Degree: 1)
7. 0 (Degree: 4)
8. 6 (Degree: 4)
9. 4 (Degree: 5)
10. 2 (Degree: 5)

Now, using the edges and the sorted vertices list, we count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 9>
