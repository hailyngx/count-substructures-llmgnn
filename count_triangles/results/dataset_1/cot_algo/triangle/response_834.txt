Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently. First, let's label the vertices according to their degree:

Vertex 0 has degree 5
Vertex 1 has degree 5
Vertex 2 has degree 3
Vertex 3 has degree 3
Vertex 4 has degree 5
Vertex 5 has degree 4
Vertex 6 has degree 3
Vertex 7 has degree 4
Vertex 8 has degree 5
Vertex 9 has degree 3

Next, we will identify the triangles:

Vertices (2, 3, 8) form a triangle
Vertices (0, 4, 5) form a triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <2, 3, 8> and <0, 4, 5>.
