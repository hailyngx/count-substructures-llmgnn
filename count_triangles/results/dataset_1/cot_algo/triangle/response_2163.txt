Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degree from least to most connected, the new edge list becomes: (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 9) (:6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7)

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles: 
<1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 0>, <1, 7, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 1, 9>, <7, 5, 9>, <8, 1, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
