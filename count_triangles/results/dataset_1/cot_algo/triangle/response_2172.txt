Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Degrees: 2, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2

Now we relabel the vertices in ascending order of degrees:
Vertices: 3, 7, 0, 2, 5, 9, 1, 6, 8, 4

Next, we will list the edges following the relabeling:
Edges: (3, 8) (7, 6) (0, 8) (2, 1) (5, 6) (9, 8) (1, 4) (6, 1) (8, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 8) (6, 7) (8, 9)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
Triangles: [10]
Unique triangles: <1, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 5, 1>, <6, 7, 4>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 1>, <8, 9, 4>, <8, 0, 4>
