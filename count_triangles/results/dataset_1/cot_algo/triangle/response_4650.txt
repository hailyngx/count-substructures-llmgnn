Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0 - Degree 2
Node 1 - Degree 0
Node 3 - Degree 0
Node 5 - Degree 0
Node 8 - Degree 0
Node 4 - Degree 2
Node 7 - Degree 3
Node 9 - Degree 3
Node 6 - Degree 6
Node 2 - Degree 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:
- Triangle <2, 0, 3> (Formed by edges (0, 2), (0, 3), and (2, 3))
- Triangle <2, 4, 6> (Formed by edges (2, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 6))
- Triangle <2, 6, 7> (Formed by edges (2, 6), (6, 2), and (6, 7))
- Triangle <2, 6, 9> (Formed by edges (2, 6), (6, 9), and (9, 2))
- Triangle <2, 6, 4> (Formed by edges (2, 4), (4, 6), and (6, 2))
- Triangle <2, 6, 8> (Formed by edges (2, 6), (6, 8), and (8, 2))
- Triangle <6, 7, 9> (Formed by edges (6, 9), (6, 7), and (7, 9))
- Triangle <6, 7, 5> (Formed by edges (6, 7), (6, 5), and (7, 5))

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
