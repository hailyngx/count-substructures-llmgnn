Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
1. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees:  
- Node 8 has 2 edges.  
- Node 2 has 2 edges.  
- Node 7 has 2 edges.  
- Node 6 has 3 edges.  
- Node 9 has 3 edges.  
- Node 4 has 4 edges.  
- Node 3 has 4 edges.  
- Node 1 has 4 edges.  
- Node 5 has 5 edges.  
- Node 0 has 5 edges.  

2. Sort the nodes based on their degrees: 8 < 2 < 7 < 6 < 9 < 4 < 3 < 1 < 5 < 0

3. Count the total number of triangles:
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle <1, 5, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
