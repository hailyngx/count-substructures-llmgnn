Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabeling them accordingly, we get:
Vertices: 7, 0, 1, 4, 6, 9, 5, 3, 8, 2

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges considering the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections.

Examining the edges in the graph, we find the following triangles:
- <1, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 4>
- <2, 5, 3>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <2, 8, 0>
- <8, 9, 0>
- <8, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
