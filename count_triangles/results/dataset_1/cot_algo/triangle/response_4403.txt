Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After implementing the Degree-Based Ordering method on the given graph, the vertices will be relabeled as follows based on their degrees:

Vertex 0: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 1
Vertex 3: Degree 1
Vertex 7: Degree 2
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 2
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 1: Degree 6
Vertex 6: Degree 6
Vertex 8: Degree 5

Using this labeling, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

The triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
