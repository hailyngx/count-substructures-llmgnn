Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on the number of connections, the new ordering is as follows:
- Vertex 0: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 5 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 1 connection
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles:

Triangles:
1. <0, 3, 1>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 4, 1>
4. <0, 4, 5>

Total number of triangles: [4]
