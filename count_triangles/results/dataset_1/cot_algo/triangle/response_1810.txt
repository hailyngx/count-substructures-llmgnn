Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the degree of each node from the given edges:

- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 1

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 1 (degree 1) becomes node 0
- Node 8 (degree 1) becomes node 1
- Node 9 (degree 1) becomes node 2
- Node 6 (degree 2) becomes node 3
- Node 7 (degree 3) becomes node 4
- Node 2 (degree 3) becomes node 5
- Node 0 (degree 3) becomes node 6
- Node 5 (degree 4) becomes node 7
- Node 3 (degree 4) becomes node 8
- Node 4 (degree 4) becomes node 9

Now, we'll list the edges based on the new node labels and only consider edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

(0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 8)

Now, we'll count the triangles formed by these edges:

- Triangle 1: <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle 2: <0, 6, 3>
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 4: <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle 5: <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
