Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 3 with 1 edge
- Nodes 0, 6, 8, 9 with 2 edges
- Nodes 2, 5 with 3 edges
- Nodes 1, 7, 4 with 5 edges

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Looking at the 1-edge nodes, Node 3 (labeled as A) does not form any triangles.
2. Moving on to the 2-edge nodes (Nodes 0, 6, 8, 9), there are no triangles formed by these nodes.
3. Examining the 3-edge nodes (Nodes 2, 5), we find the following triangles:
    - <2, 1, 5>
4. Analyzing the 5-edge nodes (Nodes 1, 7, 4):
    - <1, 0, 4>
    - <1, 7, 6>
    - <1, 7, 9>
    - <1, 2, 4>
    - <1, 4, 7>
    - <1, 4, 8>
    - <1, 4, 5>
    - <1, 5, 3>
    - <1, 5, 4>
    - <1, 6, 7>
    - <1, 7, 9>
    - <1, 9, 7>

After counting all the triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
