Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new ordering is as follows: 

Node 6: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

1. (0, 4): Shares connections with nodes 1 (4) and 7 (0). Forms triangle <0, 4, 7>.
2. (0, 7): Shares connections with nodes 4 (7) and 2 (7). Forms triangle <0, 7, 4>.
3. (1, 4): Shares connection with node 5 (1). Does not form a triangle.
4. (1, 5): Shares no connections.
5. (2, 3): Shares connection with node 7 (3). Does not form a triangle.
6. (2, 7): Shares connections with nodes 3 (7) and 0 (7). Forms triangle <0, 2, 7>.
7. (3, 2): Already counted in (2, 7).
8. (3, 7): Already counted in (2, 7).
9. (3, 8): Shares no connections.
10. (4, 0): Already counted in (0, 4).
11. (4, 1): Shares connection with node 5 (1). Does not form a triangle.
12. (4, 8): Shares connections with nodes 9 (4) and 7 (8). Forms triangle <4, 7, 8>.
13. (4, 9): Shares connection with node 5 (9). Does not form a triangle.
14. (5, 1): Already counted in (1, 5).
15. (5, 9): Shares no connections.
16. (7, 0): Already counted in (0, 7).
17. (7, 2): Already counted in (2, 7).
18. (7, 3): Already counted in (3, 7).
19. (7, 8): Already counted in (4, 8).
20. (7, 9): Shares no connections.
21. (8, 3): Shares no connections.
22. (8, 4): Already counted in (4, 8).
23. (8, 7): Already counted in (4, 8).
24. (9, 4): Already counted in (4, 8).
25. (9, 5): Shares no connections.
26. (9, 7): Shares no connections.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <4, 7, 8>.
