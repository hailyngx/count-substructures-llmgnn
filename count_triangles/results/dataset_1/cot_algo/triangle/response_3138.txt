Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 6 has degree 0 connections.
Node 4 has degree 1 connections.
Nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9 have degree 1 connections.
Nodes 1 and 5 have degree 2 connections.
Node 0 has degree 3 connections.
Node 7 has degree 8 connections.

Next, we relabel the vertices accordingly:

Node 6 (degree 0) -> Node 0 (new label: 0)
Node 4 (degree 1) -> Node 1 (new label: 1)
Nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9 (degree 1) -> Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5 (new labels: 2, 3, 4, 5)
Nodes 1 and 5 (degree 2) -> Nodes 6 and 7 (new labels: 6, 7)
Node 0 (degree 3) -> Node 8 (new label: 8)
Node 7 (degree 8) -> Node 9 (new label: 9)

Now, we can check for triangles formed by the edges based on the new labels. 
Let's list the triangles found:

<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<0, 5, 7>

Counting the unique triangles, we find there are [3] triangles present in the given graph.
