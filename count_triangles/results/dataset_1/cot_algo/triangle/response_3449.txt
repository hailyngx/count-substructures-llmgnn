Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degree:
Nodes: [0, 2, 7, 9, 3, 4, 6, 8, 5, 1]

The triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method are:
[<0, 1, 4> <1, 5, 8> <5, 7, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is:
[3]
