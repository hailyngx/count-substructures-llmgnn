Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling the vertices accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices with their degrees is as follows:
(0: 2), (1: 2), (5: 1), (2: 2), (6: 1), (3: 2), (9: 1), (7: 5), (8: 6)

Now, we will go through each edge and only consider the cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

For the given graph, the triangles formed are as follows:
[10]
<0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
