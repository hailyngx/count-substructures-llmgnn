Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to the given graph: 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Vertex 0 - connections: 1
Vertex 9 - connections: 2
Vertex 5 - connections: 3
Vertex 6 - connections: 3
Vertex 4 - connections: 3
Vertex 3 - connections: 3
Vertex 2 - connections: 4
Vertex 8 - connections: 4
Vertex 7 - connections: 5
Vertex 1 - connections: 8

Based on this ordering, we will analyze the edges:
(0, 1) - proceed
Shared connections with 1: none

(1, 0) - skip (already counted)

(1, 2) - proceed
Shared connections with 2: none

(1, 3) - proceed
Shared connections with 3: none

(1, 4) - proceed
Shared connections with 4: none

(1, 5) - proceed
Shared connections with 5: none

(1, 6) - proceed
Shared connections with 6: none

(1, 8) - proceed
Shared connections with 8: none

(2, 1) - skip (already counted)

(2, 3) - proceed
Shared connections with 3: none

(2, 4) - proceed
Shared connections with 4: none

(2, 6) - proceed
Shared connections with 6: none

(2, 7) - proceed
Shared connections with 7: none

(3, 1) - skip (already counted)

(3, 2) - skip (already counted)

(3, 5) - proceed
Shared connections with 5: 1

(4, 1) - skip (already counted)

(4, 2) - skip (already counted)

(5, 1) - skip (already counted)

(5, 3) - skip (already counted)

(5, 7) - proceed
Shared connections with 7: 1

(6, 1) - skip (already counted)

(6, 2) - skip (already counted)

(7, 2) - skip (already counted)

(7, 5) - skip (already counted)

(7, 8) - proceed
Shared connections with 8: 1

(7, 9) - proceed
Shared connections with 9: 8

(8, 1) - skip (already counted)

(8, 7) - skip (already counted)

(8, 9) - skip (already counted)

(9, 7) - skip (already counted)

(9, 8) - skip (already counted)

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 5, 7>
