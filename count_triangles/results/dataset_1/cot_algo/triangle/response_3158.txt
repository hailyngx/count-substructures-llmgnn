Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the nodes are:  
Node 5 is connected to nodes: 0  
Node 4 is connected to nodes: 6  
Node 3 is connected to nodes: 7, 8  
Node 1 is connected to nodes: 0, 8, 9  
Node 2 is connected to nodes: 7, 8, 9  
Node 0 is connected to nodes: 5, 8, 9  
Node 8 is connected to nodes: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9  
Node 9 is connected to nodes: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8  
Node 7 is connected to nodes: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9  
Node 6 is connected to nodes: 4, 7, 8, 9  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- The edges to consider are: (0, 5), (4, 6), (3, 7), (7, 2), (6, 4), (8, 0), (9, 0)
- The triangles formed by the above edges are:  
<0, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<8, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
