Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for nodes are:
- Node 4: 0 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections
- Node 2: 6 connections
- Node 3: 6 connections
- Node 7: 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 8), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)

Now, we will count the number of triangles formed by these edges:

Total number of triangles: [72]

Unique triangles:
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
