Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on the number of their connections:

Vertices with the least connections:
Node 1: 1 edge (connected to 3)
Node 2: 1 edge (connected to 3)
Node 5: 2 edges (connected to 8, 9)
Node 7: 2 edges (connected to 0, 6)

Vertices with more connections:
Node 0: 3 edges (connected to 3, 4, 7)
Node 4: 3 edges (connected to 0, 3, 6)

Vertices with the most connections:
Node 3: 7 edges (connected to 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9)
Node 6: 4 edges (connected to 1, 3, 4, 7)
Node 8: 4 edges (connected to 2, 3, 5, 9)
Node 9: 4 edges (connected to 3, 5, 8)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles:

1. Triangle: <3, 0, 4>
2. Triangle: <3, 0, 7>
3. Triangle: <3, 4, 6>
4. Triangle: <3, 6, 1>
5. Triangle: <3, 6, 7>
6. Triangle: <3, 8, 2>
7. Triangle: <3, 8, 5>
8. Triangle: <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
