Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree of connectivity in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are: <4, 7, 6, 3, 1, 2, 0, 8, 5, 9>.

Now, we will traverse each edge and count the total number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [12].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 9, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 0>
<8, 9, 2>
<8, 9, 3>
