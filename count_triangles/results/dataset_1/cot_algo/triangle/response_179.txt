Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 3, 2, 6, 7, 8, 0, 4, 5, 9, 1

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (0, 1) is not considered.
- Edge (0, 4) forms triangle <0, 4, 5>.
- Edge (0, 5) forms triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- Edge (0, 6) forms triangle <0, 6, 4>.
- Edge (0, 7) is not considered.
- Edge (1, 5) is not considered.
- Edge (1, 8) is not considered.
- Edge (1, 9) forms triangle <1, 9, 6>.
- Edge (3, 4) is not considered.
- Edge (3, 5) is not considered.
- Edge (4, 6) forms triangle <4, 6, 7>.
- Edge (4, 7) forms triangle <4, 7, 0>.
- Edge (5, 6) is not considered.
- Edge (5, 7) forms triangle <5, 7, 0>.
- Edge (5, 8) forms triangle <5, 8, 1>.
- Edge (6, 7) forms triangle <6, 7, 0>.
- Edge (6, 9) forms triangle <6, 9, 1>.
- Edge (7, 8) is not considered.
- Edge (8, 9) is not considered.

Count of triangles: [7] 
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 4>, <1, 9, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 0>, <5, 7, 0>
