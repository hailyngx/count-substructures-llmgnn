Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we first need to sort the vertices by their degree.
The degrees are:  
- Vertex 0: degree 2  
- Vertex 1: degree 3  
- Vertex 2: degree 2  
- Vertex 3: degree 7  
- Vertex 4: degree 2  
- Vertex 5: degree 6  
- Vertex 6: degree 3  
- Vertex 7: degree 3  
- Vertex 8: degree 2  
- Vertex 9: degree 4  

Next, we relabel the vertices accordingly as follows:  
- Vertex 0 (degree 2): new label 0  
- Vertex 1 (degree 3): new label 1  
- Vertex 2 (degree 2): new label 2  
- Vertex 3 (degree 7): new label 3  
- Vertex 4 (degree 2): new label 4  
- Vertex 5 (degree 6): new label 5  
- Vertex 6 (degree 3): new label 6  
- Vertex 7 (degree 3): new label 7  
- Vertex 8 (degree 2): new label 8  
- Vertex 9 (degree 4): new label 9

Now, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
The valid edges to consider are:  
- (0, 5)  
- (0, 6)  
- (1, 3)  
- (1, 4)  
- (2, 3)  
- (3, 4)  
- (3, 8)  
- (4, 7)  
- (5, 6)  
- (5, 8)  

By checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we find the following unique triangles:  
<0, 5, 6>  
<1, 3, 4>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
