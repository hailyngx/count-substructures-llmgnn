Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
0 -> 1 connections
1 -> 2 connections
5 -> 2 connections
7 -> 2 connections
4 -> 3 connections
6 -> 3 connections
8 -> 3 connections
3 -> 4 connections
9 -> 4 connections
2 -> 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph:

Triangles: [<2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 4>, <3, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [6]
