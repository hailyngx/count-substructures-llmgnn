Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertices sorted by number of connections: 
1. Node 6 (degree 1)
2. Node 7 (degree 1)
3. Node 8 (degree 1)
4. Node 9 (degree 2)
5. Node 1 (degree 2)
6. Node 5 (degree 2)
7. Node 0 (degree 3)
8. Node 3 (degree 3)
9. Node 6 (degree 3)
10. Node 2 (degree 6)

Triangles found: 
[8] 

Triangles: <0, 2, 4>
