Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0 has 2 connections
- Vertex 1 has 4 connections
- Vertex 2 has 4 connections
- Vertex 3 has 3 connections
- Vertex 4 has 5 connections
- Vertex 5 has 3 connections
- Vertex 6 has 6 connections
- Vertex 7 has 5 connections
- Vertex 8 has 4 connections
- Vertex 9 has 2 connections

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most:
- Vertex 0 (2 connections) is relabeled as vertex 4
- Vertex 1 (4 connections) is relabeled as vertex 0
- Vertex 2 (4 connections) is relabeled as vertex 1
- Vertex 3 (3 connections) is relabeled as vertex 2
- Vertex 4 (5 connections) is relabeled as vertex 6
- Vertex 5 (3 connections) is relabeled as vertex 3
- Vertex 6 (6 connections) is relabeled as vertex 7
- Vertex 7 (5 connections) is relabeled as vertex 5
- Vertex 8 (4 connections) is relabeled as vertex 8
- Vertex 9 (2 connections) is relabeled as vertex 9

Now, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 6) won't form a triangle as vertex 0 (label 0) has more connections than vertex 6 (label 7).
- Edge (1, 2) will form a triangle: <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (1, 4) won't form a triangle due to the higher label having more connections.
- Edge (1, 5) won't form a triangle due to the higher label having more connections.
- Edge (1, 6) won't form a triangle due to the higher label having more connections.
- Edge (2, 3) won't form a triangle as vertex 2 (label 1) has more connections than vertex 3 (label 2).
- Edge (2, 4) won't form a triangle due to the higher label having more connections.
- Edge (3, 4) will form a triangle: <1, 2, 4>.
- Edge (3, 8) won't form a triangle as vertex 3 (label 2) has more connections than vertex 8 (label 8).
- Edge (4, 7) won't form a triangle as vertex 4 (label 6) has more connections than vertex 7 (label 5).
- Edge (5, 7) won't form a triangle due to the higher label having more connections.
- Edge (6, 0) won't form a triangle as vertex 6 (label 7) has more connections than vertex 0 (label 4).
- Edge (6, 1) won't form a triangle as vertex 6 (label 7) has more connections than vertex 1 (label 0).
- Edge (6, 2) won't form a triangle as vertex 6 (label 7) has more connections than vertex 2 (label 1).
- Edge (6, 4) won't form a triangle due to the higher label having more connections.
- Edge (6, 7) won't form a triangle as vertex 6 (label 7) has more connections than vertex 7 (label 5).
- Edge (6, 9) won't form a triangle due to the higher label having more connections.
- Edge (7, 8) won't form a triangle as vertex 7 (label 5) has more connections than vertex 8 (label 8).
- Edge (8, 5) won't form a triangle as vertex 8 (label 8) has more connections than vertex 5 (label 3).
- Edge (9, 6) won't form a triangle due to the higher label having more connections.
- Edge (9, 7) won't form a triangle due to the higher label having more connections.

The total number of triangles inside brackets is [2].
