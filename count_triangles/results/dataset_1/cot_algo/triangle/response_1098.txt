Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we determine the degree of each node:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 1
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 1
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 6
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 3

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 1: degree 1
Node 3: degree 1
Node 0: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 7: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we'll now count the number of triangles formed:
Triangles: 
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
