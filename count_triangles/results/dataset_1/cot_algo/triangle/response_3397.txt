Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted vertices are: 3, 9, 0, 5, 7, 4, 1, 2, 8, 6.

We will now count the triangles by examining each edge:

1. Edge (0, 4): Both 0 and 4 have 2 connections. Check for shared connections: 5. Formed triangle: <0, 4, 5>.

2. Edge (0, 8): Both 0 and 8 have 2 connections. Check for shared connections: 7. No triangle is formed.

3. Edge (1, 2): Both 1 and 2 have 2 connections. Check for shared connections: None. No triangle is formed.

4. Edge (1, 7): Both 1 and 7 have 2 connections. Check for shared connections: None. No triangle is formed.

5. Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 has 2 connections and Vertex 6 has 3 connections. Proceed. Check for shared connections: 1. Formed triangle: <2, 6, 1>.

6. Edge (4, 0): Already counted in the first step.

7. Edge (4, 5): Both 4 and 5 have 2 connections. Check for shared connections: 6. Formed triangle: <4, 5, 6>.

8. Edge (5, 4): Already counted in the seventh step.

9. Edge (5, 6): Already counted in the seventh step.

10. Edge (6, 2): Already counted in the fifth step.

11. Edge (6, 5): Already counted in the seventh step.

12. Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 has 3 connections and Vertex 9 has 1 connection. Proceed. Check for shared connections: None. No triangle is formed.

13. Edge (7, 1): Already counted in the fourth step.

14. Edge (7, 8): Both 7 and 8 have 2 connections. Check for shared connections: 0. No triangle is formed.

15. Edge (8, 0): Already counted in the second step.

16. Edge (8, 7): Already counted in the fourteenth step.

17. Edge (9, 6): Already counted in the twelfth step.

After examining all edges, we found the following triangles: <0, 4, 5> and <2, 6, 1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
