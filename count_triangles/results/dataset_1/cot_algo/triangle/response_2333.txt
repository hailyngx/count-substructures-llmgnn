Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 2: Degree 0
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 3

Now, we will go through each edge based on the ordering and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 7): Forms a triangle with node 1: <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (0, 9): Forms a triangle with node 1: <0, 1, 9>
- Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 7): Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (1, 8): Forms a triangle with node 9: <1, 8, 9>
- Edge (1, 9): Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 1, 9>
- Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 6): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 4, 7>
- Edge (5, 1): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (5, 3): No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 4): No triangles formed
- Edge (6, 3): No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 0): Forms a triangle with node 1: <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (7, 1): Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (7, 4): Forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 4, 7>
- Edge (8, 1): Forms a triangle with node 9: <1, 8, 9>
- Edge (8, 3): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 9): Forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 8, 9>
- Edge (9, 0): Forms a triangle with node 1: <0, 1, 9>
- Edge (9, 1): Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 1, 9>
- Edge (9, 8): Forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 8, 9>

Count of triangles: [10]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 8, 9>, <0, 1, 5>
