Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 8, 5, 6, 4, 1, 6, 3, 7, 0, 4.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Counting the triangles formed by these edges, we find:
- Triangle <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle <0, 2, 7>
- Triangle <1, 3, 4>
- Triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
