Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by connections:
1. Vertex 6 (degree 2)
2. Vertex 9 (degree 2)
3. Vertex 5 (degree 3)
4. Vertex 1 (degree 3)
5. Vertex 4 (degree 4)
6. Vertex 2 (degree 4)
7. Vertex 8 (degree 4)
8. Vertex 3 (degree 5)
9. Vertex 0 (degree 6)
10. Vertex 7 (degree 6)

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges in order:

1. Edge (0, 3): Forms triangles with shared connections 2, 7. Triangle <0, 2, 3>.
2. Edge (0, 4): Forms triangles with shared connections 2, 7. Triangle <0, 2, 4>.
3. Edge (0, 7): Forms triangles with shared connections 6, 8, 9. Triangles <0, 6, 7> and <0, 8, 7> and <0, 9, 7>.
4. Edge (0, 8): No new triangles.
5. Edge (1, 2): No new triangles.
6. Edge (1, 5): No new triangles.
7. Edge (1, 9): No new triangles.
8. Edge (2, 3): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0. Triangle <0, 2, 3>.
9. Edge (2, 4): Forms triangles with shared connections 0, 7. Triangles <0, 2, 4> and <2, 4, 7>.
10. Edge (3, 6): No new triangles.
11. Edge (3, 7): Forms triangles with shared connections 0, 4. Triangles <0, 3, 4> and <3, 4, 7>.
12. Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3. Triangle <3, 4, 7>.
13. Edge (5, 7): No new triangles.
14. Edge (5, 8): No new triangles.
15. Edge (6, 8): No new triangles.
16. Edge (7, 9): No new triangles.

Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 9, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <0, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 7>, <0, 3, 4>.
