Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labeling of vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 6, 1, 2, 5, 9, 3, 0, 7, 8, 4

Now, let's count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (6, 1) - Vertex 6 has 1 connection and vertex 1 has 3 connections. No triangle.
2. Edge (1, 2) - Vertex 1 has 3 connections and vertex 2 has 3 connections. No triangle.
3. Edge (2, 5) - Vertex 2 has 3 connections and vertex 5 has 4 connections. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>.
4. Edge (5, 9) - Vertex 5 has 4 connections and vertex 9 has 4 connections. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 8>.
5. Edge (9, 3) - Vertex 9 has 4 connections and vertex 3 has 4 connections. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 8>.
6. Edge (3, 0) - Vertex 3 has 4 connections and vertex 0 has 4 connections. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>.
7. Edge (0, 7) - Vertex 0 has 4 connections and vertex 7 has 4 connections. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>.
8. Edge (7, 8) - Vertex 7 has 4 connections and vertex 8 has 4 connections. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles found: <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <0, 4, 7>
