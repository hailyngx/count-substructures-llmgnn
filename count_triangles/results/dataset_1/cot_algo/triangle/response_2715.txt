Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have:
Nodes with their respective connections:
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 8: 6 connections
- Node 7: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (1, 2) is skipped since both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (3, 4) is skipped since both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (5, 9) is considered.
  - Node 5 shares connections with nodes 0 and 8. So, the triangle <5, 0, 8> is found.
- Edge (7, 2) is considered.
  - Node 7 shares a connection with node 2. So, the triangle <7, 2, 1> is found.
- Edge (7, 3) is considered.
  - Node 7 shares connections with nodes 2 and 4. So, the triangle <7, 3, 4> is found.
- Edge (7, 4) is considered.
  - Node 7 shares connections with nodes 2 and 3. So, the triangle <7, 4, 3> is found.
- Edge (7, 6) is considered.
  - Node 7 shares connections with nodes 2 and 3. So, the triangle <7, 6, 3> is found.
- Edge (7, 8) is considered.
  - Node 7 shares connections with nodes 4 and 6. So, the triangle <7, 8, 6> is found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6], and the unique triangles found are <5, 0, 8>, <7, 2, 1>, <7, 3, 4>, <7, 4, 3>, <7, 6, 3>, and <7, 8, 6>.
