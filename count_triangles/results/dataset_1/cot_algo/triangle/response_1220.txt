Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most:
Vertex 2: 0 connections
Vertex 4: 0 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections

Triangles found:
