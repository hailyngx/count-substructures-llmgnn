Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will assign labels to the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 1
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 1
Node 9: degree 1

Now, we will sort the nodes by their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes: 6, 8, 9, 5, 2, 7, 1, 4, 0, 3

Next, we will count the triangles by examining each edge in the graph:

For edge (0, 4):
Both 0 and 4 have degree 3, proceeding...
Shared connections: 1 (node 3)
Triangle found: <0, 3, 4>

For edge (0, 5):
Both 0 and 5 have degree 2, proceeding...
No triangle found since there are no shared connections between 0 and 5.

For edge (0, 7):
Node 0 (degree 4) has more connections than node 7 (degree 2), skipping.

For edge (0, 9):
Node 0 (degree 4) has more connections than node 9 (degree 1), skipping.

For edge (1, 2):
Node 1 (degree 3) has more connections than node 2 (degree 2), skipping.

For edge (1, 3):
Both 1 and 3 have degree 4, proceeding...
Shared connections: 0 (node 4), 5 (node 5)
Triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 4>

For edge (1, 7):
Node 1 (degree 3) has more connections than node 7 (degree 2), skipping.

For edge (2, 1):
Node 2 (degree 2) has fewer connections than node 1 (degree 3), proceeding...
Shared connections: None, no triangle found.

For edge (2, 8):
Node 2 (degree 2) has fewer connections than node 8 (degree 1), proceeding...
Shared connections: None, no triangle found.

For edge (3, 1):
Already counted in the edge (1, 3).

For edge (3, 4):
Already counted in the edge (0, 4).

For edge (3, 5):
Already counted in the edge (0, 5).

For edge (3, 6):
Node 3 (degree 4) has more connections than node 6 (degree 1), skipping.

For edge (4, 0):
Already counted in the edge (0, 4).

For edge (4, 3):
Already counted in the edge (0, 4).

For edge (5, 0):
Already counted in the edge (0, 5).

For edge (5, 3):
Already counted in the edge (0, 5).

For edge (6, 3):
Already counted in the edge (3, 6).

For edge (7, 0):
Already counted in the edge (0, 7).

For edge (7, 1):
Already counted in the edge (1, 7).

For edge (8, 2):
Already counted in the edge (2, 8).

For edge (9, 0):
Already counted in the edge (0, 9).
