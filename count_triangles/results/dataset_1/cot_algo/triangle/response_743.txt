Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices: 0 (degree 3), 1 (degree 2), 2 (degree 1), 3 (degree 2), 4 (degree 2), 5 (degree 1), 6 (degree 1), 7 (degree 4), 8 (degree 3), 9 (degree 3)

Now, we relabel the vertices in increasing order of their degrees:
0 -> 2
1 -> 5
2 -> 6
3 -> 0
4 -> 1
5 -> 3
6 -> 4
7 -> 8
8 -> 9
9 -> 7

Now, we check each edge and count the triangles formed:

(0, 2):
No triangles formed.

(0, 4):
Triangles: <2, 0, 4>

(0, 5):
No triangles formed.

(1, 7):
No triangles formed.

(1, 8):
Triangles: <5, 1, 8>

(2, 0):
No triangles formed.

(3, 7):
No triangles formed.

(3, 9):
No triangles formed.

(4, 0):
Triangles: <2, 0, 4>

(4, 8):
No triangles formed.

(5, 0):
No triangles formed.

(6, 7):
No triangles formed.

(7, 1):
No triangles formed.

(7, 3):
No triangles formed.

(7, 6):
No triangles formed.

(8, 1):
Triangles: <5, 1, 8>

(8, 4):
No triangles formed.

(8, 9):
Triangles: <5, 8, 9>

(9, 3):
No triangles formed.

(9, 8):
Triangles: <5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
<2, 0, 4>
<5, 1, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
