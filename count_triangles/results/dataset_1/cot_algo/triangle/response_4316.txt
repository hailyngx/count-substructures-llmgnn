Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices by degree:
0: 2
1: 0
2: 3
3: 2
4: 3
5: 2
6: 2
7: 1
8: 1
9: 4

Sorted vertices:
1 -> 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
(0, 2):
- Shared connections with 0: [2, 7]
- Shared connections with 2: [3, 5]
- Triangle: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>

(0, 7):
No triangles.

(2, 3):
- Shared connections with 2: [0, 5]
- Shared connections with 3: [9]
- Triangle: <2, 3, 9>

(2, 5):
- Shared connections with 2: [0, 3, 4]
- Shared connections with 5: [4]
- Triangle: <2, 5, 4>

(3, 9):
- Shared connections with 3: [2]
- Shared connections with 9: [4, 6]
- Triangle: <3, 9, 4>

(4, 5):
- Shared connections with 4: [9]
- Shared connections with 5: [2]
- Triangle: <4, 5, 2>

(4, 9):
- Shared connections with 4: [5]
- Shared connections with 9: [3, 6]
- Triangle: <4, 9, 3>

(9, 6):
- Shared connections with 9: [3]
- Shared connections with 6: []
- No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 4>, <3, 9, 4>, <4, 5, 2>
