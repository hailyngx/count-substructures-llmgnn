Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for finding triangles in the given graph is as follows:

The degrees of each node:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4

Ordering the nodes by degrees:
Nodes in order: 5, 4, 1, 2, 8, 0, 3, 9, 7, 6

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
