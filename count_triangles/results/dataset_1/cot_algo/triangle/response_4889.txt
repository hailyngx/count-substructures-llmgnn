Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connections, the new ordering is: 1, 0, 4, 6, 9, 8, 5, 3, 7, 2.

Using this ordering and following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles: 
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 3>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
