Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are: 
2, 7, 3, 6, 1, 4, 0, 5, 8, 9.

Now, we will find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The total number of triangles is [22].
The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 5, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<0, 8, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 2>
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 6, 5>
<5, 4, 8>
<5, 9, 0>
<5, 9, 8>
<5, 0, 9>
