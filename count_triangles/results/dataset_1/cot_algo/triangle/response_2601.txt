Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for this graph is as follows:

Node 6, 5, 7, 2, 5, 0, 8, 9, 1, 4

Based on this ordering, we will analyze the edges:

1. Edge (0, 1) - Node 0 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 4. Node 1 has connections with nodes 3, 7, 8, 9. Shared connection: 3 forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.

2. Edge (0, 2) - Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 4. Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 4. Shared connection: 3 forming a triangle <0, 2, 3>.

3. Edge (0, 3) - Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 2, 4. Node 3 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5. Shared connection: 1, 2, 4 forming triangles <0, 3, 1> and <0, 3, 2> and <0, 3, 4>.

4. Edge (0, 4) - Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 2, 3. Node 4 has connections with nodes 7, 8, 1, 2, 3. Shared connection: 1, 2, 3 forming triangles <0, 4, 1> and <0, 4, 2> and <0, 4, 3>.

19. Edge (4, 2) - This edge is already considered in edge (0, 4).

20. Edge (4, 3) - This edge is already considered in edge (0, 3).

21. Edge (4, 7) - This edge is already considered in edge (1, 7).

22. Edge (4, 8) - This edge is already considered in edge (1, 8).

23. Edge (5, 3) - This edge is already considered in edge (3, 5).

24. Edge (5, 9) - This edge is already considered in edge (3, 5).

25. Edge (6, 7) - Node 6 has connections with nodes 8, 9, 7. Node 7 has connections with nodes 1, 4, 6. Shared connection: 7 forming a triangle <6, 7, 4>.

Based on the analysis, we can see that the unique triangles in this graph are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 3>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 8, 4>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 9, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 4>, <6, 8, 4>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [17].
