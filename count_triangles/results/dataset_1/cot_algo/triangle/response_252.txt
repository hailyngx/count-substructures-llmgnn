Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices: 
0 (degree 1)
1 (degree 2)
2 (degree 1)
3 (degree 3)
4 (degree 1)
5 (degree 1)
6 (degree 1)
7 (degree 2)
8 (degree 3)
  
Sorted vertices:
0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7, 3, 8

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will now process the edges:

1. Edge (0, 1): Both vertices have higher degrees, ignore.
2. Edge (1, 7): Both vertices have higher degrees, ignore.
3. Edge (2, 6): Both vertices have higher degrees, ignore.
4. Edge (3, 4): Vertex 4 has lower degree, proceed.
   Check for shared connections with vertex 3: Shared connection with vertex 5.
5. Edge (3, 5): Vertex 5 has lower degree, proceed.
   Check for shared connections with vertex 3: Shared connections with vertices 4, 8.
6. Edge (3, 8): Vertex 8 has lower degree, proceed.
   Check for shared connections with vertex 3: Shared connections with vertices 5, 7.
7. Edge (7, 8): Vertex 8 has lower degree, proceed.
   Check for shared connections with vertex 7: Shared connection with vertex 1.

Based on the above process, the total number of triangles is [1] and the unique triangles found are <3, 4, 5>.
