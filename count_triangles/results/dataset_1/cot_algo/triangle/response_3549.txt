Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is: 
Vertex 4 - Degree 0
Vertex 5 - Degree 1
Vertex 0 - Degree 2
Vertex 2 - Degree 2
Vertex 3 - Degree 2
Vertex 6 - Degree 3
Vertex 1 - Degree 4
Vertex 8 - Degree 5
Vertex 7 - Degree 5
Vertex 9 - Degree 7

Using the degree-based ordering method:

Examining edge (0, 8): Vertices 0 and 8 have 2 shared connections (9 and 1) forming triangle <0, 1, 8>.
Examining edge (0, 9): Vertices 0 and 9 have 1 shared connection (8) forming triangle <0, 8, 9>.
Examining edge (1, 3): Vertices 1 and 3 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (1, 5): Vertices 1 and 5 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (1, 7): Vertices 1 and 7 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (1, 8): Vertices 1 and 8 have 1 shared connection (0) forming triangle <0, 1, 8>.
Examining edge (2, 6): Vertices 2 and 6 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (2, 9): Vertices 2 and 9 have 1 shared connection (6) forming triangle <2, 6, 9>.
Examining edge (3, 1): Vertices 1 and 3 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (3, 9): Vertices 3 and 9 have 1 shared connection (1) forming triangle <1, 3, 9>.
Examining edge (4, 8): Vertices 4 and 8 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (5, 1): Vertices 1 and 5 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (5, 6): Vertices 5 and 6 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (6, 2): Vertices 2 and 6 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (6, 5): Vertices 5 and 6 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (6, 7): Vertices 6 and 7 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (7, 1): Vertices 1 and 7 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (7, 6): Vertices 6 and 7 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (7, 9): Vertices 7 and 9 have 3 shared connections (1, 6, 8) forming triangle <1, 6, 7>.
Examining edge (8, 0): Vertices 0 and 8 have 2 shared connections (9 and 1) forming triangle <0, 1, 8>.
Examining edge (8, 1): Vertices 1 and 8 have 1 shared connection (0) forming triangle <0, 1, 8>.
Examining edge (8, 4): Vertices 4 and 8 have 0 shared connections, no triangle formed.
Examining edge (8, 9): Vertices 8 and 9 have 2 shared connections (0 and 1) forming triangle <0, 8, 9>.
Examining edge (9, 0): Vertices 0 and 9 have 1 shared connection (8) forming triangle <0, 8, 9>.
Examining edge (9, 2): Vertices 2 and 9 have 1 shared connection (6) forming triangle <2, 6, 9>.
Examining edge (9, 3): Vertices 3 and 9 have 1 shared connection (1) forming triangle <1, 3, 9>.
Examining edge (9, 7): Vertices 7 and 9 have 3 shared connections (1, 6, 8) forming triangle <1, 6, 7>.
Examining edge (9, 8): Vertices 8 and 9 have 2 shared connections (0 and 1) forming triangle <0, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
