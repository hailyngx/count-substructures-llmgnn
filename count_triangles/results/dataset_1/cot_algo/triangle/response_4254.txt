Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help us in finding the number of triangles in the graph. 

First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 3

We rearrange the node labels based on their degrees:
Node 1: 1
Node 2: 2
Node 7: 3
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 5
Node 6: 6
Node 9: 7
Node 0: 8
Node 3: 9
Node 8: 10

Now, let's go through the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:

(1, 8): No triangles
(2, 3): No triangles
(3, 6): No triangles
(4, 8): No triangles
(5, 8): No triangles
(6, 7): No triangles
(9, 5): Triangle <3, 5, 9>
(5, 0): No triangles
(3, 0): No triangles

Counting the triangles found: [1]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 1, and the unique triangle found is <3, 5, 9>.
