Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeling:
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and examining the edges, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle <0, 4, 3>
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <2, 8, 5>
- Triangle <5, 7, 8>
- Triangle <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
