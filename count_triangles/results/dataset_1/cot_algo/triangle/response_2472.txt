Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0 - 2 connections
Node 3 - 1 connection
Node 4 - 1 connection
Node 7 - 1 connection
Node 9 - 1 connection
Node 2 - 2 connections
Node 8 - 0 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 5 - 4 connections
Node 6 - 5 connections

After sorting the vertices, we relabel them:
0 - 0
3 - 1
4 - 2
7 - 3
9 - 4
2 - 5
8 - 6
1 - 7
5 - 8
6 - 9

Now, we analyze the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 6): Both have 2 connections, so no triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 2): Node 1 has 4 connections, Node 2 has 2 connections. They share Node 5, forming a triangle <1, 2, 5>.
- Edge (1, 5): Node 1 has 4 connections, Node 5 has 4 connections. They share Node 8, forming a triangle <1, 5, 8>.
- Edge (1, 9): Both have 4 connections, so no triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 4): Node 2 has 2 connections, Node 4 has 1 connection. They share Node 5, forming a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
- Edge (3, 5): Node 3 has 1 connection, Node 5 has 4 connections. No triangle formed as Node 3 lacks connections for a triangle.
- Edge (4, 2): Node 4 has 1 connection, Node 2 has 2 connections. They share Node 5, forming a triangle <4, 2, 5>.
- Edge (5, 1): Already counted in the triangle <1, 2, 5>.
- Edge (5, 3): Already counted in the triangle <3, 5, 8>.
- Edge (5, 6): Node 5 has 4 connections, Node 6 has 5 connections. They share Node 8, forming a triangle <5, 6, 8>.
- Edge (6, 0): Already counted in the triangle <0, 6, 9>.
- Edge (6, 5): Already counted in the triangle <5, 6, 8>.
- Edge (6, 7): Node 6 has 5 connections, Node 7 has 1 connection. They share Node 5, forming a triangle <6, 7, 5>.
- Edge (7, 6): Already counted in the triangle <6, 7, 5>.
- Edge (9, 1): Already counted in the triangle <1, 5, 8>.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [4] as we found 4 unique triangles: <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, and <5, 6, 8>.
