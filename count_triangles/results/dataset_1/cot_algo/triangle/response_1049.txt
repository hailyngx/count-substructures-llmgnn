Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 3 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 4 connections
- Vertex 9: 1 connection

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will relabel the vertices as follows:
- Vertex 4 (1 connection) -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 2, 3, 6, 9 (2 connections) -> Vertex 1, 2, 3, 4
- Vertex 0, 1 (3 connections) -> Vertex 5, 6
- Vertex 5, 7, 8 (4 connections) -> Vertex 7, 8, 9

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the relabeled vertices:
- Edge (0, 3): Both vertices have 2 connections (Vertex 1), forming a triangle with Vertex 4.
- Edge (0, 8): Both vertices have 4 connections (Vertex 7), forming a triangle with Vertex 9.
- Edge (1, 5): Both vertices have 3 connections (Vertex 6), forming a triangle with Vertex 7.
- Edge (1, 6): Both vertices have 2 connections (Vertex 3), forming a triangle with Vertex 4.
- Edge (2, 5): Both vertices have 4 connections (Vertex 7), forming a triangle with Vertex 8.
- Edge (3, 4): Both vertices have 1 connection (Vertex 0), forming a triangle with Vertex 2.
- Edge (5, 1): Both vertices have 3 connections (Vertex 6), forming a triangle with Vertex 7.
- Edge (5, 2): Both vertices have 4 connections (Vertex 8), forming a triangle with Vertex 9.
- Edge (5, 8): Both vertices have 4 connections (Vertex 8), forming a triangle with Vertex 9.
- Edge (6, 1): Both vertices have 2 connections (Vertex 3), forming a triangle with Vertex 4.
- Edge (6, 7): Both vertices have 4 connections (Vertex 8), forming a triangle with Vertex 9.
- Edge (7, 6): Both vertices have 2 connections (Vertex 3), forming a triangle with Vertex 4.
- Edge (7, 8): Both vertices have 4 connections (Vertex 9), forming a triangle with Vertex 8.
- Edge (7, 9): Both vertices have 4 connections (Vertex 8), forming a triangle with Vertex 9.

Counting the total number of triangles, we find [9] triangles in total, and the unique triangles are <1, 3, 4>, <0, 1, 2>, <2, 5, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 7>, <6, 1, 4>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.
