Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting the triangles efficiently.

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections:
0 (degree 5)
1 (degree 4)
3 (degree 4)
5 (degree 6)
2 (degree 1)
4 (degree 2)
6 (degree 2)
7 (degree 1)
8 (degree 2)
9 (degree 3)

Now, let's analyze each edge based on the ordering:

Edge (0, 1): Both vertices have fewer connections than the other, forming a triangle with the shared connection 3. This forms the triangle <0, 1, 3>.
Edge (0, 3): Both vertices have the same number of connections, so there is no triangle formed.
Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 4, so we skip this edge for triangle counting.
Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 6, so we skip this edge for triangle counting.
Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 9, so we skip this edge for triangle counting.
Edge (1, 3): Both vertices have fewer connections than the other, forming a triangle with the shared connection 0. This forms the triangle <1, 3, 0>.
Edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 6, so we skip this edge for triangle counting.
Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 8, so we skip this edge for triangle counting.
Edge (2, 5): Both vertices have fewer connections than the other, forming a triangle with the shared connection 3. This forms the triangle <2, 5, 3>.
Edge (3, 5): Both vertices have the same number of connections, so there is no triangle formed.
Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 9, so we skip this edge for triangle counting.
Edge (4, 5): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 5, forming a triangle with the shared connection 0. This forms the triangle <4, 5, 0>.
Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 7, so we skip this edge for triangle counting.
Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 8, so we skip this edge for triangle counting.
Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 9, so we skip this edge for triangle counting.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 0>, <2, 5, 3>.
