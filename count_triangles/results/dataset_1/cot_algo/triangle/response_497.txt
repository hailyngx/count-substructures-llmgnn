Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 4

Next, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 0 -> Node 1
Node 1 -> Node 2
Node 2 -> Node 3
Node 3 -> Node 4
Node 4 -> Node 5
Node 5 -> Node 6
Node 6 -> Node 7
Node 7 -> Node 8
Node 8 -> Node 9
Node 9 -> Node 10

Now, we will count the number of triangles based on the sorted and relabeled nodes:

Triangles: 2
Triangles: <0, 5, 9> <br/>
Triangles: [2]
