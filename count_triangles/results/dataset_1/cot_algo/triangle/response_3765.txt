Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 3 has 0 connections.
Node 1 has 1 connection.
Node 3 has 1 connection.
Node 6 has 2 connections.
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.

Following the method, we count the number of triangles:

- Edge (0, 5): shared connections with 2, 4
- Edge (0, 7): shared connections with 5
- Edge (1, 4): shared connections with 5
- Edge (2, 5): shared connections with 0, 4
- Edge (2, 7): shared connections with 0
- Edge (4, 1): shared connections with 5
- Edge (4, 5): shared connections with 0, 2
- Edge (4, 8): shared connections with 6
- Edge (5, 6): shared connections with 4
- Edge (6, 8): shared connections with 4
- Edge (7, 0): shared connections with 5
- Edge (7, 2): shared connections with 0
- Edge (7, 9): shared connections with 8
- Edge (8, 4): shared connections with 6
- Edge (8, 6): shared connections with 4
- Edge (8, 9): shared connections with 4
- Edge (9, 7): shared connections with 8

Total number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles:
- <0, 5, 4>
- <0, 5, 2>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <6, 8, 4>
- <7, 9, 8>
- <2, 0, 7>
