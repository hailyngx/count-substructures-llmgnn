Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2

Now, we need to relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 3 (degree 1) becomes Node 0
- Node 7 (degree 1) becomes Node 1
- Node 1 (degree 2) becomes Node 2
- Node 4 (degree 2) becomes Node 3
- Node 6 (degree 2) becomes Node 4
- Node 8 (degree 2) becomes Node 5
- Node 9 (degree 2) becomes Node 6
- Node 2 (degree 3) becomes Node 7
- Node 5 (degree 4) becomes Node 8
- Node 0 (degree 4) becomes Node 9

Now, we need to examine each edge based on our relabeled nodes:

- Edge (3, 7): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (7, 1): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (1, 2): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (2, 3): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (3, 4): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (4, 5): Shared connection with Node 0, so triangle <3, 4, 0> is found
- Edge (5, 5): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (5, 3): Shared connection with Node 0, so triangle <5, 3, 0> is found
- Edge (0, 9): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (9, 6): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (6, 6): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (6, 1): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (1, 8): Shared connection with Node 5, so triangle <1, 8, 5> is found
- Edge (8, 0): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (0, 8): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (8, 2): Shared connection with Node 3, so triangle <8, 2, 3> is found
- Edge (2, 2): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (2, 5): Shared connection with Node 0, so triangle <2, 5, 0> is found
- Edge (5, 0): Check for shared connections, but none found
- Edge (0, 5): Check for shared connections, but none found

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <3, 4, 0>, <5, 3, 0>, <1, 8, 5>, and <8, 2, 3>.
