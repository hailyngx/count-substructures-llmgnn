Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

- Node 1 (Degree 1)
- Node 5 (Degree 2)
- Node 0 (Degree 2)
- Node 2 (Degree 3)
- Node 9 (Degree 3)
- Node 6 (Degree 4)
- Node 8 (Degree 4)
- Node 7 (Degree 5)
- Node 3 (Degree 5)
- Node 4 (Degree 6)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles as follows:

1. For edge (0, 4): No triangles formed.
2. For edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
3. For edge (2, 4): Triangle <2, 4, 7> formed.
4. For edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
5. For edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
6. For edge (3, 4): Triangle <3, 4, 7> formed.
7. For edge (3, 6): Triangle <3, 6, 7> formed.
8. For edge (3, 8): Triangle <3, 8, 7> formed.
9. For edge (3, 9): No triangles formed.
10. For edge (4, 0): No triangles formed.
11. For edge (4, 2): Triangle <2, 4, 7> formed.
12. For edge (4, 3): Triangle <3, 4, 7> formed.
13. For edge (4, 7): Triangle <3, 4, 7> formed.
14. For edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
15. For edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
16. For edge (5, 7): No triangles formed.
17. For edge (6, 2): Triangle <2, 4, 7> formed.
18. For edge (6, 3): Triangle <3, 4, 7> formed.
19. For edge (6, 5): No triangles formed.
20. For edge (6, 7): Triangle <3, 6, 7> formed.
21. For edge (7, 4): Triangle <3, 4, 7> formed.
22. For edge (7, 5): No triangles formed.
23. For edge (7, 6): Triangle <3, 6, 7> formed.
24. For edge (7, 8): Triangle <3, 8, 7> formed.
25. For edge (8, 1): No triangles formed.
26. For edge (8, 3): Triangle <3, 8, 7> formed.
27. For edge (8, 7): Triangle <3, 8, 7> formed.
28. For edge (8, 9): No triangles formed.
29. For edge (9, 3): No triangles formed.
30. For edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.
31. For edge (9, 8): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8] and the unique triangles found are <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 8, 7>.
