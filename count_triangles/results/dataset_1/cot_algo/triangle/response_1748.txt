Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees, the new labels are: 
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 7: 1 connection

Considering that we proceed with edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections, the triangles formed are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
