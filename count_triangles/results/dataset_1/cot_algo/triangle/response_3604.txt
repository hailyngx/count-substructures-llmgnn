Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Node 5 with 4 connections
Node 8 with 2 connections
Node 0 with 3 connections
Node 2 with 2 connections
Node 6 with 3 connections
Node 1 with 4 connections
Node 7 with 2 connections
Node 3 with 4 connections
Node 4 with 6 connections

Now, we can proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method and count the number of triangles:

Number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
