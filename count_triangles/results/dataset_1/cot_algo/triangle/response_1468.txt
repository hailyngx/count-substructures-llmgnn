Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 0 - Degree 1
Node 3 - Degree 1
Node 6 - Degree 2
Node 9 - Degree 3
Node 1 - Degree 4
Node 2 - Degree 4
Node 7 - Degree 4
Node 8 - Degree 5
