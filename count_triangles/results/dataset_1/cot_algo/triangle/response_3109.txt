Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle <2, 3, 4>
- Triangle <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
