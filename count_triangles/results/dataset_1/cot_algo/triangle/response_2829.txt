Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling:
Nodes: [3, 4, 6, 9, 5, 7, 2, 8, 1, 0]

After relabeling the nodes, we can count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. The triangles found in this graph are:
[Total number of triangles: 6]

<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
