Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 9: 1 connection (Node 1)
Node 0: 4 connections (Node 9, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7)
Node 3: 4 connections (Node 0, Node 2, Node 6, Node 7)
Node 2: 3 connections (Node 3, Node 6, Node 7)
Node 8: 2 connections (Node 4, Node 6)
Node 4: 2 connections (Node 0, Node 8)
Node 5: 1 connection (Node 0)
Node 6: 3 connections (Node 2, Node 3, Node 8)
Node 7: 3 connections (Node 0, Node 2, Node 3)

Using the sorted vertices and given edges, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
