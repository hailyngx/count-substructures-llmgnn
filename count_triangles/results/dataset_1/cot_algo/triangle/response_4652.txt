Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have the following mapping:
```
Vertex 5 has degree 1
Vertex 7 has degree 1
Vertex 9 has degree 1
Vertex 4 has degree 2
Vertex 7 has degree 2
Vertex 9 has degree 2
Vertex 6 has degree 3
Vertex 5 has degree 3
Vertex 1 has degree 4
Vertex 2 has degree 5
```
Following Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
Thus, we consider the edges: (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (4, 8), (5, 6), (6, 8).

Now, let's find the triangles formed by these edges:
1. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 7, 8>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
