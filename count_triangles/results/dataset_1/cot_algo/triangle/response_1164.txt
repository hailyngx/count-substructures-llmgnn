Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0: degree = 2
8: degree = 2
5: degree = 4
2: degree = 3
6: degree = 4
7: degree = 4
4: degree = 5
1: degree = 6
3: degree = 5
9: degree = 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
0 (labeled as 0): degree = 2
8 (labeled as 1): degree = 2
5 (labeled as 2): degree = 4
2 (labeled as 3): degree = 3
6 (labeled as 4): degree = 4
7 (labeled as 5): degree = 4
4 (labeled as 6): degree = 5
1 (labeled as 7): degree = 6
3 (labeled as 8): degree = 5
9 (labeled as 9): degree = 5

Now we will count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [18]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 8, 2>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 5>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 1>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 1>
<3, 5, 4>
<4, 7, 1>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 5>
<5, 6, 1>
