Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Sorted vertices based on their number of connections:
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start with the edges in the following order:
(0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 4), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 8), (8, 5)

Calculating triangles:
1. (1, 2):
   Shared connections: None

2. (1, 7):
   Shared connections: None

3. (2, 4):
   Shared connections: None

4. (4, 9):
   Shared connections: None

5. (5, 6):
   Shared connections: None

6. (5, 8):
   Shared connections: None

7. (6, 0):
   Shared connections: None

8. (6, 5):
   Shared connections: None

9. (7, 1):
   Shared connections: None

10. (7, 8):
    Shared connections: None

11. (8, 5):
    Shared connections: None

No triangles were found in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [0].
