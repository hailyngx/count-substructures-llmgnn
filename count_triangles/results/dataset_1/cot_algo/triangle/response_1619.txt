Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 1, 8, 6, 2, 9, 5, 3, 7, 4, 0

Now, we relabel the vertices as follows:
0 ⟶ 1
1 ⟶ 8
2 ⟶ 6
3 ⟶ 2
4 ⟶ 9
5 ⟶ 5
6 ⟶ 3
7 ⟶ 7
8 ⟶ 4
9 ⟶ 0

Using the relabeled vertices, the edges are as follows:
(1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 0) (8, 5) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (3, 6) (7, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (4, 1) (0, 1)

Now, we will count the triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 7]
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 7>
