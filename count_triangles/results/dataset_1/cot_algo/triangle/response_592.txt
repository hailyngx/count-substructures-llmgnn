Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

0: 2 connections
4: 1 connection
6: 1 connection
7: 1 connection
9: 3 connections
1: 5 connections
5: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
3: 5 connections
2: 4 connections

We will then relabel the vertices:

0 -> 0 (2 connections)
4 -> 1 (1 connection)
6 -> 2 (1 connection)
7 -> 3 (1 connection)
9 -> 4 (3 connections)
1 -> 5 (5 connections)
5 -> 6 (4 connections)
8 -> 7 (4 connections)
3 -> 8 (5 connections)
2 -> 9 (4 connections)

Now, we will encounter the edges one by one, making sure to only consider cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 3): Both have 2 connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (0, 8): Both have 2 connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 has fewer connections. Triangle <1, 5, 6> formed.
- Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 has fewer connections. Triangle <1, 9, 4> formed.
- Edge (2, 1): Vertex 1 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 5): Vertex 2 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 0): Vertex 3 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 2): Vertex 2 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 5): Vertex 2 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 3): Vertex 4 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 1): Vertex 5 has fewer connections. Triangle <1, 5, 6> already counted.
- Edge (5, 2): Vertex 2 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 3): Vertex 2 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 9): Vertex 2 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 2): Vertex 6 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 1): Vertex 7 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 0): Vertex 7 has fewer connections. Triangle <0, 8, 3> formed.
- Edge (8, 1): Vertex 7 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 3): Vertex 7 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 9): Vertex 7 has fewer connections. Triangle <8, 9, 4> formed.
- Edge (9, 1): Vertex 9 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 5): Vertex 9 has fewer connections. No triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 8): Vertex 9 has fewer connections. Triangle <8, 9, 4> already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <1, 5, 6> and <8, 9, 4>.
