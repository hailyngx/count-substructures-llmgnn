Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we have the following order: 
Node 0: 2 edges
Node 6: 3 edges
Node 9: 2 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 8: 2 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 1: 5 edges
Node 2: 5 edges

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles. 
Calculating the triangles <0, 2, 1> and <0, 2, 6>. 
Counting the triangle <1, 4, 7>.
Calculating the triangles <2, 0, 1>, <2, 1, 4>, and <2, 1, 6>.
Counting the triangle <3, 4, 5>.
Calculating the triangles <4, 1, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, and <4, 7, 8>.
Counting the triangle <5, 3, 4>.
Calculating the triangles <6, 0, 1> and <6, 1, 7>.
Counting the triangle <7, 4, 1>.
There is only one triangle <8, 5, 7>.
Counting the triangle <9, 2, 1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
