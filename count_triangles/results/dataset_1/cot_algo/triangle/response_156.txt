Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by the number of connections:
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections

Next, we will relabel the nodes:
Node 2 -> A (Label 1)
Node 7 -> B (Label 2)
Node 6 -> C (Label 3)
Node 5 -> D (Label 4)
Node 9 -> E (Label 5)
Node 1 -> F (Label 6)
Node 8 -> G (Label 7)
Node 4 -> H (Label 8)
Node 3 -> I (Label 9)
Node 0 -> J (Label 10)

Now, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 
We will go through each edge and check for shared connections to count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 8, 9>

In this graph, there are 8 triangles.
