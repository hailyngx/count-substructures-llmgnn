Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree. Then we relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 1: 9 connections (node 8)
Vertex 2: 4 connections (node 3)
Vertex 3: 4 connections (node 4)
Vertex 4: 4 connections (node 5)
Vertex 5: 3 connections (node 7)
Vertex 6: 3 connections (node 6)
Vertex 7: 2 connections (node 2)
Vertex 8: 0 connections (node 9)

Now, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Potential triangles:
- Considering the edge (2, 3) since vertex 2 has the lower label and fewer connections, we check for shared connections. This forms a triangle with vertex 4.
- Considering the edge (2, 7) since vertex 2 has the lower label and fewer connections, we check for shared connections. No triangle is formed.
- Considering the edge (3, 4) since vertex 3 and vertex 4 have equal labels, we skip this edge.
- Considering the edge (3, 5) since vertex 3 has the lower label and fewer connections, we check for shared connections. This forms a triangle with vertex 4.
- Considering the edge (4, 5) since vertex 4 has the lower label and fewer connections, we check for shared connections. No triangle is formed.
- Considering the edge (6, 8) since vertex 6 has the lower label and fewer connections, we check for shared connections. No triangle is formed.
- Considering the edge (8, 9) since vertex 8 has the lower label and fewer connections, we check for shared connections. No triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2], and the unique triangles are <2, 3, 4> and <3, 4, 5>.
