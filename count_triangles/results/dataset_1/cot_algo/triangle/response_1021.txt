Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting vertices by their number of connections:  
Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 7: 1 connection  
Node 6: 4 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 4: 5 connections  
Node 0: 5 connections  
Node 9: 6 connections  
Node 5: 7 connections  
  
Looking at the edges with the lower labeled vertices having fewer connections:  
Checking edge (0, 5) - Nodes 0 and 5 share connections 3, 4, and 6. Thus, triangle <0, 5, 4> is found.  
Checking edge (0, 6) - Nodes 0 and 6 share connection 4. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (0, 9) - Nodes 0 and 9 share connection 4. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (1, 7) - Nodes 1 and 7 do not share connections.  
Checking edge (2, 3) - Nodes 2 and 3 share connection 4. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (2, 4) - Nodes 2 and 4 share connections 5 and 8. Thus, triangle <2, 4, 5> is found.  
Checking edge (2, 6) - Nodes 2 and 6 share connection 4. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (3, 2) - Nodes 2 and 3 share connection 4. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (3, 5) - Nodes 3 and 5 share connection 4. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (3, 8) - Nodes 3 and 8 do not share connections.  
Checking edge (4, 2) - Nodes 2 and 4 share connections 5 and 8. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (4, 5) - Nodes 4 and 5 share connections 0 and 3. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (4, 6) - Nodes 4 and 6 share connection 7. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (4, 8) - Nodes 4 and 8 share connection 3. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (4, 9) - Nodes 4 and 9 share connection 7. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (5, 0) - Nodes 0 and 5 share connections 3, 4, and 6. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (5, 3) - Nodes 3 and 5 share connection 4. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (5, 4) - Nodes 4 and 5 share connections 0 and 3. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (5, 6) - Nodes 5 and 6 share connections 0 and 7. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (5, 8) - Nodes 5 and 8 do not share connections.  
Checking edge (5, 9) - Nodes 5 and 9 share connection 0. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (6, 0) - Nodes 0 and 6 share connection 4. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (6, 2) - Nodes 2 and 6 share connection 4. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (6, 4) - Nodes 4 and 6 share connection 7. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (6, 7) - Nodes 6 and 7 do not share connections.  
Checking edge (7, 1) - Nodes 1 and 7 do not share connections.  
Checking edge (7, 6) - Nodes 6 and 7 do not share connections.  
Checking edge (7, 9) - Nodes 7 and 9 do not share connections.  
Checking edge (8, 3) - Nodes 3 and 8 do not share connections.  
Checking edge (8, 4) - Nodes 4 and 8 share connection 3. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (8, 5) - Nodes 5 and 8 do not share connections.  
Checking edge (8, 9) - Nodes 8 and 9 do not share connections.  
Checking edge (9, 0) - Nodes 0 and 9 share connection 4. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (9, 4) - Nodes 4 and 9 share connection 7. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (9, 5) - Nodes 5 and 9 share connection 0. No new triangles found.  
Checking edge (9, 7) - Nodes 7 and 9 do not share connections.  

The total number of triangles is [2].  
The unique triangles are <0, 5, 4> and <2, 4, 5>.
