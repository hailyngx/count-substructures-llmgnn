Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following connections arranged according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 3: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 5: 8 connections

For counting triangles, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Therefore, we will analyze the following edges:

(0, 5) - Forms a triangle with node 4
(0, 7) - Forms a triangle with node 4
(1, 5)
(2, 4)
(2, 5) - Forms a triangle with node 0
(2, 8)
(2, 9)
(4, 6)
(4, 7) - Forms a triangle with node 0
(4, 8) - Forms a triangle with node 5
(5, 7) - Forms a triangle with node 0
(5, 8) - Forms a triangle with node 4

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 0, 5>, and <4, 5, 8>.
