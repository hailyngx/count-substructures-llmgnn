Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections
Vertex 2: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
[Total number of triangles: 5]
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
