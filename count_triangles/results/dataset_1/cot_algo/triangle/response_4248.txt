Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 
Vertex 0 - degree 2  
Vertex 6 - degree 1  
Vertex 2 - degree 1  
Vertex 3 - degree 2  
Vertex 4 - degree 2  
Vertex 7 - degree 3  
Vertex 9 - degree 3  
Vertex 8 - degree 3  
Vertex 5 - degree 7  
Vertex 1 - degree 7  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles: 

<0, 1, 5>  
<1, 5, 8>  
<1, 5, 7>  

[Total number of triangles: 3]
