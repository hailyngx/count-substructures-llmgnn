Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 5 has 0 connection(s).
Node 1 has 1 connection(s).
Nodes 2, 9, and 6 have 2 connection(s) each.
Nodes 4 and 5 have 3 connection(s) each.
Node 0 has 4 connection(s).
Nodes 3 and 7 have 6 connection(s) each.
Node 8 has 7 connection(s).

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 5 (0) <br>
Node 1 (1) <br>
Nodes 2, 9, 6 (2) <br>
Nodes 4, 5 (3) <br>
Node 0 (4) <br>
Nodes 3, 7 (6) <br>
Node 8 (7) <br>

Next, we will check for triangles using the edges provided:

- Edge (0, 3) forms triangles with its shared connections: 2, 6, 7 <br>
- Edge (0, 7) forms triangles with its shared connections: 6 <br>
- Edge (0, 8) forms triangles with its shared connections: 3, 6 <br>
- Edge (1, 4) forms triangles with its shared connections: 3 <br>
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle as node 2 has a higher label than node 3. <br>
- Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle due to the degree-based ordering. <br>
- Edge (3, 0) forms triangles with its shared connections: 2, 6, 7 <br>
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle as node 4 has a higher label than node 1. <br>
- Edge (4, 6) forms triangles with its shared connections: 0, 7 <br>
- Edge (4, 8) forms triangles with its shared connections: 0, 3, 6 <br>
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle as node 5 has a higher label than node 8. <br>
- Edge (6, 4) forms triangles with its shared connections: 0, 7 <br>
- Edge (6, 7) forms triangles with its shared connections: 0, 4, 8 <br>
- Edge (7, 0) forms triangles with its shared connections: 2, 3, 8 <br>
- Edge (7, 6) forms triangles with its shared connections: 0, 4, 8 <br>
- Edge (7, 8) forms triangles with its shared connections: 3, 6 <br>
- Edge (8, 0) forms triangles with its shared connections: 3, 6 <br>
- Edge (8, 4) forms triangles with its shared connections: 0, 3, 6 <br>
- Edge (8, 5) does not form a triangle as node 5 has a higher label than node 8. <br>
- Edge (8, 7) forms triangles with its shared connections: 6 <br>
