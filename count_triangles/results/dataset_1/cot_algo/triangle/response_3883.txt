Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 
1. Node 3 - degree 0
2. Node 6 - degree 0
3. Node 2 - degree 1
4. Node 9 - degree 2
5. Node 5 - degree 4
6. Node 4 - degree 4
7. Node 1 - degree 5
8. Node 8 - degree 5
9. Node 7 - degree 6
10. Node 0 - degree 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find:
- Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle <0, 7, 8>
- Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
