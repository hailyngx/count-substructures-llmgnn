Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
Node 0: 3 edges
Node 1: 3 edges
Node 2: 3 edges
Node 3: 2 edges
Node 4: 2 edges
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 6: 2 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 8: 3 edges
Node 9: 2 edges

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 1): forms a triangle with shared connection at node 0 -> <0, 1, 3>
2. Edge (0, 3): forms a triangle with shared connection at node 0 -> <0, 3, 4>
3. Edge (0, 8): forms a triangle with shared connection at node 0 -> <0, 8, 5>
4. Edge (1, 0): already covered
5. Edge (1, 6): no triangle
6. Edge (1, 7): forms a triangle with shared connection at node 1 -> <1, 7, 2>
7. Edge (2, 4): no triangle
8. Edge (2, 7): no triangle
9. Edge (2, 9): no triangle
10. Edge (3, 0): already covered
11. Edge (3, 4): already covered
12. Edge (4, 2): already covered
13. Edge (4, 3): already covered
14. Edge (5, 6): no triangle
15. Edge (5, 7): forms a triangle with shared connection at node 7 -> <5, 7, 1>
16. Edge (5, 8): no triangle
17. Edge (6, 1): already covered
18. Edge (6, 5): no triangle
19. Edge (7, 1): already covered
20. Edge (7, 2): already covered
21. Edge (7, 5): already covered
22. Edge (8, 0): already covered
23. Edge (8, 5): already covered
24. Edge (8, 9): forms a triangle with shared connection at node 9 -> <8, 9, 2>
25. Edge (9, 2): already covered
26. Edge (9, 8): already covered

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 7, 2>.
