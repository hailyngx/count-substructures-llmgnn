Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 4 [0 connection]
Node 3 [1 connection]
Node 5 [1 connection]
Node 6 [1 connection]
Node 7 [1 connection]
Node 9 [1 connection]
Node 0 [3 connections]
Node 1 [4 connections]
Node 2 [2 connections]
Node 8 [4 connections]

Edge (0, 2) is skipped since both vertices have the same number of connections (2).

Possible triangles:
1. <0, 6, 8>
2. <0, 2, 1>
3. <0, 2, 6>
4. <0, 2, 5>
5. <0, 8, 4>
6. <1, 7, 3>
7. <1, 7, 5>
8. <1, 2, 0>
9. <2, 1, 7>
10. <2, 1, 5>
11. <8, 9, 4>

Total number of triangles: [11]
