Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the degree of each node:
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 2 -> A
Node 4 -> B
Node 7 -> C
Node 5 -> D
Node 1 -> E
Node 3 -> F
Node 6 -> G
Node 9 -> H
Node 0 -> I
Node 8 -> J

Now, we will check the edges in order of the relabeled nodes:
- Edge (A, D) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (B, G) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (C, I) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (D, F) forms a triangle: <3, 5, 9>.
- Edge (E, I) forms a triangle: <0, 1, 6>.
- Edge (F, H) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (G, I) forms a triangle: <0, 6, 8>.
- Edge (H, J) does not form a triangle.

There are 3 triangles in total: <3, 5, 9>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 6, 8>.
So, the total number of triangles is [3].
