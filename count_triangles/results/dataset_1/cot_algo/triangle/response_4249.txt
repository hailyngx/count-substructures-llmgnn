Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most connections, the new labeling is:  
Node 5: Degree 1  
Nodes 1, 7: Degree 2  
Nodes 2, 8, 9: Degree 3  
Nodes 0, 4, 6: Degree 5  
Node 3: Degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge.  
Since vertices with lower labels will be considered first, we have:
- For edge (0, 1), Node 1 has fewer connections, so we check for shared connections and find a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- For edge (0, 2), Node 0 has fewer connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (0, 3), Node 3 has fewer connections, so we check for shared connections and find two triangles <0, 3, 6> and <0, 3, 9>.
- For edge (0, 4), Node 4 has fewer connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (0, 6), Node 6 has fewer connections, so we check for shared connections and find two triangles <0, 3, 6> and <0, 4, 6>.
- For edge (1, 5), Node 1 has fewer connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (2, 7), Node 2 has fewer connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (3, 6), Node 3 has fewer connections, so no new triangle is formed.
- For edge (3, 9), Node 3 has fewer connections, so no new triangle is formed.
- For edge (4, 9), Node 4 has fewer connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (6, 8), Node 6 has fewer connections, so no triangle is formed.
- For edge (7, 8), Node 7 has fewer connections, so no triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
