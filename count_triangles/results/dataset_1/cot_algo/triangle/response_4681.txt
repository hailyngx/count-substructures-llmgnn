Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections as follows:

Vertex 0 - 3 edges
Vertex 6 - 1 edge
Vertex 2 - 3 edges
Vertex 9 - 3 edges
Vertex 3 - 4 edges
Vertex 5 - 4 edges
Vertex 8 - 3 edges
Vertex 1 - 5 edges
Vertex 4 - 4 edges
Vertex 7 - 5 edges

Now, we will start counting the triangles:

Triangle <0, 1, 7>
Triangle <0, 1, 4>
Triangle <0, 7, 5>
Triangle <0, 7, 4>
Triangle <1, 4, 7>
Triangle <1, 9, 5>
Triangle <2, 3, 7>
Triangle <2, 3, 4>
Triangle <2, 5, 7>
Triangle <3, 4, 7>
Triangle <5, 7, 4>
Triangle <5, 7, 9>
Triangle <5, 9, 1>
Triangle <7, 4, 1>
Triangle <7, 5, 9>
Triangle <8, 0, 2>
Triangle <8, 0, 9>
Triangle <8, 2, 9>
Triangle <8, 2, 3>
Triangle <9, 1, 4>
Triangle <9, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [21]
