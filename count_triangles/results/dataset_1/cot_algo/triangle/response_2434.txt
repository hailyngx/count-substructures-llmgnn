Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
0 (degree 1)
3 (degree 1)
4 (degree 1)
8 (degree 1)
5 (degree 2)
6 (degree 2)
9 (degree 2)
2 (degree 3)
1 (degree 6)
7 (degree 8)

Now, we will count the triangles:

For edge (0, 7):
Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 7. No triangles formed.

For edge (3, 7):
Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 7. No triangles formed.

For edge (4, 9):
Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 9. No triangles formed.

For edge (5, 1):
Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 1. No triangles formed.

For edge (6, 1):
Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 1. No triangles formed.

For edge (8, 7):
Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 7. No triangles formed.

Counting triangles for vertex 2:
Starting from the smallest degree vertex 0 and stopping at vertex 2.
Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 1 which is greater in degree, so no triangles are formed.

Counting triangles for vertex 1:
Starting from the smallest degree vertex 0 and stopping at vertex 1.
Triangle <0, 1, 7> is formed.

Counting triangles for vertex 7:
Starting from the smallest degree vertex 0 and stopping at vertex 7.
Triangles <0, 7, 1>, <3, 7, 1>, <5, 7, 1>, <6, 7, 1> are formed.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 7>, <3, 7, 1>, <5, 7, 1>, <6, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 1>
