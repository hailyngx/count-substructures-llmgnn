Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we can relabel them as follows:
- Node 0 with 2 connections
- Node 5 with 1 connection
- Node 9 with 2 connections
- Node 1 with 4 connections
- Node 3 with 3 connections
- Node 7 with 3 connections
- Node 2 with 4 connections
- Node 8 with 4 connections
- Node 4 with 6 connections
- Node 6 with 5 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Now, let's count the triangles by examining the shared connections:
- <0, 4, 1>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 8, 2>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 7, 3>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 7, 4>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <6, 8, 4>
- <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
