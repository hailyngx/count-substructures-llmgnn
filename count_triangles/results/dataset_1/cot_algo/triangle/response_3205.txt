Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

- Vertex 1 has 2 connections
- Vertex 6 has 2 connections
- Vertices 2 and 5 have 2 connections
- Vertices 8 and 6 have 2 connections
- Vertices 9 and 5 have 2 connections
- Vertex 7 has 4 connections
- Vertex 3 has 4 connections
- Vertex 4 has 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices in order of increasing connections:

- Vertex 1 and 6
- Vertices 2 and 5
- Vertices 8 and 9
- Vertex 7
- Vertex 3
- Vertex 4

Next, we will identify the triangles in the graph based on the shared connections between the vertices:

- Triangle <3, 7, 9>
- Triangle <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <3, 7, 9> and <3, 4, 7>.
