Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

0: degree 4
1: degree 3
2: degree 1
3: degree 1
4: degree 4
5: degree 2
6: degree 2
7: degree 1
8: degree 4
9: degree 4

Based on the sorted list, we relabel the vertices:
0 -> 0
1 -> 3
2 -> 7
3 -> 2
4 -> 1
5 -> 5
6 -> 6
7 -> 4
8 -> 8
9 -> 9

Now, we analyze the edges according to the relabeling:

0-1: (0, 1) - 0 and 1 do not have fewer connections
0-3: (0, 3) - 0 and 3 do not have fewer connections
0-4: (0, 4) - 0 has fewer connections than 4
Triangles: <0, 1, 4>

0-8: (0, 8) - 0 has fewer connections than 8
Triangles: <0, 4, 8>

1-4: (1, 4) - 3 has fewer connections than 4
Triangles: <1, 3, 4>

1-5: (1, 5) - 3 has fewer connections than 5
2-8: (2, 8) - 7 has fewer connections than 8
3-0: (3, 0) - 2 has fewer connections than 0
4-0: (4, 0) - 1 has fewer connections than 0
4-1: (4, 1) - 1 and 4 do not have fewer connections
4-9: (4, 9) - 1 has fewer connections than 9
Triangles: <1, 4, 9>

5-1: (5, 1) - 5 and 1 do not have fewer connections
5-6: (5, 6) - 5 has fewer connections than 6
Triangles: <1, 5, 6>

6-5: (6, 5) - 6 has fewer connections than 5
6-8: (6, 8) - 6 has fewer connections than 8
7-9: (7, 9) - 4 has fewer connections than 9
8-0: (8, 0) - 8 has fewer connections than 0
8-2: (8, 2) - 7 has fewer connections than 2
8-6: (8, 6) - 6 has fewer connections than 8
8-9: (8, 9) - 8 has fewer connections than 9
9-4: (9, 4) - 4 and 9 do not have fewer connections
9-7: (9, 7) - 7 has fewer connections than 9
