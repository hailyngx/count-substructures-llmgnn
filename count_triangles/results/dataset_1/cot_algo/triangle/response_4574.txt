Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
By arranging the nodes based on their degree, the vertices can be relabeled as follows: 

| Original Label | Relabeled Label | Degree |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| 2              | 0               | 2      |
| 5              | 1               | 2      |
| 6              | 2               | 2      |
| 3              | 3               | 2      |
| 8              | 4               | 3      |
| 9              | 5               | 4      |
| 4              | 6               | 4      |
| 1              | 7               | 4      |
| 7              | 8               | 5      |
| 0              | 9               | 5      |

The edges in the new labeling become: (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) 

Using the degree-based ordering method, we can count the total number of triangles: 

There are [11] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 0, 5>
<4, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 1, 6>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
