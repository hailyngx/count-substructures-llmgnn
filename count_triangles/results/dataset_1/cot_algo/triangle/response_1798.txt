Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 6

Now, we can find the triangles by checking for shared connections between vertices starting from the vertices with lower degrees.

The total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
