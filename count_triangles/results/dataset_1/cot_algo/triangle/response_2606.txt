Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices by degree: 
0 - degree 3
1 - degree 5
2 - degree 3
3 - degree 3
4 - degree 5
5 - degree 1
7 - degree 4
8 - degree 2
9 - degree 1

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degree (from least to most connections):
0 → 1
2 → 2
3 → 3
4 → 4
8 → 5
1 → 6
7 → 7
9 → 8
5 → 9

Now, we consider each edge:
(0, 1) - Proceed since vertex 0 has fewer connections.
Shared connections with 1: 3, 7
Triangle found: <0, 1, 3>

(0, 7) - Proceed since vertex 0 has fewer connections.
Shared connections with 7: 1, 4
Triangle found: <0, 7, 1>
No new triangles formed.

(0, 9) - Proceed since vertex 0 has fewer connections.
No new triangles formed.

(1, 0) - Do not proceed since vertex 1 has more connections.

(1, 2) - Do not proceed since vertex 1 has more connections.

(1, 3) - Do not proceed since vertex 1 has more connections.

(1, 7) - Proceed since vertex 1 has fewer connections.
Shared connections with 7: 0, 4
Triangle found: <1, 7, 0>
No new triangles formed.

(1, 8) - Do not proceed since vertex 1 has more connections.

(2, 1) - Proceed since vertex 2 has fewer connections.
Triangle found: <2, 1, 3>

(2, 3) - Proceed since vertex 2 has fewer connections.
No new triangles formed.

(2, 4) - Proceed since vertex 2 has fewer connections.
Shared connections with 4: 3
Triangle found: <2, 4, 3>

(3, 1) - Do not proceed since vertex 3 has more connections.

(3, 2) - Do not proceed since vertex 3 has more connections.

(3, 4) - Do not proceed since vertex 3 has more connections.

(4, 2) - Do not proceed since vertex 4 has more connections.

(4, 3) - Do not proceed since vertex 4 has more connections.

(4, 5) - Do not proceed since vertex 4 has more connections.

(4, 7) - Proceed since vertex 4 has fewer connections.
Shared connections with 7: 0, 1
Triangle found: <4, 7, 1>

(4, 8) - Do not proceed since vertex 4 has more connections.

(5, 4) - Do not proceed since vertex 5 has more connections.

(7, 0) - Do not proceed since vertex 7 has more connections.

(7, 1) - Do not proceed since vertex 7 has more connections.

(7, 4) - Proceed since vertex 7 has fewer connections.
No new triangles formed.

(8, 1) - Do not proceed since vertex 8 has more connections.

(8, 4) - Do not proceed since vertex 8 has more connections.

(9, 0) - Do not proceed since vertex 9 has more connections.

The total number of triangles is [5].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 7, 1>, <2, 1, 3>, <2, 4, 3>, <4, 7, 1>.
