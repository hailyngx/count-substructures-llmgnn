Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
Nodes with their connections:
1. Node 0: 2 connections
2. Node 1: 2 connections
3. Node 3: 2 connections
4. Node 7: 2 connections
5. Node 6: 3 connections
6. Node 8: 3 connections
7. Node 4: 4 connections
8. Node 2: 3 connections
9. Node 5: 6 connections
10. Node 9: 8 connections

We will relabel the nodes from 0 to 9 based on the number of connections:
Node 0: 0 connections -> New label: 0
Node 1: 2 connections -> New label: 1
Node 3: 2 connections -> New label: 2
Node 7: 2 connections -> New label: 3
Node 6: 3 connections -> New label: 4
Node 8: 3 connections -> New label: 5
Node 4: 4 connections -> New label: 6
Node 2: 3 connections -> New label: 7
Node 5: 6 connections -> New label: 8
Node 9: 8 connections -> New label: 9

Now, we will count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge:
Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <3, 4, 7>
4. <3, 5, 6>
5. <3, 5, 8>
6. <4, 5, 9>
7. <4, 6, 9>
8. <5, 6, 9>
9. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
