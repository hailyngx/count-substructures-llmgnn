Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

1. Vertex 7 (Node 7) - 0 connections
2. Vertex 4 (Node 4) - 2 connections
3. Vertex 9 (Node 9) - 2 connections
4. Vertex 5 (Node 5) - 3 connections
5. Vertex 8 (Node 8) - 3 connections
6. Vertex 3 (Node 3) - 4 connections
7. Vertex 1 (Node 1) - 5 connections
8. Vertex 0 (Node 0) - 5 connections
9. Vertex 2 (Node 2) - 5 connections
10. Vertex 6 (Node 6) - 7 connections

Starting the process, the triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
