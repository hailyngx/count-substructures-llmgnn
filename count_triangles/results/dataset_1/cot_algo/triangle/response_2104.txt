Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 2: degree 7

Following the Degree Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges starting from the nodes with lower degrees.

For the given graph, the triangles formed are:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <2, 4, 5>
6. <2, 4, 9>
7. <2, 5, 6>
8. <2, 5, 8>
9. <2, 6, 7>
10. <2, 6, 8>
11. <2, 6, 9>
12. <2, 7, 8>
13. <2, 7, 9>
14. <4, 5, 9>
15. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
