Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are:
Vertices: 5, 1, 4, 2, 8, 6, 3, 9, 7, 0 

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

There are 20 triangles in the graph, and they are:
<[7, 0, 9], [7, 2, 9], [7, 8, 9], [0, 1, 6], [0, 3, 6], [0, 4, 7], [1, 3, 6], [2, 3, 7], [2, 3, 9], [2, 7, 8], [3, 6, 9], [3, 7, 9], [5, 8, 9], [6, 7, 9], [0, 7, 9], [1, 6, 9], [3, 7, 8], [2, 7, 9], [8, 5, 9], [0, 6, 9]>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
