Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new order is as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:
- Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with node 4: <0, 4, 6>
- Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with node 2: <0, 2, 9>
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with node 3: <1, 3, 7>
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 2, 9>
- Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 7) forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 3, 7>
- Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 4, 6>
- Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 0) forms a triangle with node 4: <0, 4, 6>
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 3) forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 3, 7>
- Edge (7, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 7, 9>
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 2) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 2, 9>
- Edge (9, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
