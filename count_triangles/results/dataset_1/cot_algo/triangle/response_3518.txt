Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling:
Nodes: 1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 9, 6, 7, 2, 4

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge: (0, 4) - Node 0 has 2 connections, Node 4 has 6 connections
   Shared neighbors of 0 and 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
   Number of triangles: 1

2. Edge: (0, 5) - Node 0 has 2 connections, Node 5 has 3 connections
   Shared neighbors of 0 and 5: 2, 4, 2
   Number of triangles: 1

3. Edge: (1, 4) - Node 1 has 0 connections, Node 4 has 6 connections
   No triangles formed.

4. Edge: (2, 4) - Node 2 has 5 connections, Node 4 has 6 connections
   Shared neighbors of 2 and 4: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
   Number of triangles: 1

5. Edge: (2, 5) - Node 2 has 5 connections, Node 5 has 3 connections
   Shared neighbors of 2 and 5: 0, 9
   Number of triangles: 1

6. Edge: (2, 6) - Node 2 has 5 connections, Node 6 has 4 connections
   Shared neighbors of 2 and 6: 4
   Number of triangles: 1
