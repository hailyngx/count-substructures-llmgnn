Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles in the given graph:

Node 3 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 1 connection.
Node 3 and 7 have the lowest degrees.

Relabeling the nodes:
Node 3 -> 0
Node 7 -> 1
Node 0 -> 2
Node 1 -> 3
Node 2 -> 4
Node 4 -> 5
Node 8 -> 6
Node 5 -> 7
Node 6 -> 8
Node 9 -> 9

After relabeling, the edges become:
(2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9)
(3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9)
(4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9)
(5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9)
(6, 2) (6, 5)
(7, 3) (7, 5)
(8, 3) (8, 4)
(9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5)

Now, counting the triangles:
- Triangle <2, 3, 4>
- Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle <3, 4, 8>
- Triangle <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle <3, 6, 5>
- Triangle <4, 5, 9>
- Triangle <7, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
