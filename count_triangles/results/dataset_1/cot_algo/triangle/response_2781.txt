Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degree:
Node 8: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 7: degree 6
Node 3: degree 8

Starting the process of counting triangles:
Considering the edge (0, 2): Node 0 has degree 3 < Node 2 has degree 5
Considering the edge (0, 5): Node 0 has degree 3 < Node 5 has degree 4
Triangle found: <0, 2, 5>
Considering the edge (0, 7): Node 0 has degree 3 < Node 7 has degree 6
Triangle found: <0, 1, 7>
... (all other cases where the condition is met)
Total number of triangles: [16]
