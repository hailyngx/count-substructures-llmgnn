Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections

Now, let's reorder the vertices based on the number of connections in ascending order:
- Vertex 7 (1 connection)
- Vertex 2 (2 connections)
- Vertex 5 (3 connections)
- Vertex 8 (3 connections)
- Vertex 0 (4 connections)
- Vertex 1 (4 connections)
- Vertex 3 (4 connections)
- Vertex 4 (4 connections)
- Vertex 9 (4 connections)
- Vertex 6 (5 connections)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method while considering the connections in increasing order:

1. Edge (7, 8): No triangle
2. Edge (2, 4): No triangle
3. Edge (5, 8): Triangle <5, 8, 2>
4. Edge (5, 9): Triangle <5, 9, 0>
5. Edge (8, 7): No triangle
6. Edge (0, 9): Triangle <0, 9, 5>
7. Edge (1, 9): No triangle
8. Edge (1, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 2>
9. Edge (2, 8): No triangle
10. Edge (3, 6): Triangle <3, 6, 0>
11. Edge (3, 1): Triangle <3, 1, 4>
12. Edge (3, 0): Triangle <3, 0, 9>

Count of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <5, 8, 2>, <5, 9, 0>, <0, 9, 5>, <1, 4, 2>, <3, 6, 0>, <3, 1, 4>, <3, 0, 9>
