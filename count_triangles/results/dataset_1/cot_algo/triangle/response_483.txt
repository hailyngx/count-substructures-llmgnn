Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, we get the following ordering: 

Vertices: 
1. Vertex 0: degree 4
2. Vertex 1: degree 4
3. Vertex 5: degree 3
4. Vertex 9: degree 3
5. Vertex 4: degree 2
6. Vertex 8: degree 2
7. Vertex 6: degree 2
8. Vertex 3: degree 2
9. Vertex 7: degree 2
10. Vertex 2: degree 1

Now, we will iterate over each edge in the decreasing order of the labels and count the triangles formed:

Looking at the edges: 
1. (9, 7)
2. (8, 5)
3. (8, 1)
4. (8, 0)
5. (7, 1)
6. (6, 1)
7. (6, 5)
8. (5, 9)
9. (5, 8)
10. (5, 6)
11. (4, 3)
12. (4, 0)
13. (3, 1)
14. (2, 0)

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].

The triangles are: 
<5, 8, 9>
<1, 6, 5>
