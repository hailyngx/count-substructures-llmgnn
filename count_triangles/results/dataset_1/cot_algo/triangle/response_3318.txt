Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently in this graph. 

The sorted vertices based on their degree are:
Vertices with 1 connection: 1, 3
Vertices with 2 connections: 7, 8
Vertices with 3 connections: 2
Vertices with 4 connections: 0, 6
Vertices with 5 connections: 5
Vertices with 6 connections: 4
Vertices with 7 connections: 9

Using these sorted vertices, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The number of triangles in the graph is [9].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 7>
