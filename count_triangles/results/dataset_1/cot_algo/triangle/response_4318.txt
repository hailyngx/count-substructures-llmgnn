Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new vertex labels are as follows: 

Node 5: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. (2, 6): Shared connections: 0, 3
2. (3, 6): Shared connections: 0, 2
3. (6, 7): Shared connections: 1
4. (0, 3): Shared connections: 9
5. (0, 9): Shared connections: 3
6. (1, 7): Shared connections: 6
7. (1, 9): Shared connections: 0
8. (3, 9): Shared connections: 0

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, and <0, 1, 7>.
