Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled based on the number of connections they have:

Vertex 0 has 3 connections
Vertex 2 has 2 connections
Vertex 6 has 2 connections
Vertex 7 has 2 connections
Vertex 9 has 2 connections
Vertex 1 has 4 connections
Vertex 4 has 4 connections
Vertex 8 has 4 connections
Vertex 3 has 5 connections
Vertex 5 has 5 connections

Now, we will iterate through each edge in the graph starting from the one with the vertex with the lower label and count the triangles formed:

Triangles: 
[9]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
