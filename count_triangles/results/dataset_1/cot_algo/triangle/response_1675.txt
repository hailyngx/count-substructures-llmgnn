Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by degree are: 5, 9, 3, 2, 7, 8, 6, 0, 4, 1. 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph: 

We start with the edge (5, 9):
- No triangles can be formed with these two vertices.

Next, we move to the edge (9, 3):
- No triangles can be formed with these two vertices.

Then, we look at the edge (3, 2):
- Since vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 3, we skip this edge.

Moving on to the edge (2, 7):
- No triangles can be formed with these two vertices.

Next, we have the edge (7, 8):
- No triangles can be formed with these two vertices.

Then, we examine the edge (8, 6):
- No triangles can be formed with these two vertices.

Moving to the edge (6, 0):
- Vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 6, so we proceed.
- Shared connections with vertex 0 and 6: 1, 4.
- Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>.

Next, we have the edge (0, 4):
- Vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 4, so we proceed.
- Shared connections with vertex 0 and 4: 1.
- Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>.

Then, we look at the edge (4, 1):
- Vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 4, so we skip this edge.

Moving on to the edge (1, 6):
- Vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 1, so we proceed.
- Shared connections with vertex 1 and 6: 4.
- Triangle formed: <1, 4, 6>.

Finally, we examine the edge (6, 8):
- Vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 6, so we skip this edge.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4> and <1, 4, 6>.
