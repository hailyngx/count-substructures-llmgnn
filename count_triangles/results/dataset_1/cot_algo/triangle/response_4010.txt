Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves first sorting the vertices based on the number of connections:

Node 7: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5

Now, we will go through the edges one by one, making sure to consider only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 has connections with nodes 1 and 2, so there is one triangle <0, 1, 2>.
2. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 has connections with nodes 1 and 2, so there is one triangle <0, 1, 2>.
3. Edge (0, 4): Node 0 has connections with nodes 2 and 4, so there is one triangle <0, 2, 4>.
4. Edge (0, 8): Node 0 has connections with nodes 5 and 8, so no triangle.
5. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 2, and 9, so there is one triangle <0, 1, 2>.
6. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 2, and 9, so there is one triangle <0, 1, 9>.
7. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has connections with nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9; Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 2, and 3, so there is one triangle <3, 4, 0>.
8. Edge (3, 5): Node 3 has connections with nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9; Node 5 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 6, 8, and 9; so there are two triangles <3, 5, 0> and <3, 5, 9>.
9. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 has connections with nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9; Node 6 has connections with nodes 3, 5, and 7, so there is one triangle <3, 6, 5>.
10. Remaining edges do not form additional triangles.

The total number of triangles inside brackets is [7].
