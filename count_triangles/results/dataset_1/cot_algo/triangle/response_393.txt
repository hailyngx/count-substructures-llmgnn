Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees from least to most connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: {1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 7, 2, 0, 8, 9}.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle <2, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
