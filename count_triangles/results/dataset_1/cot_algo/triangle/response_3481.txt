Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 7

Next, we will proceed to count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering:

1. (0, 4):
   - Shared connections: 5
   - Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>

2. (0, 5):
   - Shared connections: None

3. (1, 3):
   - Shared connections: None

4. (1, 5):
   - Shared connections: None

5. (1, 6):
   - Shared connections: None

6. (2, 4):
   - Shared connections: None

7. (2, 5):
   - Shared connections: None

8. (2, 7):
   - Shared connections: None

9. (2, 8):
   - Shared connections: None

10. (2, 9):
    - Shared connections: 5
    - Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>

11. (3, 1):
    - Shared connections: None

12. (3, 9):
    - Shared connections: None

13. (4, 0):
    - Shared connections: None

14. (4, 2):
    - Shared connections: None

15. (4, 5):
    - Shared connections: 6, 6
    - Triangles formed: <0, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 6>

16. (4, 6):
    - Shared connections: None

17. (5, 0):
    - Shared connections: None

18. (5, 1):
    - Shared connections: None

19. (5, 2):
    - Shared connections: None

20. (5, 4):
    - Shared connections: 6
    - Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>

21. (5, 6):
    - Shared connections: None

22. (5, 7):
    - Shared connections: None

23. (5, 9):
    - Shared connections: 2
    - Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>

24. (6, 1):
    - Shared connections: None

25. (6, 4):
    - Shared connections: None

26. (6, 5):
    - Shared connections: None

27. (6, 9):
    - Shared connections: None

28. (7, 2):
    - Shared connections: None

29. (7, 5):
    - Shared connections: None

30. (8, 2):
    - Shared connections: None

31. (9, 2):
    - Shared connections: 5
    - Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>

32. (9, 3):
    - Shared connections: None

33. (9, 5):
    - Shared connections: 2
    - Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>

34. (9, 6):
    - Shared connections: None

Based on the process above, we found 5 unique triangles:
<0, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
