Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 2 -- 1 -- 6
|           | /
4 -- 9 -- 8 -- 5
| /
7 -- 3
```

Now, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices with their degrees:
0: 2
1: 3
3: 2
6: 2
4: 4
9: 5
8: 4
5: 3
7: 3
2: 6

After sorting:
0, 3, 6, 1, 5, 7, 8, 4, 9, 2

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<8, 5, 9>
