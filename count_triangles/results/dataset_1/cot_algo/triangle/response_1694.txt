Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices with their corresponding degrees:

0: degree 2
1: degree 2
2: degree 2
3: degree 4
4: degree 1
5: degree 2
6: degree 2
7: degree 2
8: degree 6
9: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

4: degree 1
0: degree 2
1: degree 2
2: degree 2
5: degree 2
6: degree 2
7: degree 2
3: degree 4
9: degree 4
8: degree 6

Next, we will go through the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Edge (0, 3): Check shared connections between 0 and 3: Shared connection with 8. Triangle <0, 3, 8>.
Edge (0, 8): Proceed.
Edge (1, 3): Check shared connections between 1 and 3: Shared connection with 9. Triangle <1, 3, 9>.
Edge (1, 9): Proceed.
Edge (2, 5): Proceed.
Edge (2, 9): Check shared connections between 2 and 9: Shared connection with 1. Triangle <1, 2, 9>.
Edge (3, 0): Already counted.
Edge (3, 1): Already counted.
Edge (3, 8): Proceed.
Edge (4, 8): Proceed.
Edge (5, 2): Proceed.
Edge (5, 6): Proceed.
Edge (6, 5): Proceed.
Edge (6, 8): Proceed.
Edge (7, 8): Proceed.
Edge (7, 9): Proceed.
Edge (8, 0): Already counted.
Edge (8, 3): Already counted.
Edge (8, 4): Proceed.
Edge (8, 6): Proceed.
Edge (8, 7): Proceed.
Edge (8, 9): Check shared connections between 8 and 9: Shared connection with 3. Triangle <3, 8, 9>.
Edge (9, 1): Already counted.
Edge (9, 2): Already counted.
Edge (9, 7): Proceed.
Edge (9, 8): Already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 4 as shown below:
