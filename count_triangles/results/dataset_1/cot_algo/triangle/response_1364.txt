Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 6

Now let's relabel the vertices in ascending order based on their degree:
Node 0 -> Node 0 (degree 2)
Node 1 -> Node 1 (degree 2)
Node 2 -> Node 2 (degree 2)
Node 7 -> Node 3 (degree 2)
Node 8 -> Node 4 (degree 2)
Node 6 -> Node 5 (degree 2)
Node 4 -> Node 6 (degree 4)
Node 5 -> Node 7 (degree 5)
Node 3 -> Node 8 (degree 5)
Node 9 -> Node 9 (degree 6)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (0, 3): Both nodes have degree 5, so proceed. Shared connections: 9
2. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 has degree 2, so skip.
3. Edge (1, 5): Both nodes have degree 5, so proceed. Shared connections: 9
4. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 has degree 2, so skip.
5. Edge (2, 5): Node 2 has degree 2, so skip.
6. Edge (2, 9): Node 2 has degree 2, so skip.
7. Edge (3, 0): Both nodes have degree 2, so proceed. Shared connections: 9
8. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has degree 2, so skip.
9. Edge (3, 7): Node 3 has degree 2, so skip.
10. Edge (3, 9): Node 3 has degree 2, so skip.
11. Edge (4, 3): Node 4 has degree 2, so skip.
12. Edge (4, 5): Both nodes have degree 5, so proceed. Shared connections: 6, 9
13. Edge (4, 6): Node 4 has degree 2, so skip.
14. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 has degree 2, so skip.
15. Edge (5, 1): Node 5 has degree 2, so skip.
16. Edge (5, 2): Node 5 has degree 2, so skip.
17. Edge (5, 4): Both nodes have degree 4, so proceed. Shared connections: 6
18. Edge (5, 6): Both nodes have degree 2, so proceed. Shared connections: 4
19. Edge (5, 9): Node 5 has degree 2, so skip.
20. Edge (6, 4): Node 6 has degree 2, so skip.
21. Edge (6, 5): Node 6 has degree 2, so skip.
22. Edge (7, 3): Node 7 has degree 2, so skip.
23. Edge (7, 8): Node 7 has degree 2, so skip.
24. Edge (8, 4): Node 8 has degree 2, so skip.
25. Edge (8, 7): Node 8 has degree 2, so skip.
26. Edge (9, 0): Node 9 has degree 6, so skip.
27. Edge (9, 1): Node 9 has degree 6, so skip.
28. Edge (9, 2): Node 9 has degree 6, so skip.
29. Edge (9, 3): Node 9 has degree 6, so skip.
30. Edge (9, 5): Node 9 has degree 6, so skip.
