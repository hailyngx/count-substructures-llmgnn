Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the nodes will be: 
Node 7 (Degree 0): {7}
Node 0 (Degree 3): {0}
Node 4 (Degree 3): {1}
Node 1 (Degree 4): {2}
Node 3 (Degree 4): {3}
Node 6 (Degree 4): {4}
Node 8 (Degree 2): {5}
Node 9 (Degree 7): {6}
Node 2 (Degree 5): {8}
Node 5 (Degree 3): {9}

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(7, _) (0, _) (4, _) (1, _) (3, _) (6, _) (8, _) (2, _) (5, _)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the connections between the vertices:
- For the edge (7, _), there are no connections.
- For the edge (0, 4), a triangle <0, 2, 4> is formed.
- For the edge (4, 1), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (1, 3), a triangle <1, 2, 3> is formed.
- For the edge (3, 6), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (6, 8), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (8, 2), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (2, 5), no triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
