Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 6: Degree 0
Node 8: Degree 0
Node 1: Degree 1
Node 2: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5

Based on the degree-based ordering, the edges to consider are:
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 4)

Calculating the triangles formed:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 4>

Total number of triangles: [4]
