Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labeling of the vertices will be:
Vertex 5: degree 1
Vertex 6: degree 1
Vertex 7: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 2
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 3
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges in the following order:
(5, 8), (6, 3), (6, 3), (0, 8), (0, 3), (0, 3), (0, 3), (1, 9), (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 3), (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 7)

Counting the triangles formed by each edge, we find the following triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 2>
<2, 3, 4>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
