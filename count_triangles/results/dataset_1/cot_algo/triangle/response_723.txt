Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following order: 
Node 7 - 2 connections
Node 3 - 2 connections
Node 1 - 3 connections
Node 8 - 3 connections
Node 5 - 4 connections
Node 2 - 4 connections
Node 4 - 4 connections
Node 0 - 5 connections
Node 9 - 5 connections
Node 6 - 5 connections

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method. 
Considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle <0, 1, 6>.
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle <0, 6, 9>.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 6) forms a triangle <2, 6, 9>.
- Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
