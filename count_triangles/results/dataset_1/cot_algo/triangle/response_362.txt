Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 1
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 1
- Node 7: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 1
- Node 9: Degree 2

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 3: 0
- Node 6: 1
- Node 8: 2
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 4
- Node 9: 5
- Node 7: 6
- Node 5: 7
- Node 2: 8
- Node 4: 9

Now, let's analyze the edges based on the relabeled nodes:
- (0, 2): Forms a triangle with node 7. Triangle: <0, 2, 7>
- (0, 7): No triangle formed.
- (1, 5): No triangle formed.
- (1, 9): No triangle formed.
- (2, 0): No triangle formed.
- (2, 4): Forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 7. Triangle: <2, 4, 5>
- (2, 5): No triangle formed.
- (3, 4): No triangle formed.
- (4, 2): No triangle formed.
- (4, 3): No triangle formed.
- (4, 7): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5. Triangle: <4, 5, 7>
- (4, 9): Forms a triangle with node 1. Triangle: <1, 4, 9>
- (5, 1): No triangle formed.
- (5, 2): No triangle formed.
- (5, 6): No triangle formed.
- (6, 5): No triangle formed.
- (7, 0): No triangle formed.
- (7, 4): No triangle formed.
- (7, 8): No triangle formed.
- (8, 7): No triangle formed.
- (9, 1): No triangle formed.
- (9, 4): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [3]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 9>.
