Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following labels for the nodes:
- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 1: 6 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 4: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting the triangles:
1. For edge (0, 1): Node 0 has connections with Node 1, Node 2 has connections with Node 1, and Node 5 has connections with Node 1. So, we have the triangle <0, 1, 5>.
2. For edge (0, 2): Node 0 has a connection with Node 2 and Node 5 has connections with Node 2. We have the triangle <0, 2, 5>.
3. For edge (0, 3): Node 0 has connections with Node 3, Node 5 has connections with Node 3, and Node 7 has connections with Node 3. We have the triangle <0, 3, 5>.
4. For edge (0, 4): Node 0 has connections with Node 4, Node 8 has connections with Node 4, and Node 1 has connections with Node 4. We have the triangle <0, 4, 1>.
5. For edge (0, 8): Node 0 has connections with Node 8, Node 4 has connections with Node 8, and Node 1 has connections with Node 8. We have the triangle <0, 8, 1>.

The total number of triangles is [5].
