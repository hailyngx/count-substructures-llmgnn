Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 4: 0 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Nodes 1 and 6: 2 connections
Nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

Calculating total triangles:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
