Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 5 (degree 2)
- Node 6 (degree 2)
- Node 8 (degree 2)
- Node 4 (degree 3)
- Node 7 (degree 3)
- Node 9 (degree 3)
- Node 0 (degree 4)
- Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 3 (degree 4)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Thus, we will analyze the following edges:
- (0, 5)
- (0, 7)
- (0, 9)
- (1, 2)
- (1, 3)
- (1, 8)
- (2, 3)
- (2, 7)
- (3, 4)
- (4, 6)
- (4, 8)
- (5, 6)
- (7, 9)

By examining the shared connections between the endpoints of these edges, we find the following triangles:
- <2, 3, 7>
- <1, 2, 3>
- <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
