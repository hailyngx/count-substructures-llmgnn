Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 -> 1 connection
Node 1 -> 2 connections
Node 4 -> 2 connections
Node 8 -> 2 connections
Node 3 -> 3 connections
Node 9 -> 3 connections
Node 6 -> 4 connections
Node 2 -> 5 connections
Node 7 -> 6 connections
Node 5 -> 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 7) forms triangle <0, 7, 4>.
- Edge (0, 9) forms triangle <0, 9, 3>.
- Edge (1, 2) forms no triangle.
- Edge (1, 5) forms no triangle.
- Edge (2, 1) forms no triangle.
- Edge (2, 5) forms no triangle.
- Edge (2, 7) forms triangle <2, 7, 6>.
- Edge (3, 5) forms no triangle.
- Edge (3, 8) forms no triangle.
- Edge (3, 9) forms no triangle.
- Edge (4, 7) forms no triangle.
- Edge (5, 1) forms no triangle.
- Edge (5, 2) forms no triangle.
- Edge (5, 3) forms no triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) forms triangle <5, 6, 7>.
- Edge (5, 7) forms no triangle.
- Edge (6, 5) forms no triangle.
- Edge (6, 7) forms no triangle.
- Edge (6, 8) forms no triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) forms triangle <6, 9, 3>.
- Edge (7, 0) forms no triangle.
- Edge (7, 2) forms no triangle.
- Edge (7, 4) forms triangle <7, 4, 0>.
- Edge (7, 5) forms no triangle.
- Edge (7, 6) forms triangle <7, 6, 5>.
- Edge (8, 3) forms no triangle.
- Edge (8, 6) forms no triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) forms no triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) forms no triangle.
- Edge (9, 6) forms no triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
