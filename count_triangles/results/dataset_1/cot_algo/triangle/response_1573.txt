Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following relabeling: 

Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.

Now, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Examining the edges:
(1, 4) and (4, 1) form a triangle with Node 3. Triangle <1, 4, 3>.
(1, 7) and (7, 1) do not form a triangle.
(2, 6) forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 3. Triangle <2, 6, 5>.
(2, 7) and (7, 2) form a triangle with Node 1. Triangle <2, 7, 1>.
(2, 8) and (8, 2) form a triangle with Node 4 and Node 5. Triangle <2, 8, 4>.
(3, 4) and (4, 3) form a triangle with Node 1. Triangle <3, 4, 1>.
(3, 5) and (5, 3) do not form a triangle.
(3, 7) and (7, 3) do not form a triangle.
(4, 8) does not form a triangle.
(5, 8) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
