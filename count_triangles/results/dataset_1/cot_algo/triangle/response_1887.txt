Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order. Relabeling the nodes accordingly:

Node 0 connects to: 1, 3, 4 (degree = 3)
Node 1 connects to: 0, 6, 9 (degree = 3)
Node 2 connects to: 3, 9 (degree = 2)
Node 4 connects to: 0, 6 (degree = 2)
Node 5 connects to: 3 (degree = 1)
Node 7 connects to: 3 (degree = 1)

With this new labeling, we can now proceed by checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

After checking all edges, we find that there are 6 triangles in the graph. Thus, the total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
