Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on the number of connections as follows:

Vertex 2: Degree 1
Vertex 3: Degree 1
Vertex 1: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 2
Vertex 8: Degree 2
Vertex 4: Degree 2
Vertex 0: Degree 3
Vertex 9: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 5
Vertex 6: Degree 6

Using the sorted vertices, we will examine each edge and count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 6):
    - Both vertices have more connections than the other.
    - No triangle is formed.

2. Edge (0, 7):
    - Both vertices have more connections than the other.
    - No triangle is formed.

3. Edge (1, 8):
    - Both vertices have more connections than the other.
    - No triangle is formed.

4. Edge (2, 5):
    - Vertex 2 has fewer connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

5. Edge (3, 6):
    - Vertex 3 has fewer connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

6. Edge (4, 5):
    - Vertex 4 has fewer connections.
    - Shared connection with vertex 9 forms a triangle: <4, 5, 9>.

7. Edge (4, 9):
    - Vertex 4 has fewer connections.
    - Shared connection with vertex 5 does not form a new triangle.

8. Edge (5, 2):
    - Vertex 2 has fewer connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

9. Edge (5, 4):
    - Vertex 4 has fewer connections.
    - Shared connection with vertex 9 does not form a new triangle.

10. Edge (5, 9):
    - Vertex 5 has fewer connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

11. Edge (6, 0):
    - Vertex 0 has fewer connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

12. Edge (6, 3):
    - Vertex 3 has fewer connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

13. Edge (6, 5):
    - Vertex 5 has more connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

14. Edge (6, 9):
    - Vertex 6 has fewer connections.
    - Shared connection with vertices 4 and 5 forms two triangles: <4, 6, 9> and <5, 6, 9>.

15. Edge (7, 0):
    - Vertex 0 has more connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

16. Edge (7, 8):
    - Vertex 7 has fewer connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

17. Edge (8, 1):
    - Vertex 1 has fewer connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

18. Edge (8, 7):
    - Vertex 7 has fewer connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

19. Edge (9, 4):
    - Vertex 4 has more connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

20. Edge (9, 5):
    - Vertex 5 has more connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

21. Edge (9, 6):
    - Vertex 6 has more connections.
    - No shared connections with other vertices.
    - No triangle is formed.

Based on the analysis, the total number of triangles is [3]. The unique triangles found are <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <5, 6, 9>.
