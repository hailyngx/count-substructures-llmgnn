Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree.

Vertices in ascending order of their degrees:
- Vertex 4: Connected to 1
- Vertex 5: Connected to 2
- Vertex 8: Connected to 2
- Vertex 9: Connected to 3
- Vertex 2: Connected to 3
- Vertex 7: Connected to 3
- Vertex 1: Connected to 3
- Vertex 0: Connected to 4
- Vertex 6: Connected to 4
- Vertex 3: Connected to 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0 (Degree 4) becomes vertex A
- Vertex 6 (Degree 4) becomes vertex B
- Vertex 3 (Degree 4) becomes vertex C
- Vertex 1 (Degree 3) becomes vertex D
- Vertex 7 (Degree 3) becomes vertex E
- Vertex 2 (Degree 3) becomes vertex F
- Vertex 9 (Degree 3) becomes vertex G
- Vertex 5 (Degree 2) becomes vertex H
- Vertex 8 (Degree 2) becomes vertex I
- Vertex 4 (Degree 1) becomes vertex J

Now, we will analyze the edges based on our relabeled vertices:
- A-B, A-E, A-C
- D-C, D-B, D-G
- F-E, F-I
- G-F, G-C, G-B
- H-A, H-B, H-C, H-G
- I-D, I-E

Counting the triangles:
- A-B-D, A-C-D, A-E-I, A-C-G
- B-C-G, B-D-G
- E-D-I, E-D-C

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 8>
