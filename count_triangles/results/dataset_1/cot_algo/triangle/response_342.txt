Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 3: 1 connection  
Vertex 7: 1 connection  
Vertex 4: 2 connections  
Vertex 2: 2 connections  
Vertex 6: 3 connections  
Vertex 0: 5 connections  
Vertex 1: 5 connections  
Vertex 5: 4 connections  
Vertex 8: 4 connections  
Vertex 9: 4 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles.  
Examining the edges, we find the following triangles:  
<0, 1, 8>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<0, 6, 9>  
<1, 8, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
