Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles on this graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   Vertices: 6, 0, 9, 1, 0, 9, 6, 1, 2, 0

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

3. Count the triangles by checking shared connections between vertices of each edge:
   - For edge (0, 7):
     Vertices 0 and 7 have common connections with vertices 2, 3, and 8.
     This forms the triangle <0, 2, 8>.

   - For edge (1, 3):
     Vertices 1 and 3 have a common connection with vertex 2.
     This forms the triangle <1, 2, 3>.

   - For edge (1, 5):
     Vertices 1 and 5 have a common connection with vertex 8.
     This forms the triangle <1, 5, 8>.

   - For edge (1, 8):
     Vertices 1 and 8 have common connections with vertices 2 and 3.
     This forms the triangle <1, 2, 3> and <1, 3, 8>.

   - For edge (2, 3):
     Vertices 2 and 3 have common connections with vertices 1 and 8.
     This forms the triangle <1, 2, 3> and <2, 3, 8>.

   - For the remaining edges, there are no additional unique triangles formed.

4. Count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:
   Total number of triangles: [4]
   Unique triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 3, 8>
