Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:

Vertices: (connections)
0: 3
1: 3
7: 1
8: 2
3: 2
4: 2
2: 3
5: 2
6: 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
7 -> 2
8 -> 3
3 -> 4
4 -> 5
2 -> 6
5 -> 7
6 -> 8

Next, we will examine each edge in the graph and count the triangles:
(0, 1): Share connection with 7, forms triangle <0, 1, 7>.
(0, 7): No triangles formed.
(0, 8): Share connection with 6, forms triangle <0, 8, 6>.
(1, 0): Already counted.
(1, 3): Share connection with 6, forms triangle <1, 3, 6>.
(1, 4): Share connection with 6, forms triangle <1, 4, 6>.
(2, 4): No triangles formed.
(2, 5): No triangles formed.
(2, 6): No triangles formed.
(3, 1): Already counted.
(3, 6): Share connection with 4, forms triangle <3, 6, 4>.
(4, 1): Already counted.
(4, 2): No triangles formed.
(5, 2): No triangles formed.
(5, 6): No triangles formed.
(6, 2): No triangles formed.
(6, 3): Already counted.
(6, 5): No triangles formed.
(6, 8): Share connection with 0, forms triangle <6, 8, 0>.
(7, 0): Already counted.
(8, 0): Already counted.
(8, 6): Share connection with 0, forms triangle <8, 6, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 8, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, and <8, 6, 0>.
