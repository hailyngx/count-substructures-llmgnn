Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices should be sorted based on their degrees:

Node 6: degree 0
Node 0: degree 1
Node 5: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 9: degree 6
Node 3: degree 6

Based on this ordering, we will process the edges to count the triangles:

Triangles: [<1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [4]
