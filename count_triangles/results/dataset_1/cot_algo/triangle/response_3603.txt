Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by degree, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 0 - degree 3
Node 2 - degree 2
Node 4 - degree 2
Node 6 - degree 2
Node 8 - degree 2
Node 5 - degree 2
Node 9 - degree 4
Node 3 - degree 4
Node 1 - degree 6
Node 7 - degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges in the following order:
(0, 1) --> Forms triangles with nodes 7 and 5. Triangle <0, 1, 7> and <0, 1, 5>.
(0, 5) --> Does not form a triangle.
(0, 7) --> Does not form a triangle.
(1, 2) --> Does not form a triangle.
(1, 3) --> Forms a triangle with node 9. Triangle <1, 3, 9>.
(1, 7) --> Forms a triangle with node 9. Triangle <1, 7, 9>.
(1, 9) --> Does not form a triangle.
(2, 8) --> Does not form a triangle.
(3, 4) --> Forms a triangle with node 9. Triangle <3, 4, 9>.
(3, 6) --> Does not form a triangle.
(4, 9) --> Does not form a triangle.
(5, 7) --> Does not form a triangle.
(6, 8) --> Does not form a triangle.
(7, 9) --> Does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
