Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. 

The sorted order of vertices based on their degree is: 3, 7, 6, 4, 5, 2, 1, 9, 8, 0.

Going through the edges according to the method, we find the following triangles:

1. (3, 8, 9)
2. (8, 0, 9)
3. (8, 3, 9)
4. (0, 1, 9)
5. (0, 5, 9)
6. (1, 6, 9)
7. (1, 5, 9)
8. (5, 6, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are <3, 8, 9>, <8, 0, 9>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>.
