Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  
Node 9 has 1 connection  
Node 5 has 2 connections  
Node 8 has 3 connections  
Node 2 has 3 connections  
Node 4 has 3 connections  
Node 6 has 4 connections  
Node 1 has 5 connections  
Node 0 has 5 connections  
Node 7 has 6 connections  
Node 3 has 6 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles by considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:  
- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with node 3: <0, 1, 3>  
- Edge (0, 2) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (0, 3) is already considered  
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with node 1: <0, 1, 7>  
- Edge (1, 3) is already considered  
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (1, 7) is already considered  
- Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (3, 7) is already considered  
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 4, 7>  
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (6, 7) forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 6, 7>  
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].  
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, and <1, 6, 7>.
