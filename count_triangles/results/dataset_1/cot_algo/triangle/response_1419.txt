Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0 has 1 connection
- Vertices 1 and 4 have 2 connections each
- Vertices 3 and 9 have 3 connections each
- Vertices 5 and 8 have 4 connections each
- Vertices 6 and 7 have 5 connections each

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through the edges and count the triangles formed by shared connections between vertices. 

Count of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
