Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective degrees are:
    Vertex 2: degree 0
    Vertex 8: degree 1
    Vertex 5: degree 2
    Vertex 9: degree 2
    Vertex 3: degree 2
    Vertex 4: degree 3
    Vertex 1: degree 4
    Vertex 7: degree 4
    Vertex 0: degree 5
    Vertex 6: degree 3
    
Based on the degree-based ordering, the new labels for each vertex are:
    Vertex 2: label 0
    Vertex 8: label 1
    Vertex 5: label 2
    Vertex 9: label 3
    Vertex 3: label 4
    Vertex 4: label 5
    Vertex 1: label 6
    Vertex 7: label 7
    Vertex 0: label 8
    Vertex 6: label 9
    
Now we can count the triangles:  
    - <0, 1, 7>
    - <0, 1, 5>
    - <0, 1, 8>
    - <0, 4, 6>
    - <0, 4, 7>
    - <0, 6, 5>
    - <0, 6, 7>
    - <1, 5, 7>
    - <1, 7, 9>
    - <3, 4, 9>
    - <4, 6, 7>
    - <7, 8, 9>
    
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
