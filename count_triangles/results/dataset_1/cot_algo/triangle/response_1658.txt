Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 0 -> Degree 3
Vertex 1 -> Degree 1
Vertex 7 -> Degree 1
Vertex 6 -> Degree 1
Vertex 9 -> Degree 1
Vertex 5 -> Degree 2
Vertex 8 -> Degree 2
Vertex 2 -> Degree 3
Vertex 3 -> Degree 4
Vertex 4 -> Degree 5

Now, we will iterate through the edges based on the degree-based ordering:

(1, 8): No triangle
(2, 7): No triangle
(2, 7): No triangle
(3, 0): No triangle
(6, 5): No triangle
(9, 4): No triangle
(1, 8): No triangle
(5, 0): No triangle
(7, 2): No triangle
(8, 1): No triangle
(0, 5): Triangle <0, 3, 5>
(0, 4): No triangle
(0, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 4>
(0, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 5>
(0, 4): No triangle
(2, 4): Triangle <2, 3, 4>
(2, 4): Triangle <2, 4, 7>
(2, 3): Triangle <2, 3, 4>
(2, 3): Triangle <2, 3, 5>
(3, 4): Triangle <3, 4, 8>
(3, 4): Triangle <3, 4, 9>
(3, 5): Triangle <3, 4, 5>
(4, 8): Triangle <4, 8, 1>
(4, 9): No triangle

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
