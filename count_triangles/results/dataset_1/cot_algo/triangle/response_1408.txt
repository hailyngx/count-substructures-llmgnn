Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices in ascending order of connections (Degree): 9, 8, 3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 7, 0, 4

Now, we relabel the vertices:
0 -> 0 (Degree 4)
1 -> 2 (Degree 5)
2 -> 3 (Degree 2)
3 -> 1 (Degree 3)
4 -> 6 (Degree 4)
5 -> 8 (Degree 3)
6 -> 1 (Degree 4)
7 -> 2 (Degree 5)
8 -> 3 (Degree 3)
9 -> 0 (Degree 2)

Going through the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

(0, 2):
Shared connections: 7
(0, 4):
Shared connections: 7
(0, 6):
No triangles since both vertices have the same degree
(0, 7):
Shared connections: 2, 4
(1, 2):
Shared connections: 7
(1, 3):
Shared connections: 6
(1, 6):
Shared connections: 0
(1, 7):
Shared connections: 2
(1, 8):
No triangles since both vertices have the same degree
(2, 7):
Shared connections: 1
(3, 4):
Shared connections: 9
(3, 5):
Shared connections: 1, 8
(4, 5):
Shared connections: 3
(4, 9):
Shared connections: 3
(5, 6):
Shared connections: None
(5, 8):
Shared connections: None
(6, 7):
Shared connections: 1
(7, 8):
No triangles since both vertices have the same degree
(7, 9):
Shared connections: 4

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<0, 2, 7, 1>
<0, 4, 7, 1>
<1, 3, 6, 7>
