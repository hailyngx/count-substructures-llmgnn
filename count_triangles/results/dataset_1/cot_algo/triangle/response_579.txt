Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections:  
Node 7 has 2 connections  
Node 0 has 3 connections  
Node 5 has 3 connections  
Node 6 has 3 connections  
Node 9 has 4 connections  
Node 8 has 4 connections  
Node 2 has 4 connections  
Node 1 has 5 connections  
Node 3 has 5 connections  
Node 4 has 6 connections  

We will now proceed to count the triangles by iterating through the edges based on the lower labeled node having fewer connections.  
After examining all possible triangles, the total number of triangles is [6].  
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 8, 9>.
