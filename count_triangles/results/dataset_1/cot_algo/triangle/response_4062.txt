Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

- Vertex 7 has 0 connections
- Vertices 0, 4, 6, and 7 have 1 connection each
- Vertices 2 and 8 have 2 connections each
- Vertices 1 and 5 have 5 connections each
- Vertex 9 has 6 connections
- Vertex 3 has 7 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

- Node 7 (0 connections) -> Vertex A
- Nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7 (1 connection each) -> Vertices B, C, D, E
- Nodes 2 and 8 (2 connections each) -> Vertices F, G
- Nodes 1 and 5 (5 connections each) -> Vertices H, I
- Node 9 (6 connections) -> Vertex J
- Node 3 (7 connections) -> Vertex K

Using the sorted labeling, we will now check for triangles in the graph:

- Triangle <B, D, E>
- Triangle <C, E, D>
- Triangle <F, G, I>
- Triangle <F, G, H>
- Triangle <G, K, H>
- Triangle <H, I, K>
- Triangle <H, I, J>
- Triangle <I, J, K>
- Triangle <A, E, J>
- Triangle <A, B, K>
- Triangle <B, K, D>
- Triangle <E, J, K>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
