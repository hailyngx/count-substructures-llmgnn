Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:  
Node 0 has 1 connection  
Node 4 has 1 connection  
Node 5 has 1 connection  
Node 8 has 1 connection  
Node 3 has 2 connections  
Node 2 has 2 connections  
Node 6 has 4 connections  
Node 7 has 5 connections  
Node 1 has 5 connections  
Node 9 has 5 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge in the graph with the vertex of lower label having fewer connections.  

For the given edge list:

(0, 1) forms triangles with 2 and 6  
(1, 2) forms a triangle with 9  
(1, 6) forms a triangle with 4  
(1, 7) forms triangles with 3, 6, 9  
(2, 9) does not form a triangle  
(3, 5) does not form a triangle  
(3, 7) forms triangles with 9  
(4, 6) does not form a triangle  
(7, 8) does not form a triangle  
(7, 9) forms a triangle with 6  

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>.
