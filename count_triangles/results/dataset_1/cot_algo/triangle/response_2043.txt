Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. After sorting, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 8: 6 connections

Following the degree-based ordering, we proceed with the edges in the order specified:

1. Edge (1, 2) is skipped as the vertex with the lower label already has more connections.

2. Edge (5, 8) is skipped as the vertex with the lower label already has more connections.

3. Edge (2, 1) is skipped as the vertex with the lower label already has more connections.

4. Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 7: <0, 3, 7>.

5. Edge (2, 1) is skipped as the vertex with the lower label already has more connections.

6. Edge (7, 0) forms a triangle with Node 0 and Node 9: <7, 0, 9>.

7. Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with Node 0, Node 7, and Node 8: <0, 7, 8>.

8. Edge (1, 6) is skipped as the vertex with the lower label already has more connections.

9. Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with Node 1, Node 0, and Node 8: <1, 0, 8>.

10. Edge (6, 4) is skipped as the vertex with the lower label already has more connections.

11. Edge (8, 3) is skipped as the vertex with the lower label already has more connections.

12. Edge (8, 5) is skipped as the vertex with the lower label already has more connections.

13. Edge (8, 6) forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 1: <8, 6, 1>.

14. Edge (7, 8) forms a triangle with Node 7, Node 1, and Node 0: <7, 1, 0>.

15. Edge (8, 7) forms a triangle with Node 8, Node 0, and Node 7: <8, 0, 7>.

16. Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle with Node 8, Node 0, and Node 9: <8, 0, 9>.

17. Edge (3, 0) forms a triangle with Node 3, Node 8, and Node 1: <3, 0, 1>.

18. Edge (6, 8) forms a triangle with Node 6, Node 7, and Node 1: <6, 7, 1>.

19. Edge (6, 1) forms a triangle with Node 6, Node 7, and Node 0: <6, 7, 0>.

20. Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle with Node 3, Node 6, and Node 1: <3, 6, 1>.

21. Edge (7, 8) forms a triangle with Node 7, Node 0, and Node 1: <7, 0, 1>.

22. Edge (8, 6) forms a triangle with Node 8, Node 7, and Node 1: <8, 7, 1>.

Count of triangles = 12
Total number of triangles = [12]
