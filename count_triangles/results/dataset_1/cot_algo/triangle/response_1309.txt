Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
Vertices sorted by number of connections:
Node 8: degree 0
Node 0, 1, 3, 5, 8: degree 1
Node 4, 7: degree 2
Node 2, 9: degree 4
Node 6: degree 6

Following the method, we check the edges:
1. (0, 2) - Check shared neighbors of 0 and 2: 6 
2. (0, 3) - No triangles formed
3. (0, 6) - Check shared neighbors of 0 and 6: 2
4. (1, 4) - No triangles formed
5. (1, 9) - No triangles formed
6. (2, 0) - Check shared neighbors of 2 and 0: 6
7. (2, 5) - No triangles formed
8. (2, 6) - Check shared neighbors of 2 and 6: 0
9. (2, 9) - Check shared neighbors of 2 and 9: 6
10. (3, 0) - No triangles formed
11. (4, 1) - No triangles formed
12. (4, 6) - Check shared neighbors of 4 and 6: None
13. (5, 2) - No triangles formed
14. (5, 6) - Check shared neighbors of 5 and 6: 2
15. (6, 0) - Check shared neighbors of 6 and 0: 2
16. (6, 2) - Check shared neighbors of 6 and 2: 0
17. (6, 4) - Check shared neighbors of 6 and 4: None
18. (6, 5) - Check shared neighbors of 6 and 5: 2
19. (6, 7) - No triangles formed
20. (7, 6) - No triangles formed
21. (7, 9) - No triangles formed
22. (9, 1) - No triangles formed
23. (9, 2) - Check shared neighbors of 9 and 2: 6
24. (9, 7) - No triangles formed

Total number of triangles: [3] 
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 6>.
