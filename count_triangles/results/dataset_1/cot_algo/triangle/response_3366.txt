Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted list based on the given edges is:
Vertices: 2, 8, 6, 4, 5, 1, 7, 9, 3, 0

Using this ordering, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <3, 4, 7>
6. <3, 7, 9>
7. <5, 6, 8>
8. <6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
