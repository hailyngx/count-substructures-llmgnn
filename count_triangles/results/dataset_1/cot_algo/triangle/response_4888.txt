Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices with their corresponding degrees is as follows:
Vertex 1 - Degree 3
Vertex 6 - Degree 3
Vertex 7 - Degree 3
Vertex 8 - Degree 3
Vertex 2 - Degree 4
Vertex 4 - Degree 4
Vertex 5 - Degree 4
Vertex 9 - Degree 4
Vertex 3 - Degree 5

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph, considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will count the number of triangles formed by the shared connections.

After analyzing the graph, we find the following triangles:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
