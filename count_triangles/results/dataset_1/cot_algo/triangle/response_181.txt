Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 8, 1, 5, 4, 6, 7, 3, 0, 9, 2.

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the graph, we find:
- Triangles: <0, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
