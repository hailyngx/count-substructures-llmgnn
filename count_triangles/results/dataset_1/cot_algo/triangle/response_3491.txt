Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

- The vertices sorted by the number of connections from least to most are: 1, 7, 0, 4, 8, 3, 6, 9, 5, 2.

- Considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
    - Edge (0, 2) (Considering vertex 0): Forms the triangle <0, 2, 5>.
    - Edge (0, 8) (Considering vertex 0): No triangle formed.
    - Edge (2, 5) (Considering vertex 2): No triangle formed.
    - Edge (2, 6) (Considering vertex 2): No triangle formed.
    - Edge (2, 9) (Considering vertex 2): Forms the triangle <2, 5, 9>.
    - Edge (3, 5) (Considering vertex 3): No triangle formed.
    - Edge (3, 7) (Considering vertex 3): No triangle formed.
    - Edge (4, 5) (Considering vertex 4): Forms the triangle <4, 5, 9>.
    - Edge (5, 8) (Considering vertex 5): No triangle formed.
    - Edge (6, 9) (Considering vertex 6): No triangle formed.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, and <4, 5, 9>.
