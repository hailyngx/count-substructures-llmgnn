Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their degree are: 
Vertices: 7, 8, 9, 5, 3, 1, 0, 2, 6, 4 

Calculating the number of triangles: 
1. Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with vertices 0, 2, and a shared connection vertex. 
2. Edge (0, 5) does not form a triangle. 
3. Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with vertices 0, 6, and a shared connection vertex. 
4. Edge (1, 2) does not form a triangle. 
5. Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle. 
6. Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle with vertices 1, 6, and a shared connection vertex. 
7. Edge (2, 0) does not form a triangle. 
8. Edge (2, 1) does not form a triangle. 
9. Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle. 
10. Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle. 
11. Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle. 
12. Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle. 
13. Edge (4, 3) does not form a triangle. 
14. Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle. 
15. Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle. 
16. Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle. 
17. Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle. 
18. Edge (6, 0) does not form a triangle. 
19. Edge (6, 1) does not form a triangle. 
20. Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle. 
21. Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle. 
22. Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle. 
23. Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle. 
24. Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle. 
25. Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle. 
26. Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle. 

Count of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 6> <1, 2, 6> <4, 8, 9>
