Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 1: degree 2  
Node 2: degree 2  
Node 3: degree 2  
Node 4: degree 1  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 1  
Node 7: degree 1  
Node 8: degree 2  
Node 9: degree 2  

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 4 (degree 1) -> Node 0  
Node 6 (degree 1) -> Node 1  
Node 7 (degree 1) -> Node 2  
Node 1 (degree 2) -> Node 3  
Node 2 (degree 2) -> Node 4  
Node 3 (degree 2) -> Node 5  
Node 8 (degree 2) -> Node 6  
Node 9 (degree 2) -> Node 7  
Node 5 (degree 4) -> Node 8  

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

For the edge (1, 5):
Node 1 and Node 5 have a shared connection with Node 4, forming a triangle: <0, 3, 4>

For the edge (2, 5):
Node 2 and Node 5 have a shared connection with Node 8, forming a triangle: <4, 2, 8>

For the edge (3, 8):
No triangles are formed.

For the edge (4, 5):
Node 4 and Node 5 have a shared connection with Node 1, forming a triangle: <3, 4, 0>

For the edge (5, 1):
Already counted.

For the edge (5, 2):
Already counted.

For the edge (5, 4):
Already counted.

For the edge (5, 8):
Node 5 and Node 8 have a shared connection with Node 2, forming a triangle: <0, 4, 8>

For the edge (6, 9):
No triangles are formed.

For the edge (7, 9):
No triangles are formed.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
