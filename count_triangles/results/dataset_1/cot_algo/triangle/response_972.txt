Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 4 has degree 0
- Nodes 6 and 7 have degree 1
- Nodes 0, 3, and 6 have degree 2
- Nodes 2 and 8 have degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 5

Next, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Node 4 (0 degree) becomes node 0
- Nodes 6 and 7 (1 degree) become nodes 1 and 2
- Nodes 0, 3, and 6 (2 degree) become nodes 3, 4, and 5
- Nodes 2 and 8 (3 degree) become nodes 6 and 7
- Node 1 (4 degree) becomes node 8
- Node 5 (5 degree) becomes node 9

Now, we will list the triangles based on the connections:
- Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle <1, 8, 5>
- Triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle <2, 6, 5>
- Triangle <3, 7, 5>
- Triangle <3, 8, 5>
- Triangle <6, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
