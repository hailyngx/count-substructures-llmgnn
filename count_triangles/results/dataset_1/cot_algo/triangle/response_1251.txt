Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on the number of connections:

Node 3: 1 connection   
Node 7: 1 connection   
Node 9: 1 connection   
Node 0: 2 connections   
Node 2: 3 connections   
Node 8: 3 connections   
Node 1: 4 connections   
Node 4: 4 connections   
Node 6: 4 connections   
Node 5: 5 connections   

Next, we will count the triangles by examining the edges in order:

1. (0, 8): No triangles formed.
2. (1, 5): Triangles <1, 5, 4> and <1, 5, 6>.
3. (1, 6): No triangles formed.
4. (2, 4): No triangles formed.
5. (2, 6): No triangles formed.
6. (3, 7): No triangles formed.
7. (4, 2): No triangles formed.
8. (4, 5): No triangles formed.
9. (5, 1): No triangles formed.
10. (5, 4): No triangles formed.
11. (5, 9): No triangles formed.
12. (6, 1): No triangles formed.
13. (6, 2): No triangles formed.
14. (6, 8): Triangle <6, 8, 0>.
15. (7, 3): No triangles formed.
16. (8, 0): No triangles formed.
17. (8, 6): No triangles formed.
18. (9, 5): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <1, 5, 4> and <1, 5, 6>.
