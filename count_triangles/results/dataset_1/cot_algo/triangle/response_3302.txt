Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of connections each node has:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we'll relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 4: 1 connection -> Node A
- Node 0: 2 connections -> Node B
- Node 1: 2 connections -> Node C
- Node 3: 2 connections -> Node D
- Node 6: 2 connections -> Node E
- Node 8: 2 connections -> Node F
- Node 2: 4 connections -> Node G
- Node 9: 4 connections -> Node H
- Node 5: 5 connections -> Node I

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:

Triangles:
1. <A, B, I>
2. <A, E, I>
3. <B, A, I>
4. <B, C, G>
5. <D, I, E>
6. <E, I, G>
7. <E, B, I>
8. <F, G, H>
9. <F, G, I>
10. <G, I, H>
11. <G, I, C>
12. <H, G, I>

Total number of triangles: [12]
