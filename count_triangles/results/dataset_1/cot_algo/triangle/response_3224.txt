Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 6 connections

Now, we will start counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Calculating the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 2, 1>
2. Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 0 and 4: <0, 4, 9>
3. Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 0 and 9: <0, 9, 4>
4. Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <1, 2, 0>
5. Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 2 and 3: <2, 3, 7>
7. Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
8. Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 2 and 8: <2, 8, 4>
10. Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle.
11. Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
12. Edge (4, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 4 and 8: <4, 8, 9>
13. Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle.
14. Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
15. Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
16. Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 8 and 9: <8, 9, 4>

Total number of triangles: [6]
