Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then we relabel the vertices accordingly.

Sorted vertices: <4, 8, 5, 1, 2, 7, 9, 0, 3, 6>

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles formed by each edge. We will only count a triangle once by making sure that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

There are 5 triangles in this graph:

[5]  
<0, 3, 6>  
<0, 6, 8>  
<1, 5, 6>  
<2, 3, 6>  
<5, 6, 7>
