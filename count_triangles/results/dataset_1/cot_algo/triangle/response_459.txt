Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeled list: 

Nodes: 3, 5, 8, 1, 7, 4, 6, 0, 9, 2

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph:

1. For edge (0, 2):
   - Node 0 (degree 3): Connections with nodes 2, 6, 9
   - Node 2 (degree 4): Connections with nodes 0, 1, 6, 7
   - Shared connections: Node 6
   Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>

2. For edge (0, 6):
   - Node 0 (degree 3): Connections with nodes 2, 6, 9
   - Node 6 (degree 4): Connections with nodes 0, 2, 4, 7
   - Shared connections: Node 2
   Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>

3. For edge (0, 9):
   - Node 0 (degree 3): Connections with nodes 2, 6, 9
   - Node 9 (degree 4): Connections with nodes 0, 4, 5, 8
   - No shared connections

[Total number of triangles: 2]
