Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling them from 0 to 9 accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections is:  
1. Vertex 5: 1 connection  
2. Vertex 8: 1 connection  
3. Vertex 9: 1 connection  
4. Vertex 4: 1 connection  
5. Vertex 6: 2 connections  
6. Vertex 1: 3 connections  
7. Vertex 2: 3 connections  
8. Vertex 5: 3 connections  
9. Vertex 0: 5 connections  
10. Vertex 7: 6 connections  

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge in the graph:

For the edge (0, 2):  
- Shared connections with 0: 3, 7  
- Triangle found: <0, 2, 7>  

For the edge (0, 3):  
- Shared connections with 0: 2, 4, 7  
- Triangle found: <0, 3, 2>  

For the edge (0, 4):  
- Shared connections with 0: None  

For the edge (0, 7):  
- Shared connections with 0: 2, 3  
- Triangle found: <0, 7, 2>  

For the edge (0, 9):  
- Shared connections with 0: None  

For the edge (1, 3):  
- Shared connections with 1: 5, 7  
- Triangle found: <1, 3, 5>  

For the edge (1, 5):  
- Shared connections with 1: 3  
- Triangle found: None  

For the edge (1, 7):  
- Shared connections with 1: 3  
- Triangle found: None  

For the edge (1, 8):  
- Shared connections with 1: None  

For the edge (2, 6):  
- Shared connections with 2: None  

For the edge (2, 7):  
- Shared connections with 2: 0  
- Triangle found: None  

For the edge (3, 5):  
- Shared connections with 3: 1  
- Triangle found: None  

For the edge (3, 6):  
- Shared connections with 3: None  

For the edge (3, 7):  
- Shared connections with 3: 0, 2  
- Triangle found: <3, 0, 7>  

For the edge (4, 6):  
- Shared connections with 4: None  

For the edge (7, 8):  
- Shared connections with 7: None  

For the edge (7, 9):  
- Shared connections with 7: None  

After examining all edges, the total number of triangles is [3].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 5>.
