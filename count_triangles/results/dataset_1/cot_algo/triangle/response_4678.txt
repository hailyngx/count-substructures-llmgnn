Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees in non-decreasing order, the vertices are relabeled as follows:  

Node 5: 1 connection  
Node 7: 2 connections  
Node 1: 2 connections  
Node 9: 1 connection  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 6: 4 connections  
Node 3: 5 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles in the graph:

Triangles: [18]  
Unique triangles:  
<0, 3, 6>  
<0, 3, 8>  
<0, 6, 8>  
<1, 3, 4>  
<2, 3, 4>  
<3, 6, 0>  
<3, 6, 8>  
<3, 8, 0>  
<3, 8, 6>  
<4, 3, 1>  
<4, 3, 2>  
<5, 4, 1>  
<5, 4, 2>  
<6, 3, 0>  
<6, 3, 8>  
<6, 7, 5>  
<6, 8, 0>  
<7, 5, 4>
