Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes and their connections:
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections

Next, we relabel the nodes based on their connections:
- Node 5: 0 connections (Now Node 0)
- Node 0: 3 connections (Now Node 1)
- Node 5: 1 connection (Now Node 2)
- Node 9: 4 connections (Now Node 3)
- Node 3: 4 connections (Now Node 4)
- Node 2: 4 connections (Now Node 5)
- Node 6: 4 connections (Now Node 6)
- Node 1: 4 connections (Now Node 7)
- Node 7: 4 connections (Now Node 8)
- Node 4: 4 connections (Now Node 9)

Now, we will count the triangles present in the graph:
- Triangles: [<0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
