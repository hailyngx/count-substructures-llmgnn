Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are:  
0 -> 3 connections  
1 -> 0 connections  
2 -> 4 connections  
3 -> 6 connections  
4 -> 5 connections  
5 -> 2 connections  
6 -> 4 connections  
7 -> 4 connections  
8 -> 4 connections  
9 -> 3 connections  

Now, we can list the triangles based on the shared connections:
<0, 3, 4>  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 4, 6>  
<2, 3, 8>  
<2, 3, 9>  
<3, 4, 6>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<3, 6, 7>  
<3, 6, 8>  
<3, 7, 9>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<6, 7, 8>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
