Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:

0 - 2 connections
4 - 2 connections
9 - 2 connections
7 - 4 connections
8 - 4 connections
6 - 4 connections
5 - 5 connections
2 - 5 connections
1 - 5 connections
3 - 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the graph are:
