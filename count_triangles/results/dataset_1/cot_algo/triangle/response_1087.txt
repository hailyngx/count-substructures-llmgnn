Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the new adjacency list is as follows:
0: [1]
1: [0, 2, 8]
2: [1, 4, 6, 7]
3: [4, 5]
4: [2, 3, 9]
5: [3, 8, 9]
6: [2, 7, 8]
7: [2, 6]
8: [1, 5, 6, 9]
9: [4, 5, 8]

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles.

There are 7 triangles in total as follows:
1. <2, 6, 7>
2. <2, 6, 8>
3. <2, 7, 8>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <5, 8, 9>
6. <6, 7, 8>
7. <8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
