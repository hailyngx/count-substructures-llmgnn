Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices can be sorted as follows:
Vertex 5 has 2 connections.
Vertex 6 has 2 connections.
Vertex 2 has 2 connections.
Vertex 8 has 3 connections.
Vertex 9 has 4 connections.
Vertex 1 has 4 connections.
Vertex 4 has 4 connections.
Vertex 0 has 4 connections.
Vertex 7 has 5 connections.
Vertex 3 has 5 connections.

Using the sorted vertices to analyze the edges, we find the following triangles:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
