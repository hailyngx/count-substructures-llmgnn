Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 3 has degree 1
Node 4 has degree 1
Node 7 has degree 1
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 4

Now, we will check each edge starting from the one with the lower label:

Edge (0, 2):
Node 0 and Node 2 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (0, 5):
Node 0 and Node 5 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (1, 5):
Node 1 and Node 5 form a triangle with Node 0.

Edge (1, 6):
Node 1 and Node 6 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (2, 0):
Node 0 and Node 2 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (2, 8):
Node 2 and Node 8 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (3, 7):
Node 3 and Node 7 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (4, 6):
Node 4 and Node 6 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (5, 0):
Node 0 and Node 5 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (5, 1):
Node 1 and Node 5 form a triangle with Node 0.

Edge (6, 1):
Node 1 and Node 6 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (6, 4):
Node 4 and Node 6 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (6, 9):
Node 6 and Node 9 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (7, 3):
Node 3 and Node 7 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (8, 2):
Node 2 and Node 8 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (8, 9):
Node 8 and Node 9 do not have any shared connections.

Edge (9, 6):
Node 6 and Node 9 form a triangle with Node 1.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <1, 6, 9>
