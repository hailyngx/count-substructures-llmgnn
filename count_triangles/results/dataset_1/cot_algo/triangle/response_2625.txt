Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0: 1 connections
Node 4: 1 connections
Node 5: 1 connections
Node 7: 1 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check for triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 3]
Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
