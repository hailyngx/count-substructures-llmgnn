Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection

Now, we relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 1 → 1
Vertex 2 → 2
Vertex 3 → 3
Vertex 4 → 6
Vertex 5 → 9
Vertex 6 → 4
Vertex 7 → 5
Vertex 8 → 8
Vertex 9 → 7

Now, we examine each edge based on the vertices' labels and degree to count the triangles:
1. (1, 5): No triangle
2. (2, 4): No triangle
3. (2, 6): No triangle
4. (3, 8): No triangle
5. (4, 2): No triangle
6. (4, 5): <4, 9, 5>
7. (4, 9): No triangle
8. (5, 1): No triangle
9. (5, 4): Already counted
10. (5, 7): <5, 9, 7>
11. (5, 8): <5, 9, 8>
12. (6, 2): No triangle
13. (6, 8): <6, 4, 8>
14. (7, 5): Already counted
15. (7, 8): <7, 5, 8>
16. (8, 3): No triangle
17. (8, 5): Already counted
18. (8, 6): Already counted
19. (8, 7): Already counted
20. (9, 4): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles:
<4, 9, 5>
<5, 9, 7>
<5, 9, 8>
<6, 4, 8>
