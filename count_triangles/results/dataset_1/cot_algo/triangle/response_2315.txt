Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 2 -> A
Node 0 -> B
Node 1 -> C
Node 6 -> D
Node 7 -> E
Node 8 -> F
Node 9 -> G
Node 3 -> H
Node 5 -> I
Node 4 -> J

Next, we will check the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (A, E): Forms triangle with node C <A, E, C>
- Edge (A, J): No triangle formed
- Edge (B, J): No triangle formed
- Edge (C, H): Forms triangle with nodes I and J <C, H, I>
- Edge (D, E): Forms triangle with node H <D, E, H>
- Edge (D, F): Forms triangle with node H <D, F, H>
- Edge (E, F): No triangle formed
- Edge (G, I): No triangle formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
