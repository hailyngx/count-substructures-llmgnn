Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. After relabeling the vertices accordingly, the graph looks like this:

Nodes in decreasing order of degree:
(0, 5) --> 4 connections
(1, 4, 9) --> 3 connections
(2, 6, 8) --> 2 connections
(3, 7) --> 1 connection

Using the degree-based ordering, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph.

Number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
