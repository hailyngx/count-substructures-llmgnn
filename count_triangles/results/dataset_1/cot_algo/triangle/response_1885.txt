Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: <3, 5, 6, 9, 1, 2, 0, 4, 8, 7>. 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <2, 4, 6>
6. <2, 4, 7>
7. <2, 6, 9>
8. <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
