Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 7: degree 1
Node 6: degree 1
Node 0: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 9: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5

Using the degree-based ordering method to count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 3): 0 and 3 share a connection with 4, forming triangle <0, 3, 4>.
- Edge (0, 4): 0 and 4 share a connection with 3, forming triangle <0, 4, 3>.
- Edge (1, 5): 1 and 5 share a connection with 8, forming triangle <1, 5, 8>.
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 5): 2 and 5 share a connection with 3, forming triangle <2, 5, 3>.
- Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 0): Already counted.
- Edge (3, 4): Already counted.
- Edge (3, 5): 3 and 5 share a connection with 1, forming triangle <3, 5, 1>.
- Edge (3, 9): 3 and 9 share a connection with 4, forming triangle <3, 9, 4>.
- Edge (4, 0): Already counted.
- Edge (4, 3): Already counted.
- Edge (4, 9): 4 and 9 share a connection with 3, forming triangle <4, 9, 3>.
- Edge (5, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (5, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (5, 3): Already counted.
- Edge (5, 8): 5 and 8 share a connection with 1, forming triangle <5, 8, 1>.
- Edge (6, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (8, 5): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 3): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 4): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
Unique triangles are: <0, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 3>, <3, 5, 1>, <4, 9, 3>.
