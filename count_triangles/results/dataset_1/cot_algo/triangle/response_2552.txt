Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections (degrees):

Nodes sorted by degree: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 0, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 7, 5, 8, 6

Now we relabel the nodes accordingly: 
Node 0 (degree 2) is relabeled as 0
Node 1 (degree 2) is relabeled as 1
Node 2 (degree 4) is relabeled as 2
Node 3 (degree 3) is relabeled as 3
Node 4 (degree 2) is relabeled as 4
Node 5 (degree 2) is relabeled as 5
Node 6 (degree 2) is relabeled as 6
Node 7 (degree 2) is relabeled as 7
Node 9 (degree 5) is relabeled as 8

The edges we are considering are: (0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 7), (4, 9), (5, 0), (6, 9), (7, 3), (7, 9), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 7).

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the relabeled vertices:

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 5, 2>
4. <2, 3, 7>
5. <7, 9, 4>
6. <9, 4, 6>
7. <9, 4, 7>
8. <9, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [8]
