Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are:  
Node 5 - Degree: 2  
Node 6 - Degree: 1  
Node 2 - Degree: 2  
Node 9 - Degree: 3  
Node 7 - Degree: 3  
Node 4 - Degree: 3  
Node 3 - Degree: 4  
Node 1 - Degree: 4  
Node 0 - Degree: 6  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- Start with the edge (0, 1): Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 1. Check for shared connections.
  - Node 3 is a shared connection, forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- Move to the edge (0, 3): Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 3. Check for shared connections.
  - Node 1 is a shared connection, forming a triangle <0, 3, 1>.
  - Node 5 is a shared connection, forming a triangle <0, 3, 5>.
- Move to the edge (0, 5): Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 5. Check for shared connections.
  - No triangles are formed with this edge.
- Continue this process for all edges.

After examining all edges, we find the following unique triangles:  
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 3, 1>  
<0, 3, 5>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
