Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree):
Vertices: 5 (3 connections), 0 (2 connections), 8 (1 connection), 6 (5 connections), 1 (4 connections), 9 (4 connections), 7 (4 connections), 3 (6 connections), 4 (6 connections), 2 (6 connections)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the edges to consider are: 
(0, 6), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 9), (9, 2), (9, 4)

Number of triangles: 12
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 9, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <6, 4, 7>
