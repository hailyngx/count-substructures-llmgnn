Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given graph after sorting the vertices based on their degrees: 

Node 7: Deg 2
Node 0: Deg 2
Node 9: Deg 2
Node 4: Deg 2
Node 1: Deg 3
Node 3: Deg 3
Node 8: Deg 3
Node 6: Deg 4
Node 5: Deg 6
Node 2: Deg 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
