Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Degree of each vertex:
0: 2
1: 0
2: 4
3: 2
4: 4
5: 2
6: 3
7: 2
8: 4
9: 1

Sorted vertices based on degree:
1 (0 degree): 1
9 (1 degree): 9
0, 3, 5, 7 (2 degree): 0, 3, 5, 7
6 (3 degree): 6
2, 4, 8 (4 degree): 2, 4, 8

Now, we will label the vertices accordingly:
1: 1
9: 2
0: 3
3: 4
5: 5
7: 6
6: 7
2: 8
4: 9
8: 10

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:
(0, 6): None
(2, 4): <0, 2, 4>
(2, 5): None
(2, 6): <0, 2, 6>
(2, 9): None
(3, 5): None
(4, 2): Already counted
(4, 7): None
(4, 8): <0, 4, 8>
(5, 2): Already counted
(5, 3): None
(6, 0): None
(6, 2): Already counted
(6, 8): <0, 6, 8>
(7, 4): None
(7, 8): None
(8, 4): Already counted
(8, 6): Already counted
(8, 7): None
(9, 2): None

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
