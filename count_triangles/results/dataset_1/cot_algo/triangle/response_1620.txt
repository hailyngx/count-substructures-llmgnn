Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes sorted by their degrees are as follows:
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found in the graph are:
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 6, 1>
- <0, 6, 4>
- <0, 6, 5>
- <0, 6, 2>
- <1, 6, 2>
- <1, 6, 5>
- <1, 6, 4>
- <1, 6, 0>
- <2, 6, 4>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <4, 8, 5>
- <8, 7, 1>
- <8, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
