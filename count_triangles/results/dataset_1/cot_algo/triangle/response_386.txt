Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
- Node 5 has 1 connection
- Nodes 6 and 9 have 2 connections
- Nodes 3 and 6 have 3 connections
- Nodes 4, 2, and 9 have 4 connections
- Nodes 1 and 8 have 5 connections
- Node 0 has 7 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Node 5 -> 0
- Nodes 6 and 9 -> 1
- Nodes 3 and 6 -> 2
- Nodes 4, 2, and 9 -> 3
- Nodes 1 and 8 -> 4
- Node 0 -> 5

Next, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- (3, 4) shares node 0 -> <3, 4, 0>
- (1, 8) shares node 0 -> <1, 8, 0>
- (1, 9) shares node 4 -> <1, 9, 4>
- (4, 6) shares node 0 -> <4, 6, 0>
- (2, 7) shares node 0 -> <2, 7, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
