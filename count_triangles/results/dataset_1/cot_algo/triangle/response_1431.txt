Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Node 3 (Degree 1) 
Node 4 (Degree 2) 
Node 1 (Degree 0) 
Node 6 (Degree 3) 
Node 0 (Degree 6) 
Node 5 (Degree 4) 
Node 2 (Degree 4) 
Node 7 (Degree 4) 
Node 8 (Degree 4) 
Node 9 (Degree 5)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles:

Edges to consider: (3, 8), (0, 6), (6, 7)

Triangles: 
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [2]
