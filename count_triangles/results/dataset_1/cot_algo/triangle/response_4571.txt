Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted as follows: 
Vertices: 7, 8, 6, 1, 5, 4, 2, 6, 0, 3

Calculating triangles:

- For edge (0, 3): 0 connects with 2 and 9, 3 connects with 2, 5, 9 -> Triangle formed: <0, 3, 2>
- For edge (0, 9): 0 connects with 3, 9 connects with 4, 7 -> No triangle formed
- For edge (1, 4): 1 connects with 5, 4 connects with 9 -> No triangle formed
- For edge (1, 5): 1 connects with 4, 5 connects with 1, 3 -> No triangle formed
- For edge (2, 3): 2 connects with 3, 8, 8 connects with 2 -> No triangle formed
- For edge (2, 8): 2 connects with 3, 8 connects with 2 -> No triangle formed
- For edge (3, 0): Already counted
- For edge (3, 2): Already counted
- For edge (3, 5): Already counted
- For edge (4, 1): Already counted
- For edge (4, 9): Already counted
- For edge (5, 1): Already counted
- For edge (5, 3): Already counted
- For edge (7, 9): 7 connects with 9 -> No triangle formed
- For edge (8, 2): Already counted
- For edge (9, 0): Already counted
- For edge (9, 4): Already counted
- For edge (9, 7): Already counted

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 2>
