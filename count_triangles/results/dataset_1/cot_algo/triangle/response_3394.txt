Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Nodes 5 and 8: degree 1
Nodes 4, 6, and 7: degree 3
Nodes 1 and 2: degree 4
Node 9: degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph:

<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 0, 9>
<6, 3, 9>
<9, 8, 5>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
