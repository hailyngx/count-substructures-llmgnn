Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections in ascending order, the new labeling will be: 0 (degree 3), 3 (degree 3), 6 (degree 3), 1 (degree 4), 4 (degree 4), 7 (degree 4), 8 (degree 5), 9 (degree 4), 2 (degree 6), 5 (degree 8).

Using the degree-based ordering method, we can count the number of triangles formed in the graph:

\[ [12] \]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
