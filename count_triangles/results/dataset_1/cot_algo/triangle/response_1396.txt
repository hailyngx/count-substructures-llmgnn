Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 0 with 1 connection
Vertex 1 with 1 connection
Vertex 6 with 2 connections
Vertex 9 with 2 connections
Vertex 7 with 2 connections
Vertex 8 with 2 connections
Vertex 5 with 3 connections
Vertex 4 with 4 connections
Vertex 3 with 4 connections
Vertex 2 with 6 connections

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the appropriate edges, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Triangles formed by edge (0, 5):
   - Shared connections: None

2. Triangles formed by edge (1, 6):
   - Shared connections: None

3. Triangles formed by edge (2, 4):
   - Shared connections: None

4. Triangles formed by edge (2, 7):
   - Shared connections: None

5. Triangles formed by edge (2, 8):
   - Shared connections: None

6. Triangles formed by edge (3, 4):
   - Shared connections: None

7. Triangles formed by edge (3, 5):
   - Shared connections: None

8. Triangles formed by edge (3, 9):
   - Shared connections: None

9. Triangles formed by edge (4, 2):
   - Shared connections: None

10. Triangles formed by edge (4, 3):
   - Shared connections: Vertex 5
   - Triangle: <3, 4, 5>

11. Triangles formed by edge (4, 5):
   - Shared connections: None

12. Triangles formed by edge (5, 0):
   - Shared connections: None

13. Triangles formed by edge (5, 3):
   - Shared connections: None

14. Triangles formed by edge (5, 4):
   - Shared connections: None

15. Triangles formed by edge (6, 1):
   - Shared connections: None

16. Triangles formed by edge (6, 9):
   - Shared connections: None

17. Triangles formed by edge (7, 2):
   - Shared connections: None

18. Triangles formed by edge (7, 8):
   - Shared connections: None

19. Triangles formed by edge (8, 2):
   - Shared connections: None

20. Triangles formed by edge (8, 7):
   - Shared connections: None

21. Triangles formed by edge (9, 3):
   - Shared connections: None

22. Triangles formed by edge (9, 6):
   - Shared connections: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1], and the unique triangles found are <3, 4, 5>.
