Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
- Vertex 0 has 5 connections
- Vertex 3 has 2 connections
- Vertex 2 has 3 connections
- Vertex 5 has 3 connections
- Vertex 6 has 5 connections
- Vertex 7 has 2 connections
- Vertex 1 has 4 connections
- Vertex 8 has 2 connections
- Vertex 4 has 4 connections
- Vertex 9 has 2 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now examine the edges based on the labels of the vertices involved:

- Edge (0, 2): Forms triangle with 2, 4. 
- Edge (0, 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (0, 4): Forms triangle with 4, 1.
- Edge (0, 5): Forms triangle with 5, 6.
- Edge (0, 6): Forms triangle with 6, 1 and 6, 4. 
- Edge (1, 2): Forms triangle with 2, 4.
- Edge (1, 4): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 6): Forms triangle with 6, 4.
- Edge (1, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 6): Forms triangle with 6, 4.
- Edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 5): Forms triangle with 5, 7.
- Edge (7, 8) : No triangle formed.

This gives a total of 9 triangles. 

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 4, 1>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 6, 4>, <6, 2, 4>, <6, 1, 4>, <5, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 6>.
