Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 2: 0 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 2 (0 connections) -> Node 0
Node 6 (0 connections) -> Node 1
Node 7 (0 connections) -> Node 2
Node 0 (2 connections) -> Node 3
Node 1 (2 connections) -> Node 4
Node 5 (2 connections) -> Node 5
Node 9 (2 connections) -> Node 6
Node 3 (3 connections) -> Node 7
Node 8 (3 connections) -> Node 8
Node 4 (4 connections) -> Node 9

Now, we will count the triangles:

- (0, 1) forms a triangle with node 4: <0, 1, 4>
- (0, 4) forms a triangle with node 3: <0, 3, 4>
- (1, 0) not counted as 1 is labeled after 0
- (1, 4) forms a triangle with node 3: <1, 3, 4>
- (3, 4) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 3, 4>
- (3, 5) not counted as 5 is labeled after 3
- (4, 0) not counted as 0 is labeled after 4
- (4, 1) not counted as 1 is labeled after 4
- (4, 3) not counted as 3 is labeled after 4
- (4, 8) forms a triangle with node 9: <4, 8, 9>
- (5, 3) not counted as 3 is labeled after 5
- (8, 4) not counted as 4 is labeled after 8
- (8, 9) not counted as 9 is labeled after 8
- (9, 8) not counted as 8 is labeled after 9

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 4>
