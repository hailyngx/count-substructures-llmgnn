Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now find the number of triangles. 

[Total number of triangles: 2]
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 7>
