Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given graph with Degree-Based Ordering:
Nodes sorted by number of connections: 3, 7, 4, 8, 0, 5, 6, 2, 1, 9
Relabeled nodes:  
Node 3 --> A  
Node 7 --> B  
Node 4 --> C  
Node 8 --> D  
Node 0 --> E  
Node 5 --> F  
Node 6 --> G  
Node 2 --> H  
Node 1 --> I  
Node 9 --> J  

Edges in the new labeling:   
(E, I), (E, F), (E, J), (I, E), (I, H), (I, F), (I, G), (I, D), (I, J), (H, I), (H, C), (H, G), (H, J), (A, C), (A, J), (C, H), (C, A), (C, F), (F, E), (F, I), (F, C), (F, B), (G, I), (G, H), (G, J), (B, F), (D, I), (D, J), (J, E), (J, I), (J, H), (J, A), (J, D)  

Triangles found:  
<F, I, C>
