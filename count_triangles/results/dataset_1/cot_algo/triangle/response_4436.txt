Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 5: degree 2
Node 0: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 0
Node 4: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 0

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we look at each edge with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections.

Considering each edge:
(0, 8): No triangles.
(1, 2): No triangles.
(1, 4): No triangles.
(1, 5): No triangles.
(2, 1): No triangles.
(4, 1): No triangles.
(4, 7): No triangles.
(5, 1): No triangles.
(5, 6): Unique triangle found: <1, 5, 6>.
(6, 5): No triangles.
(6, 7): No triangles.
(7, 4): No triangles.
(7, 6): No triangles.
(7, 8): No triangles.
(8, 0): No triangles.
(8, 7): Unique triangle found: <6, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
