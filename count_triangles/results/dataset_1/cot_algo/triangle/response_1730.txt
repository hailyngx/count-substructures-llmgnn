Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to arrange the vertices by their degree in ascending order. 

Vertex 3 has degree 2,
Vertices 2, 4, and 7 have degree 3,
Vertices 1, 5, and 8 have degree 4,
Vertices 0 and 6 have degree 5, and
Vertex 9 has degree 6.

Therefore, the new vertex labels will be:
3 → 0
2 → 1
4 → 2
7 → 3
1 → 4
5 → 5
8 → 6
0 → 7
6 → 8
9 → 9

Now, we examine each edge starting with the one pertaining to the vertex with the lower label to determine if a triangle is formed.

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 6, 8>
3. <0, 9, 6>
4. <1, 2, 5>
5. <1, 6, 4>
6. <2, 5, 3>
7. <4, 6, 8>
8. <6, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
