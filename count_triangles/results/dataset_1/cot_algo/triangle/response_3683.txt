Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree of connections from least to most, we get the following labels:
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 6
Node 0: Degree 6

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge between nodes 0 and 6: Node 6 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 8. Triangle <0, 6, 8>.
2. Edge between nodes 0 and 8: Node 8 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 5. Triangle <0, 8, 5>.
3. Edge between nodes 0 and 9: Node 0 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 6 and 9. Triangle <0, 9, 6>.
4. Edge between nodes 1 and 4: Both nodes have the same degree, so no triangle is formed.
5. Edge between nodes 2 and 3: Both nodes have the same degree, so no triangle is formed.
6. Edge between nodes 2 and 9: Node 2 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 3 and 9. Triangle <2, 9, 3>.
7. Edge between nodes 3 and 2: Node 2 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 9 and 2. Triangle <3, 2, 9>.
8. Edge between nodes 4 and 1: Node 1 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 4 and 7. Triangle <1, 4, 7>.
9. Edge between nodes 4 and 6: Node 6 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 4. Triangle <4, 6, 0>.
10. Edge between nodes 4 and 7: Node 7 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 4 and 5. Triangle <4, 7, 5>.
11. Edge between nodes 5 and 7: Node 7 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 4 and 5. Triangle <5, 7, 4>.
12. Edge between nodes 5 and 8: Node 8 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 5. Triangle <8, 5, 0>.
13. Edge between nodes 6 and 0: Node 0 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 8 and 6. Triangle <6, 0, 8>.
14. Edge between nodes 6 and 4: Node 4 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 6. Triangle <6, 4, 0>.
15. Edge between nodes 6 and 9: Node 6 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 9. Triangle <6, 9, 0>.
16. Edge between nodes 7 and 4: Node 4 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 1 and 7. Triangle <7, 4, 1>.
17. Edge between nodes 7 and 5: Node 5 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 4 and 7. Triangle <7, 5, 4>.
18. Edge between nodes 8 and 0: Node 0 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 8 and 5. Triangle <8, 0, 5>.
19. Edge between nodes 8 and 5: Node 5 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 8. Triangle <8, 5, 0>.
20. Edge between nodes 9 and 0: Node 0 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 6 and 9. Triangle <9, 0, 6>.
21. Edge between nodes 9 and 2: Node 2 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 3 and 9. Triangle <9, 2, 3>.
22. Edge between nodes 9 and 6: Node 6 has fewer connections, forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 9. Triangle <9, 6, 0>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [22] inside brackets.
