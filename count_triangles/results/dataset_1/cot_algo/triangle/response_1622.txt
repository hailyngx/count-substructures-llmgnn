Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the labels for each vertex would be:  

| Vertex | Connections | Label |
|--------|-------------|-------|
|   2    |      0      |   0   |
|   1    |      1      |   1   |
|   4    |      1      |   2   |
|   6    |      1      |   3   |
|   0    |      2      |   4   |
|   3    |      2      |   5   |
|   7    |      3      |   6   |
|   9    |      4      |   7   |
|   8    |      5      |   8   |
|   5    |      6      |   9   |

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges based on the labels of the vertices involved, ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
