Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, the sorted list of vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 8, 2, 5, 3, 0, 9, 6, 7, 4, 1

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:
1. Checking the edge (0, 1) - Vertex 0 and Vertex 1 have 2 shared connections: Vertex 9 and Vertex 4
2. Checking the edge (0, 9) - No triangles formed
3. Checking the edge (1, 6) - Vertex 1 and Vertex 6 have 1 shared connection: Vertex 9
4. Checking the edge (2, 7) - No triangles formed
5. Checking the edge (3, 4) - Vertex 3 and Vertex 4 have 1 shared connection: Vertex 9
6. Checking the edge (3, 5) - No triangles formed
7. Checking the edge (4, 7) - Vertex 4 and Vertex 7 have 1 shared connection: Vertex 9
8. Checking the edge (6, 7) - No triangles formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
