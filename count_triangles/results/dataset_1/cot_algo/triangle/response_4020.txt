Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given graph for counting triangles:

0---1---2---7---4
 \ / \ / \ / \ /
  3   8   9   6
   \ / \ / \ /
    5---7---4

After sorting vertices by their degree:
Node 6 (degree 3)
Node 0 (degree 4)
Node 8 (degree 4)
Node 9 (degree 4)
Node 1 (degree 5)
Node 4 (degree 5)
Node 5 (degree 5)
Node 2 (degree 6)
Node 7 (degree 6)
Node 3 (degree 6)

Triangles counted: 
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [10]
