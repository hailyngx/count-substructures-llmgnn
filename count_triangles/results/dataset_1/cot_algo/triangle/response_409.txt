Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels are as follows:
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 1

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we have the following:
- Edge (1, 3): Forms triangles with node 7. Triangle <1, 3, 7>.
- Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 3): Forms triangles with nodes 1 and 7. Triangles <1, 2, 3> and <2, 3, 7>.
- Edge (2, 7): Forms triangles with nodes 1 and 3. Triangle <1, 2, 7>.
- Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 1): Forms a triangle with node 7. Triangle <1, 3, 7>.
- Edge (3, 2): Forms triangles with nodes 1 and 7. Triangles <1, 2, 3> and <2, 3, 7>.
- Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 7): Forms triangles with nodes 1 and 2. Triangles <1, 3, 7> and <2, 3, 7>.
- Edge (4, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 1): Forms a triangle with node 3. Triangle <1, 3, 7>.
- Edge (7, 2): Forms triangles with nodes 1 and 3. Triangles <1, 2, 3> and <2, 3, 7>.
- Edge (7, 3): Forms triangles with nodes 1 and 2. Triangles <1, 3, 7> and <2, 3, 7>.
- Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6], and the unique triangles are <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 7>.
