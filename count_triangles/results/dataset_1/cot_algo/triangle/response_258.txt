Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 3, 5, 9 have 0 degree.
Vertices: 8, 5, 6, 9 have 1 degree.
Vertices: 1, 2 have 2 degree.
Vertices: 0, 4, 7 have 5 degree.

Now, let's relabel the vertices as follows:
Node 0 (degree 5) is relabeled as A.
Node 4 (degree 5) is relabeled as B.
Node 7 (degree 5) is relabeled as C.
Node 1 (degree 2) is relabeled as D.
Node 2 (degree 2) is relabeled as E.
Node 8 (degree 1) is relabeled as F.
Node 6 (degree 1) is relabeled as G.
Node 3 (degree 0) is relabeled as H.
Node 5 (degree 0) is relabeled as I.
Node 9 (degree 0) is relabeled as J.

The edges in the new order are:
(A, B) (A, E) (A, D) (A, C) (A, F) (B, A) (B, E) (B, D) (E, A) (E, B) (H, D) (D, A) (D, B) (D, H) (D, G) (D, C) (G, D) (G, C) (C, A) (C, B) (C, G) (F, A)

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <A, B, E>
- Triangle <A, B, D>
- Triangle <A, B, C>
- Triangle <A, D, H>
- Triangle <A, D, G>
- Triangle <A, D, C>
- Total number of triangles: [6]
