Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 3: 0 connections  
Node 5: 0 connections  
Node 7: 1 connection  
Node 9: 1 connection  
Node 4: 2 connections  
Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 6: 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can determine the number of triangles in the graph.  
There are [9] triangles in total.  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 2>  
<1, 2, 6>  
<1, 4, 8>  
<1, 6, 7>  
<1, 6, 9>  
<2, 6, 7>  
<4, 6, 8>  
<6, 7, 9>  
<6, 8, 9>
