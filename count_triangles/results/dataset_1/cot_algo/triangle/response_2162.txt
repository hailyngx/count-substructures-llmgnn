Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0: Degree 2
- Vertex 4: Degree 2
- Vertex 3: Degree 3
- Vertex 5: Degree 3
- Vertex 7: Degree 0
- Vertex 1: Degree 4
- Vertex 2: Degree 4
- Vertex 6: Degree 5
- Vertex 8: Degree 4
- Vertex 9: Degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and analyzing the given edges, we can find the triangles and count them:

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
