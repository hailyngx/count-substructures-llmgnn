Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 3, 2, 9, 8, 4, 5, 7, 6, 1, 0.

After relabeling the vertices accordingly, we can list the edges that meet the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections":
(2, 0) (3, 1) (5, 1) (9, 1) (4, 5) (6, 4) (8, 6) (9, 8) (5, 4) (7, 5) (6, 5) (9, 7) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 6).

Now, we can determine the triangles formed by the shared connections:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle 2: <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle 3: <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle 4: <1, 4, 5>
- Triangle 5: <4, 5, 6>
- Triangle 6: <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle 7: <4, 8, 9>
- Triangle 8: <5, 6, 7>
- Triangle 9: <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle 10: <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
