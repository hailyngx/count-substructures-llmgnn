Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will now count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The degrees of the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 3

Based on the above degrees, we can relabel the nodes as follows:
- Node 0 -> Node 3
- Node 1 -> Node 7
- Node 2 -> Node 8
- Node 3 -> Node 1
- Node 4 -> Node 0
- Node 5 -> Node 6
- Node 6 -> Node 5
- Node 7 -> Node 4
- Node 8 -> Node 2

Now, we will go through the edges in the order specified, only proceeding when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 4, 2>
4. <4, 5, 2>
5. <4, 5, 6>
6. <1, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
