Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first label the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:

Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 3
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 5: Degree 2
Vertex 6: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 9: Degree 3
Vertex 4: Degree 2

Next, we will list the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Edges:
(5, 0) -> Forms a triangle with: 2, 6
(6, 0) -> No new triangles
(7, 0) -> No new triangles
(8, 0) -> Forms a triangle with: 2, 5
(2, 5) -> No new triangles
(2, 6) -> No new triangles
(2, 8) -> No new triangles
(4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with: 7, 8
(7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with: 0, 5
(7, 9) -> No new triangles
(8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with: 0, 5

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6], and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 6>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
