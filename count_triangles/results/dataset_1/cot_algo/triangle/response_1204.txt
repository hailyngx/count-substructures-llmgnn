Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. 

The degrees of the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0: 1
Vertex 1: 2
Vertex 2: 4
Vertex 3: 5
Vertex 4: 5
Vertex 5: 2
Vertex 6: 4
Vertex 7: 4
Vertex 8: 2
Vertex 9: 2

Sorting these vertices in ascending order of degrees, we get:
0, 1, 5, 8, 9, 6, 7, 2, 4, 3

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph:
1. For edge (0, 2): No triangles are formed.
2. For edge (1, 7): No triangles are formed.
3. For edge (5, 4): No triangles are formed.
4. For edge (8, 6): No triangles are formed.
5. For edge (9, 8): No triangles are formed.
6. For edge (6, 7): No triangles are formed.
7. For edge (7, 2): Triangle <1, 7, 2> is formed.
8. For edge (7, 3): No triangles are formed.
9. For edge (5, 3): No triangles are formed.
10. For edge (8, 9): No triangles are formed.
11. For edge (6, 4): Triangle <6, 4, 3> is formed.
12. For edge (4, 2): Triangle <5, 4, 2> is formed.
13. For edge (3, 6): No triangles are formed.
14. For edge (2, 3): No triangles are formed.
15. For edge (3, 7): No triangles are formed.
16. For edge (4, 6): Triangle <6, 4, 2> is formed.
17. For edge (4, 7): No triangles are formed.
18. For edge (7, 1): No triangles are formed.
19. For edge (7, 4): Triangle <6, 4, 7> is formed.
20. For edge (4, 5): Triangle <5, 4, 2> is formed.
21. For edge (6, 8): No triangles are formed.
22. For edge (9, 1): No triangles are formed.
23. For edge (1, 9): No triangles are formed.
24. For edge (1, 2): No triangles are formed.
25. For edge (3, 5): Triangle <3, 5, 4> is formed.

Total number of triangles found: [4]
Unique triangles found: <1, 7, 2>, <6, 4, 3>, <5, 4, 2>, <6, 4, 7>
