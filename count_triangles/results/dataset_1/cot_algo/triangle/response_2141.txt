Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The current degrees of the vertices in this graph are:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 5 connections
- Vertex 2: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 5 connections

Let's relabel the vertices based on increasing degrees and go through each edge to count the triangles.

The newly labeled graph:
- Vertex 0 -> 0 (2 connections)
- Vertex 4 -> 1 (2 connections)
- Vertex 6 -> 2 (2 connections)
- Vertex 2 -> 3 (3 connections)
- Vertex 3 -> 4 (3 connections)
- Vertex 5 -> 5 (3 connections)
- Vertex 8 -> 6 (3 connections)
- Vertex 7 -> 7 (4 connections)
- Vertex 1 -> 8 (5 connections)
- Vertex 9 -> 9 (5 connections)

Counting the triangles:
- Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle <1, 5, 9>
- Triangle <1, 6, 7>
- Triangle <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
