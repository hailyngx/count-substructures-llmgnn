Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled based on their number of connections in ascending order:
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4

Sorting the edges based on the node with the lower label having fewer connections, we have:
(3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 9), (1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 2), (2, 8), (7, 5), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2)

Counting the triangles formed by shared connections between the vertices:
Total number of triangles: 4
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
