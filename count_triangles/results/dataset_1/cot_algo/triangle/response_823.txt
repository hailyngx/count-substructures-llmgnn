Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Nodes sorted by number of connections:
Node 4: 0 connections
Nodes 8, 0, 1, 3, 4: 1 connection
Nodes 6, 9, 2: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections

Calculating triangles:
- Edge (0, 2) is skipped since Node 0 has more connections than Node 2.
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with Node 2: <0, 2, 7>.
- Edge (1, 5) is skipped since Node 1 has more connections than Node 5.
- Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with Node 5: <1, 5, 9>.
- Edge (2, 0) is skipped since Node 2 has more connections than Node 0.
- Edge (2, 3) is skipped since Node 3 has more connections than Node 2.
- Edge (3, 2) forms a triangle with Node 8: <2, 3, 8>.
- Edge (3, 8) is skipped since Node 3 has more connections than Node 8.
- Edge (5, 1) is skipped since Node 5 has more connections than Node 1.
- Edge (5, 6) forms a triangle with Node 9: <5, 6, 9>.
- Edge (5, 9) is skipped since Node 9 has more connections than Node 5.
- Edge (6, 5) forms a triangle with Node 9: <5, 6, 9>.
- Edge (6, 7) is skipped since Node 7 has more connections than Node 6.
- Edge (6, 9) forms a triangle with Nodes 5 and 6: <5, 6, 9>.
- Edge (7, 0) forms a triangle with Node 2: <0, 2, 7>.
- Edge (7, 6) forms a triangle with Node 9: <6, 7, 9>.
- Edge (8, 3) is skipped since Node 8 has more connections than Node 3.
- Edge (9, 1) forms a triangle with Node 5: <1, 5, 9>.
- Edge (9, 5) is skipped since Node 9 has more connections than Node 5.
- Edge (9, 6) forms a triangle with Nodes 5 and 6: <5, 6, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [5]
