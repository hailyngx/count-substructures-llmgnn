Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 1)
2 (degree 1)
3 (degree 3)
4 (degree 0)
5 (degree 5)
6 (degree 3)
7 (degree 4)
8 (degree 1)
9 (degree 4)

Relabeling the vertices:
0 (degree 1)
1 (degree 0)
2 (degree 0)
3 (degree 2)
4 (degree 3)
5 (degree 7)
6 (degree 4)
7 (degree 5)
8 (degree 0)
9 (degree 5)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the connections of each edge:

- Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 3, 5>
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with vertices 2 and 6: <0, 5, 2> and <0, 5, 6>
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 0) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <3, 0, 5>
- Edge (3, 7) forms a triangle with vertices 5 and 6: <3, 7, 5> and <3, 7, 6>
- Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 7: <3, 9, 7>
- Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 7: <5, 6, 7>
- Edge (5, 7) forms a triangle with vertices 3 and 6: <5, 7, 3> and <5, 7, 6>
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 7: <6, 5, 7>
- Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <7, 3, 5>
- Edge (7, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 6: <7, 5, 6>
- Edge (7, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 3: <7, 9, 3>
- Edge (8, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 7: <9, 3, 7>
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
