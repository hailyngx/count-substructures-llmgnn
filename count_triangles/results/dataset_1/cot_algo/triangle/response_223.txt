Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are as follows: 

Node 3 has 1 connection.
Node 6 has 2 connections.
Nodes 2, 7, and 0 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 1 and 4 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 5 and 9 have 5 connections each.
Node 8 has 6 connections.

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [11]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 6>
