Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's count the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3

Now, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0 (degree 3) becomes Node A
- Node 6 (degree 3) becomes Node B
- Node 7 (degree 3) becomes Node C
- Node 9 (degree 3) becomes Node D
- Node 3 (degree 4) becomes Node E
- Node 4 (degree 4) becomes Node F
- Node 8 (degree 4) becomes Node G
- Node 2 (degree 5) becomes Node H
- Node 1 (degree 5) becomes Node I
- Node 5 (degree 6) becomes Node J

Now, we will list the edges in the new labeling system:
- (A, H) (A, J) (A, C) 
- (B, H) (B, J) (B, G)
- (C, I) (C, G) (C, H)
- (D, I) (D, H) (D, J)
- (E, I) (E, F)
- (F, H) (F, G)
- (G, E) (G, F) (G, B)
- (H, G) (H, F) (H, D) (H, A)
- (I, C) (I, D) (I, E) (I, J)
- (J, A) (J, D) (J, B) (J, I)

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Total number of triangles: [6]
- Unique triangles: <A, H, J>, <A, C, H>, <A, C, I>, <D, I, J>, <E, F, G>, <G, H, I>
