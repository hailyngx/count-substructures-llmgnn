Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 1 (degree 1)
Node 7 (degree 1)
Node 9 (degree 1)
Node 3 (degree 2)
Node 4 (degree 2)
Node 5 (degree 3)
Node 6 (degree 3)
Node 0 (degree 4)
Node 8 (degree 4)
Node 2 (degree 4)

Using the degree-based ordering, we will now count the triangles:

1. For edge (0, 1):
   Node 1 has degree 1, which is less than Node 0's degree.
   Node 1 has a shared connection with Node 0.
   Triangle formed: <0, 1, 6>

2. For edge (0, 3):
   Node 3 has degree 2, which is less than Node 0's degree.
   Node 3 has a shared connection with Node 0.
   Triangle formed: <0, 3, 2>

3. For edge (0, 8):
   Node 8 has degree 4, which is more than Node 0's degree. Not considered.

4. For edge (1, 6):
   Node 6 has degree 3, which is less than Node 1's degree.
   Node 6 has a shared connection with Node 1.
   Triangle formed: <1, 6, 8>

No more edges can be processed. Counting the total number of triangles, we get:
[2]
