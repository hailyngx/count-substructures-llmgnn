Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 7
Node 6: Degree 7
Node 7: Degree 8

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
