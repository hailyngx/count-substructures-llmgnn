Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices after relabeling:
0: 0
1: 2
2: 1
3: 3
4: 4
5: 7
6: 5
7: 8
