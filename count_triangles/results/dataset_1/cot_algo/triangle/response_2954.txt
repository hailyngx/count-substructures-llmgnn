Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by the number of connections are: 

Vertex 4 (degree 1)  
Vertex 3 (degree 2)  
Vertex 9 (degree 2)  
Vertex 5 (degree 3)  
Vertex 2 (degree 4)  
Vertex 7 (degree 4)  
Vertex 1 (degree 5)  
Vertex 6 (degree 5)  
Vertex 0 (degree 6)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(4, 7)  
(3, 7)  
(9, 0)  
(9, 1)  

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.  
The unique triangles found are:  
<2, 7, 4>  
<1, 9, 0>  
<1, 9, 6>
