Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles based on the edges provided.

Triangles:
