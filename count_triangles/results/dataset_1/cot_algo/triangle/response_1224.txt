Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices by degree:
0: 2
1: 2
2: 1
3: 4
4: 2
5: 2
6: 1
7: 4
8: 2
9: 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
Vertices by degree after relabeling:
0: 0
1: 2
2: 4
3: 1
4: 3
5: 5
6: 6
7: 7
8: 8
9: 9

Now, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>
<3, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
