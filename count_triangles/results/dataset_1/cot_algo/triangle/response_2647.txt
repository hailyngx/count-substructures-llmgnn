Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following relabeling:  
Node 4: Degree 1  
Node 6: Degree 1  
Node 7: Degree 2  
Node 1: Degree 2  
Node 3: Degree 2  
Node 5: Degree 3  
Node 0: Degree 3  
Node 9: Degree 4  
Node 8: Degree 5  
Node 2: Degree 5  

Now, let's calculate the triangles:  
For edge (0, 5):  
Both 0 and 5 are connected to 8, forming a triangle <0, 5, 8>.

For edge (0, 8):  
Both 0 and 8 are connected to 5, forming a triangle <0, 8, 5>.  

For edge (0, 9):  
Both 0 and 9 are connected to 8, forming a triangle <0, 9, 8>.  

For edge (1, 5):  
Both 1 and 5 are connected to 8, forming a triangle <1, 5, 8>.

For edge (1, 8):  
Both 1 and 8 are connected to 5, forming a triangle <1, 8, 5>.  

No triangles are formed by edges with nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7 based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

For edge (8, 7):  
Both 7 and 8 are connected to 2, forming a triangle <7, 8, 2>.  

For edge (8, 9):  
Both 8 and 9 are connected to 0, forming a triangle <8, 9, 0>.  

For edge (9, 4):  
Both 4 and 9 are connected to 0, forming a triangle <4, 9, 0>.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
