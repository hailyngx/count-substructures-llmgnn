Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 1 (degree 0): 7
Vertex 2 (degree 2): 0, 1
Vertex 3 (degree 3): 3, 5, 8
Vertex 4 (degree 4): 2
Vertex 5 (degree 4): 6, 9

Now, we will enumerate the vertices accordingly:
0 -> 1
1 -> 2
3 -> 3
5 -> 4
6 -> 5
2 -> 6
8 -> 7
4 -> 8
9 -> 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: <1, 3, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 8>
