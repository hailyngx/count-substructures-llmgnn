Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree, then relabeling them accordingly. Here is the sorted list of nodes with their respective degrees:

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 3 connections

Following the method, we start examining edges starting from nodes with the lowest degrees. We proceed with the process of counting the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 8, 7>
<4, 5, 2>
<6, 9, 7>
<6, 1, 0>
<7, 8, 0>
<7, 9, 3>
<8, 0, 1>
<8, 3, 4>
<8, 7, 9>
<9, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
