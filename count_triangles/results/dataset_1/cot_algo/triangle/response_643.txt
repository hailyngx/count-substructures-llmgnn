Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 2 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 1 connection.
Nodes 8 and 6 have 2 connections.
Nodes 3 and 7 have 3 connections.
Nodes 0 and 8 have 4 connections.
Nodes 9 and 2 have 5 connections.

Relabeling the nodes:
0 → 0
2 → 1
7 → 2
8 → 3
6 → 4
3 → 5
4 → 6
1 → 7
9 → 8
5 → 9

Now, based on the relabeled nodes, the edges are:
(0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 6) (3, 7) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9)

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. <0, 7, 6>
2. <0, 7, 9>
3. <7, 6, 5>
4. <7, 6, 8>
5. <7, 0, 9>
6. <9, 0, 4>
7. <9, 7, 4>
8. <4, 7, 6>
9. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is: [9]
