Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:
- Node 7 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 7 have 1 connection.
- Nodes 6, 8 have 2 connections.
- Nodes 2, 3, 9 have 4 connections.

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degree:
- Node 7 is relabeled as 0.
- Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 7 are relabeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Nodes 6, 8 are relabeled as 6, 7.
- Nodes 2, 3, 9 are relabeled as 8, 9, 10.

Next, we will count the triangles by iterating through the edges. Since all the vertices are now appropriately labeled, we start counting the triangles:
- For edge (0, 9): No triangle formed.
- For edge (1, 3): Triangle formed with node 2. Triangle: <1, 2, 3>.
- For edge (1, 9): No triangle formed.
- For edge (2, 3): Triangle formed with node 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 3>.
- For edge (2, 6): No triangle formed.
- For edge (2, 8): No triangle formed.
- For edge (2, 9): No triangle formed.
- For edge (3, 1): No triangle formed.
- For edge (3, 2): Triangle formed with node 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 3>.
- For edge (3, 5): No triangle formed.
- For edge (4, 9): No triangle formed.
- For edge (5, 3): No triangle formed.
- For edge (5, 9): No triangle formed.
- For edge (6, 2): No triangle formed.
- For edge (6, 8): No triangle formed.
- For edge (8, 2): No triangle formed.
- For edge (8, 6): No triangle formed.
- For edge (9, 0): No triangle formed.
- For edge (9, 1): No triangle formed.
- For edge (9, 2): No triangle formed.
- For edge (9, 4): No triangle formed.
- For edge (9, 5): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 3 inside brackets [] and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 3>.
