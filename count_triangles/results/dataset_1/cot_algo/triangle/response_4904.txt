Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes sorted by their number of connections:
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Now we will iterate through each edge, ensuring the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Checking edge (0, 3): Node 0 has 3 connections, Node 3 has 6 connections. No triangle formed.
Checking edge (0, 4): Node 0 has 3 connections, Node 4 has 5 connections. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 3>.
Checking edge (0, 8): Node 0 has 3 connections, Node 8 has 4 connections. No triangle formed.
Checking edge (1, 8): Node 1 has 0 connections, Node 8 has 4 connections. No triangle formed.
