Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their degree, which is the number of connections each vertex has. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their corresponding degrees:
0: 2
1: 3
5: 2
4: 2
6: 1
9: 1
3: 3
7: 4
8: 4
2: 4

Next, we will check each edge based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections. 

Checking the edges:
(0, 1) - Both vertices have degree 2, so we proceed: Shares connection with 5 forming a triangle. Triangle <0, 1, 5>.
(0, 5) - Vertex 0 has degree 2, Vertex 5 has degree 2: Shares connection with 1 forming a triangle. Triangle <0, 1, 5>.
(1, 0) - Already counted above.
(1, 2) - Both vertices have degree 3, so we proceed: Shares connection with 5 forming a triangle. Triangle <1, 2, 5>.
(1, 5) - Already counted above.
(2, 1) - Already counted above.
(2, 3) - Vertex 2 has degree 4, Vertex 3 has degree 3: Shares connection with 1 forming a triangle. Triangle <2, 3, 1>.
(2, 4) - Vertex 2 has degree 4, Vertex 4 has degree 2: Shares connection with 7 forming a triangle. Triangle <2, 4, 7>.
(2, 8) - Vertex 2 has degree 4, Vertex 8 has degree 4: Shares connection with 7 forming a triangle. Triangle <2, 8, 7>.
(3, 2) - Already counted above.
(3, 7) - Shares connection with 9 forming a triangle. Triangle <3, 7, 9>.
(3, 9) - Shares connection with 7 forming a triangle. Triangle <3, 7, 9>.
(4, 2) - Already counted above.
(4, 7) - Shares connection with 8 forming a triangle. Triangle <4, 7, 8>.
(5, 0) - Already counted above.
(5, 1) - Already counted above.
(6, 8) - Vertex 6 has degree 1, Vertex 8 has degree 4: No triangle.
(7, 3) - Already counted above.
(7, 4) - Already counted above.
(7, 8) - Already counted above.
(8, 2) - Already counted above.
(8, 6) - Shares connection with 7 forming a triangle. Triangle <8, 6, 7>.
(8, 7) - Already counted above.
(9, 3) - Already counted above.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
