Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 6 is adjacent to 0 nodes
Node 2 is adjacent to 1 nodes
Node 9 is adjacent to 1 nodes
Node 3 is adjacent to 1 nodes
Node 1 is adjacent to 2 nodes
Node 4 is adjacent to 2 nodes
Node 7 is adjacent to 4 nodes
Node 5 is adjacent to 4 nodes
Node 8 is adjacent to 4 nodes
Node 0 is adjacent to 5 nodes

After relabeling the nodes:

Node 6 (degree 0)
Node 2 (degree 1)
Node 9 (degree 1)
Node 3 (degree 1)
Node 1 (degree 2)
Node 4 (degree 2)
Node 7 (degree 4)
Node 5 (degree 4)
Node 8 (degree 4)
Node 0 (degree 5)

Now, we check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Checking edge (0, 7): Nodes 0 and 7 share connections with nodes 4 and 5, forming a triangle <0, 4, 5>.
Checking edge (0, 8): Nodes 0 and 8 share connections with nodes 1 and 5, forming a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
Checking edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
Checking edge (1, 8): Nodes 1 and 8 share connections with node 0, forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.
Checking edge (2, 1): No triangle formed.
Checking edge (3, 5): No triangle formed.
Checking edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.
Checking edge (4, 9): No triangle formed.
Checking edge (5, 3): No triangle formed.
Checking edge (5, 7): No triangle formed.
Checking edge (5, 8): Nodes 5 and 8 share connections with nodes 0 and 1, forming a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
Checking edge (7, 0): No triangle formed.
Checking edge (7, 4): Nodes 7 and 4 share connections with node 5, forming a triangle <4, 5, 7>.
Checking edge (7, 5): No triangle formed.
Checking edge (8, 0): No triangle formed.
Checking edge (8, 1): Nodes 8 and 1 share connections with node 0, forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.
Checking edge (8, 5): Nodes 8 and 5 share connections with node 0, forming a triangle <0, 5, 8>.
Checking edge (9, 4): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, and <0, 1, 8>.
