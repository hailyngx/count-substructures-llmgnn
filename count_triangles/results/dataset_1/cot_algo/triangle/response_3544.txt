Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5, 6, 3

Now, we will check the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 1) - Shared connections: 3, 9
2. Edge (0, 3) - Shared connections: 1
3. Edge (0, 9) - Shared connections: 1
4. Edge (1, 2) - Shared connections: 3
5. Edge (1, 8) - No triangles formed
6. Edge (1, 9) - Shared connections: 0
7. Edge (2, 3) - No triangles formed
8. Edge (3, 5) - Shared connections: 2
9. Edge (3, 6) - Shared connections: 5
10. Edge (3, 7) - No triangles formed
11. Edge (5, 6) - Shared connections: 3
12. Edge (5, 8) - No triangles formed
13. Edge (6, 9) - Shared connections: 3

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
