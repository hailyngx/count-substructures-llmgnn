Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following list:
Vertices: [1, 0, 8, 7, 5, 2, 3, 6, 9, 4]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
