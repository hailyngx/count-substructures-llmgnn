Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are: 

0 (degree 2), 2 (degree 2), 6 (degree 2), 8 (degree 2), 

7 (degree 4), 

1 (degree 5), 

5 (degree 5), 

3 (degree 6), 

9 (degree 6), 

4 (degree 7). 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:

(0, 1): forms 1 triangle <0, 1, 5>
(1, 7): forms 1 triangle <1, 7, 4>
(1, 9): forms 1 triangle <1, 9, 4>
(2, 5): no triangles
(3, 5): forms 1 triangle <3, 5, 9>
(3, 6): no triangles
(3, 9): forms 1 triangle <3, 9, 5>
(4, 5): forms 1 triangle <4, 5, 9>
(4, 7): forms 1 triangle <4, 7, 1>
(4, 8): no triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
