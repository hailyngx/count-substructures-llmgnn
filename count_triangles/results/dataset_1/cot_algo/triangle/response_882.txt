Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree from least to most connections, the new labeling is as follows:
- Vertex 1 has 4 connections.
- Vertex 4 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 3 has 3 connections.
- Vertex 7 has 3 connections.
- Vertex 8 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 9 has 3 connections.
- Vertex 5 has 5 connections.
- Vertex 6 has 4 connections.
- Vertex 2 has 6 connections.

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles.

The triangles in the graph are: 
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <2, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
