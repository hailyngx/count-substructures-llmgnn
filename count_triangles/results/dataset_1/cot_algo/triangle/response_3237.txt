Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
0 -> 1 connection
3 -> 1 connection
5 -> 1 connection
7 -> 1 connection
6 -> 2 connections
8 -> 2 connections
9 -> 2 connections
1 -> 5 connections
2 -> 4 connections
4 -> 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we can identify the following triangles:
<1, 3, 0>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 8, 2>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
