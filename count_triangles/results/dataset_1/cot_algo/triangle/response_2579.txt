Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 3 -> 0 connections
Node 4 -> 1 connection
Node 5 -> 2 connections
Node 7 -> 2 connections
Node 0 -> 4 connections
Node 1 -> 5 connections
Node 8 -> 5 connections
Node 2 -> 6 connections
Node 6 -> 6 connections
Node 9 -> 6 connections

Now, following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we find the triangles formed by shared connections:

1. <1, 4, 5>
2. <1, 5, 8>
3. <1, 5, 2>
4. <1, 5, 0>
5. <1, 5, 6>
6. <1, 5, 9>
7. <4, 3, 6>
8. <5, 2, 0>
9. <5, 2, 6>
10. <5, 2, 9>
11. <2, 6, 0>
12. <2, 6, 9>
13. <6, 0, 9>

There are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
