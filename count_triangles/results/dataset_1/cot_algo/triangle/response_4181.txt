Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 4 has 0 connection(s).
- Node 0 has 2 connection(s).
- Node 2 has 2 connection(s).
- Node 9 has 1 connection(s).
- Node 1 has 4 connection(s).
- Node 6 has 2 connection(s).
- Node 8 has 2 connection(s).
- Node 3 has 3 connection(s).
- Node 5 has 4 connection(s).
- Node 7 has 4 connection(s).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
6. Triangle <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
