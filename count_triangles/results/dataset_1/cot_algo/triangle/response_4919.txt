Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the connections for each node:
Node 0: 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 1: 2, 9
Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 4, 9
Node 4: 2, 3, 8
Node 5: 6, 9
Node 6: 5, 8
Node 7: 0, 2
Node 8: 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

Based on the degree-based ordering, we can relabel the nodes as follows:
Node 0 (degree 4) -> Node 0
Node 1 (degree 2) -> Node 1
Node 4 (degree 3) -> Node 2
Node 6 (degree 2) -> Node 3
Node 7 (degree 2) -> Node 4
Node 3 (degree 3) -> Node 5
Node 5 (degree 2) -> Node 6
Node 8 (degree 3) -> Node 7
Node 2 (degree 5) -> Node 8
Node 9 (degree 6) -> Node 9

Now, we will count the triangles by checking the shared connections between nodes for each edge:
(0, 2) shares connections with 3 and 7, forming triangle <0, 2, 7>.
(0, 3) shares connections with 2 and 9, forming triangle <0, 3, 9>.
(0, 7) and (0, 9) do not form triangles as Node 0 has higher degree than both.
(1, 2) shares connection with 9, forming triangle <1, 2, 9>.
(1, 9) does not form a triangle as Node 1 has higher degree than Node 9.
(2, 4) does not form a triangle as Node 2 has higher degree than Node 4.
(2, 7) does not form a triangle as Node 2 has higher degree than Node 7.
(2, 1) shares connection with 9, forming triangle <1, 2, 9>.
(2, 9) does not form a triangle as Node 2 has higher degree than Node 9.
(3, 4) does not form a triangle as Node 3 has higher degree than Node 4.
(3, 9) does not form a triangle as Node 3 has higher degree than Node 9.
(4, 8) does not form a triangle as Node 4 has higher degree than Node 8.
(5, 6) does not form a triangle as Node 5 has higher degree than Node 6.
(5, 9) does not form a triangle as Node 5 has higher degree than Node 9.
(6, 8) does not form a triangle as Node 6 has higher degree than Node 8.
(7, 9) does not form a triangle as Node 7 has higher degree than Node 9.
(8, 9) does not form a triangle as Node 8 has higher degree than Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 9>.
