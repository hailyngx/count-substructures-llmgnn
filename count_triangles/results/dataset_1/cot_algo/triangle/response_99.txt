Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections.

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections), the new label for each vertex is as follows:
Node 1 (degree 3) -> 0
Node 7 (degree 3) -> 1
Node 4 (degree 1) -> 2
Node 5 (degree 2) -> 3
Node 8 (degree 1) -> 4
Node 0 (degree 4) -> 5
Node 9 (degree 4) -> 6
Node 6 (degree 3) -> 7
Node 2 (degree 3) -> 8
Node 3 (degree 5) -> 9

Now, we check each edge to count the triangles:

For edge (0, 1):
- Node 0 (5) and Node 1 (0) share a connection with Node 3 (9) forming a triangle: <0, 1, 3>

For edge (0, 2):
- Node 0 (5) and Node 2 (8) share a connection with Node 6 (7) forming a triangle: <0, 2, 6>

For edge (0, 3):
- Node 0 (5) and Node 3 (9) share connections with Node 5 (3) and Node 6 (7) forming two triangles: <0, 3, 5> and <0, 3, 6>

For edge (0, 4):
- No triangles are formed since Node 0 (5) has a higher degree than Node 4 (2).

For the remaining edges, no triangles are formed due to higher degree vertices having the lower labels. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 5>, and <0, 3, 6>.
