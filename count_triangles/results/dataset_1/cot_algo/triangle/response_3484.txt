Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the nodes are: 

Node 8 (0 connections)  
Node 2 (1 connection)  
Node 4 (2 connections)  
Node 5 (2 connections)  
Node 0 (3 connections)  
Node 1 (4 connections)  
Node 6 (4 connections)  
Node 9 (4 connections)  
Node 3 (5 connections)  
Node 7 (5 connections)  

Now, processing the edges:

Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: Triangle <0, 3, 6>  
Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: Triangle <0, 6, 5>  
Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: Triangle <1, 3, 2>  
Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle (nodes are already taken)  
Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle (nodes are already taken)  
Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: Triangle <1, 9, 5>  
Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle (nodes are already taken)  
Edge (3, 0) and (3, 1) do not form triangles (nodes have fewer connections)  
Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle (one node has fewer connections)  
Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: Triangle <3, 9, 5>  
Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle (nodes are already taken)  
Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle (nodes are already taken)  
Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle (nodes are already taken)  
Edge (5, 4), (5, 6), and (5, 7) do not form triangles (nodes have fewer connections)  
Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle (nodes are already taken)  
Edge (6, 0) and (6, 7) do not form triangles (nodes have fewer connections)  
Edge (9, 1) and (9, 3) do not form triangles (nodes have fewer connections)  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
