Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the vertices, the sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows:
\[ 1 < 0, 5 < 3, 6 < 4, 7 < 9, 2, 8 \]

Following the method, we will count the triangles formed by the edges in the graph:

1. For edge (0, 1):
   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1 and 8.
   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 0 and 6.
   - The shared connection is vertex 1.
   - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 6>

2. For edge (0, 8): No triangles are formed.

3. For edge (1, 6): No triangles are formed.

4. For edge (2, 3): No triangles are formed.

5. For edge (2, 4):
   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 3, 4, 5, and 9.
   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 2, 3, 5, and 8.
   - The shared connections are vertices 2 and 4.
   - Triangles formed: <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 5>

6. For edge (2, 5): No triangles are formed.

7. For edge (2, 9): No triangles are formed.

8. For edge (3, 4): No triangles are formed.

9. For edge (4, 3): No triangles are formed.

10. For edge (4, 5): No triangles are formed.

11. For edge (4, 8): No triangles are formed.

12. For edge (5, 2): No triangles are formed.

13. For edge (5, 6): No triangles are formed.

14. For edge (5, 7): No triangles are formed.

15. For edge (5, 4): No triangles are formed.

16. For edge (6, 1): No triangles are formed.

17. For edge (6, 5): No triangles are formed.

18. For edge (6, 7): No triangles are formed.

19. For edge (6, 8): No triangles are formed.

20. For edge (7, 5): No triangles are formed.

21. For edge (7, 6): No triangles are formed.

22. For edge (7, 8): No triangles are formed.

23. For edge (7, 9): No triangles are formed.

24. For edge (8, 0): No triangles are formed.

25. For edge (8, 4): No triangles are formed.

26. For edge (8, 6): No triangles are formed.

27. For edge (8, 7): No triangles are formed.

28. For edge (8, 9): No triangles are formed.

29. For edge (9, 2): No triangles are formed.

30. For edge (9, 7): No triangles are formed.

31. For edge (9, 8): No triangles are formed.

In this graph, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6> and <2, 4, 3>.
