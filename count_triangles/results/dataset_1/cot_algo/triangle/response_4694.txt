Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Vertex 5 - 2 connections
Vertex 1 - 2 connections
Vertex 9 - 2 connections
Vertex 3 - 3 connections
Vertex 4 - 3 connections
Vertex 0 - 4 connections
Vertex 6 - 4 connections
Vertex 8 - 4 connections
Vertex 7 - 5 connections
Vertex 2 - 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 0, 7>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 8, 9>
