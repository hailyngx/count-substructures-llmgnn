Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph. 

The vertices sorted by the number of connections are:
Vertex 6 (Degree 1)
Vertex 1 (Degree 2)
Vertex 8 (Degree 2)
Vertex 7 (Degree 2)
Vertex 2 (Degree 3)
Vertex 9 (Degree 4)
Vertex 0 (Degree 6)
Vertex 3 (Degree 6)
Vertex 4 (Degree 6)
Vertex 5 (Degree 6)

Starting with the edge (0, 2) as vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 2:
- Vertex 0 shares connections with vertex 2 and 4, forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.

Moving to the next suitable edge (0, 3):
- Vertex 0 shares connections with vertex 3 and 5, forming a triangle <0, 3, 5>.

Continuing with the next suitable edge (0, 4):
- Vertex 0 shares connections with vertex 2 and 4 (already counted), so no new triangle.

Proceeding to the next suitable edge (0, 5):
- Vertex 0 shares connections with vertex 3 and 5 (already counted), so no new triangle.

Next suitable edge is (0, 8):
- Vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 8, so this edge is skipped.

Moving on to the edge (0, 9):
- Vertex 0 shares connections with vertex 5 and 9, forming a triangle <0, 5, 9>.

Continuing with the edge (1, 4):
- Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 4, but vertex 1 doesn't share a connection with vertex 4, so no new triangle.

The next suitable edge is (1, 5):
- Vertex 1 shares connections with vertex 4 and 5, forming a triangle <1, 4, 5>.

Since all edges have been checked, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
