Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 8: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we start with edges involving nodes with the lowest number of connections:

1. Considering node 1 (1 connection):
    No triangles can be formed.

2. Considering node 5 (1 connection):
    No triangles can be formed.

3. Considering node 6 (1 connection):
    No triangles can be formed.

4. Considering node 9 (2 connections):
    No triangles can be formed.

5. Considering node 7 (4 connections):
    No triangles can be formed.

6. Considering node 2 (4 connections):
    No triangles can be formed.

7. Considering node 3 (4 connections):
    No triangles can be formed.

8. Considering node 0 (4 connections):
    Triangle found: <0, 4, 7>

9. Considering node 4 (5 connections):
    Triangles found: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
