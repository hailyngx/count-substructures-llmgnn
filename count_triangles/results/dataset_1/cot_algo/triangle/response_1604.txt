Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges according to the new labels assigned to the vertices.
