Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps us in counting triangles efficiently. Let's begin by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 0 has 2 connections,
Node 2 has 1 connection,
Node 9 has 2 connections,
Node 3 has 2 connections,
Node 5 has 2 connections,
Node 6 has 3 connections,
Node 4 has 3 connections,
Node 1 has 4 connections,
Node 8 has 5 connections,
Node 7 has 5 connections.

We will relabel the vertices accordingly: 
Node 2 (degree 1) -> A
Node 0, 9, 3, 5 (degree 2) -> B, C, D, E
Node 6, 4 (degree 3) -> F, G
Node 1 (degree 4) -> H
Node 8, 7 (degree 5) -> I, J

Next, we will interpret the edges according to the relabeled vertices. Since we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will consider the following edges for counting triangles:

(B, E) - Forms a triangle with node J.
(D, J) - Forms a triangle with nodes F and G.
(E, J) - Forms a triangle with node G.
(E, F) - Forms a triangle with node J.
(B, C) - Forms a triangle with node D.
(C, D) - Forms a triangle with node J.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <B, E, J>, <D, J, F>, and <C, D, J>.
