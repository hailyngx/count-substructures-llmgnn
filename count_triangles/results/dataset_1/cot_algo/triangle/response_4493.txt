Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices based on the number of edges (connections) each vertex has. Then, the vertices are relabeled accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is as follows:
0: 4 connections
3: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
1: 4 connections
9: 5 connections
4: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles. Starting with the edges involving vertices with lower degree:
- Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 7) forms a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 1) forms a triangle <1, 5, 7>.

Finally, we count the total number of triangles: 
There are [2] triangles found in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 7> and <1, 5, 7>.
