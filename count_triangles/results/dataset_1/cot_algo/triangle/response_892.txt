Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 9 has 1 connection.
Nodes 4, 8 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 3, 5 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 1, 6, 9 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 0, 2 have 4 connections each.
Node 7 has 6 connections.

Sorting the nodes based on the number of connections:
Nodes 6, 9, 4, 8, 3, 5, 1, 2, 0, 7

Checking the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Checking (0, 2), both have 4 connections, so skip.
Checking (0, 4), 4 has 2 connections, so proceed.
4 has connections with 0 and 7 which form a triangle <0, 4, 7>.

Checking (0, 7), 7 has 6 connections, so skip.
Checking (1, 2), both have 4 connections, so skip.
Checking (1, 3), both have 3 connections, so skip.
Checking (1, 7), 1 has 3 connections, so proceed.
1 has connections with 2 and 7 which form a triangle <1, 2, 7>.

Checking (2, 1), this pair has already been counted in the previous step, so skip.
Checking (3, 1), this pair has no triangles as both nodes have the same number of connections, so skip.
Checking (3, 5), both have 3 connections, so skip.
Checking (4, 0), this pair has already been counted in a previous step, so skip.
Checking (5, 3), this pair has no triangles as both nodes have the same number of connections, so skip.
Checking (5, 9), both have 1 connection, so skip.
Checking (6, 7), 6 has 1 connection, so proceed.
6 has a connection with 7, forming a triangle <6, 7, 0>.

Checking (7, 0), this pair has already been counted in a previous step, so skip.
Checking (7, 1), this pair has already been counted in a previous step, so skip.
Checking (7, 6), this pair has already been counted in a previous step, so skip.
Checking (7, 8), 8 has 2 connections, so proceed.
8 has a connection with 7, forming a triangle <7, 8, 4>.

Checking (8, 7), this pair has already been counted in a previous step, so skip.
Checking (9, 5), this pair has no triangles as both nodes have the same number of connections, so skip.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <6, 7, 0>, and <7, 8, 4>.
