Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 9: 7 connections

Next, we will check for triangles starting from the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 4]
