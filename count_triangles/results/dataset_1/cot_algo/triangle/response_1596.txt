Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 5
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 5
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 1

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(2, 4)
(0, 1)
(5, 0)
(4, 5)
(7, 2)
(1, 3)
(2, 7)
(6, 8)
(4, 7)
(3, 9)
(4, 8)
(8, 3)
(3, 8)
(1, 6)
(3, 0)
(6, 0)
(0, 3)
(6, 1)
(6, 2)
(8, 4)
(8, 6)
(3, 1)
(4, 2)
(4, 6)
(5, 4)

After checking for shared connections, the total number of triangles is [9].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 4>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>.
