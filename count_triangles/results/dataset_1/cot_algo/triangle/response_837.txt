Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections from least to most, the new labeling of the vertices is:
Node 7 - 0 connections
Node 1 - 1 connection
Nodes 6, 8 - 2 connections
Nodes 3, 5, 9 - 3 connections
Nodes 0, 2, 4 - 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2): Triangle formed with shared connection with Node 4 <0, 2, 4>
2. Edge (0, 4): No triangle formed
3. Edge (0, 6): No triangle formed
4. Edge (0, 8): No triangle formed
5. Edge (1, 9): No triangle formed
6. Edge (2, 0): No triangle formed
7. Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed
8. Edge (2, 4): No triangle formed
9. Edge (3, 2): No triangle formed
10. Edge (3, 4): No triangle formed
11. Edge (3, 9): No triangle formed
12. Edge (4, 0): Triangle formed with shared connection with Node 8 <0, 4, 8>
13. Edge (4, 2): No triangle formed
14. Edge (4, 3): No triangle formed
15. Edge (5, 7): No triangle formed
16. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed
17. Edge (5, 9): No triangle formed
18. Edge (6, 0): No triangle formed
19. Edge (7, 5): No triangle formed
20. Edge (8, 0): No triangle formed
21. Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed
22. Edge (9, 1): No triangle formed
23. Edge (9, 3): No triangle formed
24. Edge (9, 5): No triangle formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4> and <0, 4, 8>.
