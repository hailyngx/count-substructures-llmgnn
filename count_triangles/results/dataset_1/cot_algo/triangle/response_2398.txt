Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling will be:  

Node 9: 0 connections  
Node 4: 1 connection  
Node 8: 1 connection  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 7: 2 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 0: 4 connections  

Using this ordering, we find the following triangles:

1. <2, 4, 5>
2. <3, 4, 5>
3. <0, 1, 6>
4. <0, 6, 7>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
