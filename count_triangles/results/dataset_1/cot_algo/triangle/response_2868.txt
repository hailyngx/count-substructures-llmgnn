Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method as described in the prompt. 

First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 0: Degree 1
Vertex 1: Not present
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 4: Degree 3
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 1

Since the vertices are sorted by degree, we can now relabel them accordingly:

Vertex 0: Degree 1 -> Label 0
Vertex 1: Not present
Vertex 2: Degree 4 -> Label 1
Vertex 3: Degree 4 -> Label 2
Vertex 4: Degree 3 -> Label 3
Vertex 5: Degree 3 -> Label 4
Vertex 6: Degree 4 -> Label 5
Vertex 7: Degree 4 -> Label 6
Vertex 8: Degree 4 -> Label 7
Vertex 9: Degree 1 -> Label 8

Now, we will check the edges based on the relabeled vertices:

Edges:
(0, 4) -> Proceed
(1, 2) -> Skip
(1, 5) -> Skip
(1, 6) -> Skip
(2, 3) -> Proceed (Forms a triangle <1, 2, 3>)
(2, 6) -> Proceed
(2, 7) -> Proceed
(3, 6) -> Proceed
(3, 7) -> Proceed
(3, 8) -> Proceed
(4, 5) -> Skip
(4, 7) -> Proceed
(5, 6) -> Proceed
(5, 8) -> Proceed
(6, 7) -> Proceed
(6, 8) -> Proceed (Forms a triangle <2, 6, 8>)
(6, 9) -> Proceed
(7, 8) -> Proceed
(8, 9) -> Skip

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 3> and <2, 6, 8>.
