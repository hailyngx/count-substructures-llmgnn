Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's rearrange the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices:
1. 7 (degree: 1)
2. 6 (degree: 2)
3. 9 (degree: 2)
4. 3 (degree: 2)
5. 1 (degree: 2)
6. 2 (degree: 3)
7. 5 (degree: 3)
8. 8 (degree: 4)
9. 4 (degree: 5)
10. 0 (degree: 5)

Next, let's count the triangles:

1. Check the edges starting from the lowest degree node 7: No triangles.
2. Moving on to node 6: No triangles.
3. Next, node 9: No triangles.
4. Moving to node 3: No triangles.
5. Progressing to node 1: No triangles.
6. Examining node 2:
   - Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
7. Moving to node 5:
   - Edge (3, 5) forms a triangle <3, 5, 9>.
8. Proceeding to node 8: No triangles.
9. Now, node 4:
   - Edges (0, 4) and (1, 4) form a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
10. Finally, node 0:
   - Edges (0, 6) and (0, 7) form a triangle <0, 6, 7>.
   - Edge (0, 2) was already counted from node 2.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <3, 5, 9>, and <0, 1, 4>.
