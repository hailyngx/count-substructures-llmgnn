Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 5 -> 0 connections
Nodes 0, 1, 9 -> 1 connection
Nodes 7, 5  -> 2 connections
Nodes 6, 4 -> 3 connections
Nodes 3, 8 -> 4 connections
Node 2 -> 5 connections

Now, we will check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 2): Node 0 (1 connection), Node 2 (5 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 4
- Edge (1, 3): Node 1 (1 connection), Node 3 (4 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 9
- Edge (1, 9): Node 1 (1 connection), Node 9 (1 connection) -> No triangle
- Edge (2, 0): Node 0 (1 connection), Node 2 (5 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 4
- Edge (2, 4): Node 2 (5 connections), Node 4 (3 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 6
- Edge (2, 7): Node 2 (5 connections), Node 7 (2 connections) -> No triangle
- Edge (2, 8): Node 2 (5 connections), Node 8 (4 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 6
- Edge (3, 1): Node 1 (1 connection), Node 3 (4 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 9
- Edge (3, 4): Node 3 (4 connections), Node 4 (3 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 6
- Edge (3, 6): Node 3 (4 connections), Node 6 (3 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 4
- Edge (3, 7): Node 3 (4 connections), Node 7 (2 connections) -> No triangle
- Edge (4, 2): Node 2 (5 connections), Node 4 (3 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 6
- Edge (4, 3): Node 3 (4 connections), Node 4 (3 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 6
- Edge (4, 6): Node 4 (3 connections), Node 6 (3 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 3
- Edge (5, 8): Node 5 (0 connections), Node 8 (4 connections) -> No triangle
- Edge (6, 3): Node 3 (4 connections), Node 6 (3 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 4
- Edge (6, 4): Node 4 (3 connections), Node 6 (3 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 3
- Edge (6, 8): Node 6 (3 connections), Node 8 (4 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 5
- Edge (7, 2): Node 2 (5 connections), Node 7 (2 connections) -> No triangle
- Edge (7, 3): Node 3 (4 connections), Node 7 (2 connections) -> No triangle
- Edge (8, 2): Node 2 (5 connections), Node 8 (4 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 6
- Edge (8, 5): Node 5 (0 connections), Node 8 (4 connections) -> No triangle
- Edge (8, 6): Node 6 (3 connections), Node 8 (4 connections) -> Shared connection at Node 3
- Edge (9, 1): Node 1 (1 connection), Node 9 (1 connection) -> No triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, and <3, 6, 8>.
