Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections. After relabeling the vertices accordingly, the sorted list of vertices with their connections is:

Vertex 3: 1 connection (with 8)
Vertex 9: 1 connection (with 4)
Vertex 0: 2 connections (with 2, 5)
Vertex 6: 0 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections (with 0, 2, 4, 7)
Vertex 1: 4 connections (with 2, 4, 7, 8)
Vertex 2: 4 connections (with 0, 1, 5, 7)
Vertex 7: 4 connections (with 1, 2, 4, 5)
Vertex 8: 3 connections (with 1, 3, 5)
Vertex 4: 4 connections (with 1, 5, 7, 9)

Following the method, we consider only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Therefore, we analyze the edges in the following order:
(0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 5), (4, 9), (5, 8)
 
Now, let's count the triangles formed:

Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
Triangle 2: <1, 2, 4>
Triangle 3: <1, 2, 7>
Triangle 4: <1, 4, 7>
Triangle 5: <4, 5, 7>
Triangle 6: <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
