Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles efficiently by ordering the vertices based on their degrees. 

The degrees of each node are:  
Node 0: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 5  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 4  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 2  
Node 6: degree 1  
Node 7: degree 5  
Node 8: degree 2  
Node 9: degree 3  

Ordering the vertices from least to most connections: 6, 5, 8, 9, 2, 3, 4, 0, 7, 1 

After relabeling, the edges to consider based on the method are: (5, 2), (6, 5), (8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 0), (9, 7) 

Calculating the triangles formed by the selected edges:  
1. (5, 2): No triangles  
2. (6, 5): No triangles  
3. (8, 0): No triangles  
4. (8, 1): No triangles  
5. (9, 0): Triangle with node 9: <0, 8, 9>  
6. (9, 7): Triangle with node 9: <0, 7, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
