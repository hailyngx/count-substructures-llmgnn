Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on the number of connections:

Vertex 1: 0 connections
Vertex 6: 0 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections

Now, we will proceed by checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

3-7: Both have 5 connections. No triangle.
8-3: 3 has 5 connections while 8 has 2 connections. No triangle.
3-4: Both have 5 connections. No triangle.
3-5: Both have 5 connections. No triangle.
3-9: Both have 5 connections. No triangle.
7-2: Both have 4 connections. No triangle.
7-3: Both have 5 connections. No triangle.
7-5: 7 has 4 connections while 5 has 5 connections. Triangle <5, 7, 2>.
7-9: 7 has 4 connections while 9 has 5 connections. No triangle.
8-4: 4 has 5 connections while 8 has 2 connections. No triangle.
9-0: Both have 5 connections. No triangle.
9-2: 9 has 5 connections while 2 has 4 connections. No triangle.
9-3: 9 has 5 connections while 3 has 5 connections. No triangle.
9-7: 9 has 5 connections while 7 has 4 connections. No triangle.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
The unique triangle found is <5, 7, 2>.
