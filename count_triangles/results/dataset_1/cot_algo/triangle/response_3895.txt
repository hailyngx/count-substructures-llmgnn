Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 1 has 0 connections
- Node 3 has 0 connections
- Node 8 has 0 connections
- Node 5 has 1 connection
- Node 6 has 2 connections
- Node 2 has 3 connections
- Node 9 has 3 connections
- Node 0 has 5 connections
- Node 7 has 5 connections
- Node 4 has 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle <4, 7, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
