Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 0 (degree 5)
Vertex 1 (degree 2)
Vertex 2 (degree 3)
Vertex 3 (degree 4)
Vertex 4 (degree 5)
Vertex 5 (degree 5)
Vertex 6 (degree 3)
Vertex 7 (degree 4)
Vertex 8 (degree 3)
Vertex 9 (degree 4)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in this graph are as follows:
[6 triangles]
