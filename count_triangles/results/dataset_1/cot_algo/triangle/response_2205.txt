Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 2: 8 connections

Now, we'll count the triangles:

1. Looking at node 0 (2 connections) and its edges:
   - Edge (0, 2): Shared connection with node 2.
   - Edge (0, 5): No shared connection.
   - No triangles formed with node 0.

2. Looking at node 1 (2 connections) and its edges:
   - Edge (1, 2): Shared connection with node 2.
   - Edge (1, 3): No shared connection.
   - Edge (1, 6): No shared connection.
   - No triangles formed with node 1.

3. Looking at node 3 (2 connections) and its edges:
   - Edge (3, 1): No shared connection.
   - Edge (3, 5): Shared connection with node 5.
   - No triangles formed with node 3.

4. Looking at node 7 (1 connection) and its edge:
   - No triangles can be formed with node 7 due to its single connection.

5. Looking at node 5 (3 connections) and its edges:
   - Edge (5, 0): No shared connection.
   - Edge (5, 3): Shared connection with node 3.
   - Edge (5, 4): No shared connection.
   - No triangles formed with node 5.

6. Looking at node 4 (3 connections) and its edges:
   - Edge (4, 5): No shared connection.
   - Edge (4, 6): No shared connection.
   - Edge (4, 8): No shared connection.
   - No triangles formed with node 4.

7. Looking at node 9 (4 connections) and its edges:
   - Edge (9, 2): Shared connection with node 2.
   - Edge (9, 6): Shared connection with node 6.
   - Edge (9, 8): Shared connection with node 8.
   - Triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>.

8. Looking at node 8 (4 connections) and its edges:
   - Edge (8, 2): Shared connection with node 2.
   - Edge (8, 4): No shared connection.
   - Edge (8, 9): Shared connection with node 9.
   - No triangles can be formed with node 8.

9. Lastly, looking at node 6 (4 connections) and its edges:
   - Edge (6, 1): No shared connection.
   - Edge (6, 2): Shared connection with node 2.
   - Edge (6, 4): No shared connection.
   - Edge (6, 9): Shared connection with node 9.
   - Triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <2, 6, 9>.
