Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are reordered as follows based on their number of connections: 
Vertices: 3, 7, 1, 7, 0, 9, 5, 4, 2, 6

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed: 
- Edge (0, 5) forms triangles with nodes 4 and 8: <0, 4, 5>
- Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle with node 9: <1, 6, 9>
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4) forms a triangle with node 6: <2, 4, 6>
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
