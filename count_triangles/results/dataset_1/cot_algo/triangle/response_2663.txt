Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is:
Node 0 - 2 connections
Node 7 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 2 connections
Node 6 - 3 connections
Node 3 - 4 connections
Node 2 - 4 connections
Node 4 - 5 connections
Node 1 - 5 connections
Node 8 - 6 connections
Node 9 - 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Using this approach, we can count the number of triangles and identify the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles:
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 0, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<8, 9, 6>
