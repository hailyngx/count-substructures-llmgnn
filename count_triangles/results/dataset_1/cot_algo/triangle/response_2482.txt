Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting vertices by their degrees, the new ordering is:
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 9 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and analyzing the edges while ensuring the lower labeled node has fewer connections than the higher labeled node, we find the triangles:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 1>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 2>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 2>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
