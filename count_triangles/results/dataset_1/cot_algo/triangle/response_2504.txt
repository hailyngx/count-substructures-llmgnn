Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 1 has 0 connections.
- Vertex 0 has 1 connection.
- Vertex 6 has 1 connection.
- Vertex 4 has 0 connections.
- Vertex 8 has 1 connection.
- Vertex 9 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 2 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 5 has 4 connections.
- Vertex 7 has 4 connections.
- Vertex 3 has 4 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can analyze the given graph to count the number of triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles:
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
