Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order we get: 

Nodes: 2, 7, 8, 5, 6, 3, 1, 4, 0, 9

Reindexing the edges according to the new node numbering:

Edges: (2, 1) (7, 0) (8, 6) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (3, 1) (1, 0) (4, 0) (0, 9) (7, 8) (8, 9) (3, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (4, 1) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 4) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (9, 8) (5, 1) (3, 9) (1, 5)


Next, we will count the total number of triangles by identifying the triangles based on the degree-based ordering and shared connections:

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <7, 8, 9>
