Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for each vertex are: 

Node 0 - Degree 2  
Node 1 - Degree 2  
Node 3 - Degree 1  
Node 5 - Degree 2  
Node 7 - Degree 4  
Node 4 - Degree 3  
Node 8 - Degree 4  
Node 9 - Degree 4  
Node 6 - Degree 7  
Node 2 â€“ Degree 5  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we have:

1. (1, 2) shares a connection (9) with (2): Triangle <1, 2, 9>.
2. (1, 2) shares a connection (2) with (2): Triangle <1, 2, 2> (or equivalently <1, 2, 9>).
3. (1, 9) shares a connection (2) with (2): Triangle <1, 9, 2> (or equivalently <1, 2, 9>).
4. (2, 5) and (5, 8) share a connection (2) with (2): Triangle <2, 5, 8>.
5. (7, 0) and (0, 7) share a connection (6) with (6): Triangle <7, 0, 6>.
6. (7, 8) and (8, 7) share a connection (6) with (6): Triangle <7, 8, 6>.
7. (6, 8) and (8, 6) share a connection (5) with (5): Triangle <6, 8, 5>.
8. (6, 8) and (8, 6) share a connection (7) with (7): Triangle <6, 8, 7>.
9. (6, 7) and (7, 6) share a connection (0) with (0): Triangle <6, 7, 0>.
10. (6, 7) and (7, 6) share a connection (8) with (8): Triangle <6, 7, 8>.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
