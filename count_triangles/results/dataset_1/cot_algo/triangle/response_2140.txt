Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, we have the following order: 4, 1, 7, 6, 5, 9, 3, 8, 0, 2.

By following the degree-based ordering method, we find that there are 3 triangles in the given graph: 

[3]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
