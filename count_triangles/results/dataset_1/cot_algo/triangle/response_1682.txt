Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Nodes: 7, 4, 3, 6, 1, 2, 5, 0, 8, 9

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

1. Look at the edge (0, 7): Node 0 has connections with nodes 8 and 9, while node 7 has no other connections. No triangles are formed.

2. Edge (0, 8): Node 0 has connections with nodes 7 and 9, while node 8 has connections with nodes 3 and 9. No triangles are formed.

3. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 has connections with nodes 7 and 8, while node 9 has connections with nodes 5, 6, and 8. This forms a triangle <0, 8, 9>.

Similarly, continuing with the rest of the edges and applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can find all possible triangles. 

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
The unique triangle found is <0, 8, 9>.
