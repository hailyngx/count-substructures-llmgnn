Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections:

Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections

Following the method by checking for shared neighbors among edges that connect lower-degree vertices:
- Edge (0, 4): Shared neighbor with 1 -> Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Edge (1, 4): Already counted
- Edge (1, 7): Shared neighbor with 4 -> Triangle <1, 4, 7>
- Edge (1, 9): No shared neighbors
- Edge (2, 3): No shared neighbors
- Edge (2, 7): Shared neighbor with 3 -> Triangle <2, 3, 7>
- Edge (3, 4): Shared neighbor with 2 -> Triangle <2, 3, 4>
- Edge (4, 0): Already counted
- Edge (4, 1): Already counted
- Edge (4, 3): Already counted
- Edge (4, 7): Shared neighbors with 1 and 2 -> Triangle <1, 2, 4>, <2, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 7>
- Edge (6, 8): No shared neighbors
- Edge (6, 9): No shared neighbors
- Edge (7, 1): Already counted
- Edge (7, 2): Already counted
- Edge (7, 4): Already counted
- Edge (7, 8): No shared neighbors
- Edge (8, 6): No shared neighbors
- Edge (8, 7): No shared neighbors
- Edge (9, 1): No shared neighbors
- Edge (9, 6): No shared neighbors
