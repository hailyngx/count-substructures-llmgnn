Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:

Vertex 0 has 1 connection.
Vertex 2 has 0 connections.
Vertex 4 has 1 connection.
Vertex 9 has 2 connections.
Vertex 8 has 3 connections.
Vertex 7 has 3 connections.
Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
Vertex 3 has 4 connections.
Vertex 1 has 5 connections.
Vertex 5 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Checking the edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
2. Checking the edge (1, 3): No triangles formed.
3. Checking the edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
4. Checking the edge (1, 6): No triangles formed.
5. Checking the edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.
6. Checking the edge (3, 1): No triangles formed.
7. Checking the edge (3, 8): No triangles formed.
8. Checking the edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
9. Checking the edge (5, 0): No triangles formed.
10. Checking the edge (5, 1): No triangles formed.
11. Checking the edge (5, 6): Triangle formed: <5, 1, 6>.
12. Checking the edge (5, 7): Triangle formed: <5, 1, 7>.
13. Checking the edge (5, 8): Triangle formed: <5, 1, 8>.
14. Checking the edge (6, 1): Triangle formed: <6, 1, 5>.
15. Checking the edge (6, 5): No triangles formed.
16. Checking the edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
17. Checking the edge (7, 5): Triangle formed: <7, 1, 5>.
18. Checking the edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.
19. Checking the edge (8, 3): No triangles formed.
20. Checking the edge (8, 5): Triangle formed: <8, 1, 5>.
21. Checking the edge (9, 1): No triangles formed.
22. Checking the edge (9, 7): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
