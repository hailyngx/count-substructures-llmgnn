Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 2: 4 connections

Now, we'll relabel the vertices from 0 to 9 based on their number of connections (from least to most connections).

New node labels:
Node 0 (2 connections) -> New label 0
Node 7 (1 connection) -> New label 1
Node 4 (3 connections) -> New label 2
Node 6 (3 connections) -> New label 3
Node 3 (0 connections) -> New label 4
Node 5 (4 connections) -> New label 5
Node 8 (6 connections) -> New label 6
Node 1 (0 connections) -> New label 7
Node 9 (5 connections) -> New label 8
Node 2 (4 connections) -> New label 9

Now, we'll list the triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. <0, 9, 2>
2. <0, 9, 5>
3. <2, 4, 8>
4. <2, 5, 9>
5. <5, 8, 9>
6. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
