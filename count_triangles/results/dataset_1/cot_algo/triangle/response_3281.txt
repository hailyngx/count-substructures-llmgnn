Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 
Vertex 0 (Degree 2)
Vertex 3 (Degree 2)
Vertex 9 (Degree 2)
Vertex 5 (Degree 3)
Vertex 1 (Degree 4)
Vertex 4 (Degree 4)
Vertex 7 (Degree 4)
Vertex 6 (Degree 5)
Vertex 8 (Degree 5)
Vertex 2 (Degree 6)

Calculating the number of triangles:
For the (0, 7) edge: Shared connections with vertices 4 and 1. Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
For the (1, 2) edge: No triangles formed.
For the (1, 4) edge: No triangles formed.
For the (2, 1) edge: No triangles formed.
For the (2, 3) edge: No triangles formed.
For the (2, 4) edge: Shared connection with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 4>
For the (2, 6) edge: Shared connection with vertex 5. Triangle: <2, 5, 6>
For the (2, 8) edge: Shared connection with vertex 5. Triangle: <2, 5, 8>
For the (3, 2) edge: No triangles formed.
For the (4, 1) edge: No triangles formed.
For the (4, 2) edge: Shared connection with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 4>
For the (4, 7) edge: Shared connection with vertex 0. Triangle: <0, 4, 7>
For the (5, 6) edge: No triangles formed.
For the (5, 8) edge: No triangles formed.
For the (6, 2) edge: Shared connection with vertices 5 and 8. Triangles: <2, 5, 6> and <2, 6, 8>
For the (6, 5) edge: No triangles formed.
For the (6, 8) edge: No triangles formed.
For the (7, 0) edge: Shared connection with vertex 4. Triangle: <0, 4, 7>
For the (7, 4) edge: Shared connection with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 4, 7>
For the (7, 9) edge: No triangles formed.
For the (8, 2) edge: Shared connection with vertices 5 and 6. Triangles: <2, 5, 8> and <2, 6, 8>
For the (8, 5) edge: No triangles formed.
For the (8, 6) edge: No triangles formed.
For the (9, 7) edge: No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 8>.
