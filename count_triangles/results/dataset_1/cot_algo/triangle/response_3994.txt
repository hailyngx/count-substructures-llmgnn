Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order, then relabeling them accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices along with their degree is:
Vertex 1 (degree 2): 1
Vertex 3 (degree 2): 2
Vertex 8 (degree 2): 3
Vertex 7 (degree 2): 4
Vertex 9 (degree 2): 5
Vertex 4 (degree 2): 6
Vertex 5 (degree 3): 7
Vertex 6 (degree 4): 8
Vertex 0 (degree 4): 9

Now, let's go through the edges in the order of the sorted vertices and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

1. Edge (1, 4): No triangle
2. Edge (1, 9): No triangle
3. Edge (2, 4): No triangle
4. Edge (3, 9): No triangle
5. Edge (4, 7): No triangle
6. Edge (5, 6): No triangle
7. Edge (5, 8): No triangle
8. Edge (6, 7): No triangle
9. Edge (6, 8): No triangle
10. Edge (6, 9): Triangle <0, 6, 9>
11. Edge (7, 9): No triangle
12. Edge (8, 9): No triangle
13. Edge (9, 0): No triangle
14. Edge (9, 3): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <0, 6, 9>
