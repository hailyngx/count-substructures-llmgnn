Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling:

Node 1: 9 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:

(9, 5), (9, 8), (3, 0), (3, 8), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8), (4, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 2), (8, 5), (8, 0)

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 2>
<1, 6, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 0>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 6>
<5, 8, 0>
<6, 7, 2>
<6, 7, 5>
<8, 5, 0>
<8, 5, 2>
<8, 0, 4>
