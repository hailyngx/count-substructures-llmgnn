Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After relabeling the nodes based on their degree, the graph is as follows:

Nodes:
0 (degree 4)
1 (degree 5)
2 (degree 4)
3 (degree 2)
4 (degree 5)
5 (degree 5)
6 (degree 1)
7 (degree 4)
8 (degree 2)
9 (degree 3)

Edges (based on new labels):
(0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5)
(1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5)
(2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7)
(3, 5)
(4, 8) (4, 9)
(5, 7)
(6, 8)
(7, 9)

Now, let's count the triangles based on the connections:

Triangles: 22
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 5> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [22].
