Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

Using the degree-based ordering, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles.
After counting, we find that there are:
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>]
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is:
