Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Vertex 8 (degree 0): 9
Vertex 0 (degree 2): 0, 6
Vertex 1 (degree 2): 1
Vertex 6 (degree 2): 3
Vertex 9 (degree 2): 4
Vertex 7 (degree 6): 2, 5, 7

Applying the method:
- Edge (0, 5): Check 0 and 5: 2 forms a triangle. Triangle <0, 2, 5>.
- Edge (0, 7): Check 0 and 7: No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 7): Check 1 and 7: No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 3): Check 2 and 3: No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 4): Check 2 and 4: 5 forms a triangle. Triangle <2, 4, 5>.
- Edge (2, 5): Check 2 and 5: 0 forms a triangle. Triangle <0, 2, 5>.
- Edge (2, 7): Check 2 and 7: No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 2): Proceed based on method.
- Edge (3, 4): No need to check as this configuration is already covered.
- Edge (3, 7): Check 3 and 7: 4 forms a triangle. Triangle <3, 4, 7>.
- Edge (4, 2): Proceed based on method.
- Edge (4, 3): Proceed based on method.
- Edge (4, 5): No need to check as this configuration is already covered.
- Edge (4, 6): No need to check as this configuration is already covered.
- Edge (4, 7): Check 4 and 7: 5 forms a triangle. Triangle <4, 5, 7>.
- Edges involving vertices 5, 6, 7, 9 have already been checked.
  
Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <3, 4, 7>
