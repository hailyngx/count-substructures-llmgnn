Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the nodes by their degree:

Node 0 has degree 1
Node 1 has degree 1
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 6
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 5
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 4

Relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 0 -> 0
Node 1 -> 1
Node 2 -> 2
Node 3 -> 8
Node 4 -> 6
Node 5 -> 7
Node 6 -> 3
Node 7 -> 4
Node 8 -> 5
Node 9 -> 9

Now, we will analyze each edge based on the degree-based ordering:

(0, 3): No triangles
(1, 5): No triangles
(2, 9): No triangles
(3, 8): No triangles
(3, 4): No triangles
(3, 5): Forms a triangle: <3, 5, 7>
(3, 6): No triangles
(3, 9): No triangles
(4, 8): No triangles
(5, 7): Forms a triangle: <5, 7, 9>
(6, 7): No triangles
(8, 9): No triangles

The total number of triangles is [2].
Triangles found: <3, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 9>.
