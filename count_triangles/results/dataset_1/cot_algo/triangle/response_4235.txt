Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we will first sort the vertices based on the number of connections:

0: 4 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 1 connection
9: 3 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

0 -> 8
1 -> 2
2 -> 5
3 -> 1
4 -> 4
5 -> 7
6 -> 3
7 -> 6
8 -> 0
9 -> 9

Now, we will count the triangles by checking for shared connections between vertices of each edge:

- For edge (0, 1): Shared connection with node 6. Triangle: <0, 1, 6>
- For edge (0, 8): No shared connection for counting triangles.
- For edge (0, 9): No shared connection for counting triangles.
- For edge (1, 3): Shared connection with node 0. Triangle: <1, 3, 0>
- For edge (2, 4): No shared connection for counting triangles.
- For edge (2, 7): No shared connection for counting triangles.
- For edge (3, 6): Shared connection with node 0. Triangle: <3, 6, 0>
- For edge (3, 7): No shared connection for counting triangles.
- For edge (3, 9): No shared connection for counting triangles.
- For edge (4, 5): No shared connection for counting triangles.
- For edge (4, 6): No shared connection for counting triangles.
- For edge (5, 7): No shared connection for counting triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6> and <1, 3, 0>.
