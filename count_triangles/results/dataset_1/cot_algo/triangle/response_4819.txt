Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices with their degree is as follows:
(0: 1), (9: 1), (8: 1), (7: 2), (4: 2), (6: 2), (5: 3), (3: 3), (1: 4), (2: 4)

Now, we will go through the edges in the same order and count the triangles formed:

1. (0, 5): No triangle formed.
2. (1, 2): No triangle formed.
3. (1, 3): Triangle <1, 3, 6>.
4. (1, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 9>.
5. (1, 5): No triangle formed.
6. (2, 1): No triangle formed.
7. (2, 6): Triangle <2, 3, 6>.
8. (2, 8): No triangle formed.
9. (3, 1): No triangle formed.
10. (3, 6): Triangle <3, 6, 2>.
11. (3, 7): Triangle <3, 7, 5>.
12. (4, 1): No triangle formed.
13. (4, 9): No triangle formed.
14. (5, 0): No triangle formed.
15. (5, 1): No triangle formed.
16. (5, 7): Triangle <5, 7, 3>.
17. (6, 2): No triangle formed.
18. (6, 3): No triangle formed.
19. (7, 3): No triangle formed.
20. (7, 5): No triangle formed.
21. (8, 2): No triangle formed.
22. (9, 4): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 7, 5>.
