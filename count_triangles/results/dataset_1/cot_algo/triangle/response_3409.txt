Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling of vertices becomes: 
Vertices: 2, 8, 0, 7, 4, 6, 5, 9, 1, 3

The given edges that meet the criteria (vertex with lower label has fewer connections) are:
(0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 9), (2, 3), (3, 9), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 9), (7, 8)

Now, counting the triangles formed by the shared connections between the vertices of each edge:
- For edge (0, 1): Shared connection with vertex 9 forms a triangle <0, 1, 9>
- For edge (0, 8): No triangles
- For edge (1, 9): No triangles
- For edge (2, 3): No triangles
- For edge (3, 9): No triangles
- For edge (4, 6): No triangles
- For edge (5, 6): No triangles
- For edge (5, 7): No triangles
- For edge (6, 9): No triangles
- For edge (7, 8): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 1, 9>.
