Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 7 (Degree 1)
Node 2 (Degree 2)
Node 3 (Degree 3)
Node 4 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 4)
Node 5 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 6)
Node 8 (Degree 5)
Node 9 (Degree 4)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles.

There are [5] triangles in total.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
