Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we go through each edge in order and check for triangles. 

Checking edge (0, 6): 
Node 0 does not have less connections than Node 6.

Checking edge (1, 2): 
Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 2. 
Shared connections between Node 1 and Node 2: Node 3
Triangle found: <1, 2, 3>

Checking edge (1, 3): 
Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 3.
Shared connections between Node 1 and Node 3: Node 4
Triangle found: <1, 3, 4>

Checking edge (1, 9): 
Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 9. No triangle found.

Checking edge (2, 3): Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 3. No triangle found.

Checking edge (2, 4): 
Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 4.
Shared connections between Node 2 and Node 4: Node 3, 8
Triangles found: <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 8>

Checking edge (2, 6): 
Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 6.
Shared connections between Node 2 and Node 6: Node 0
Triangle found: <2, 6, 0>

Checking edge (2, 8): 
Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 8.
Shared connections between Node 2 and Node 8: Node 4, 5
Triangle found: <2, 8, 4>, <2, 8, 5>

Checking edge (3, 4): 
Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 4. No triangle found.

Checking edge (4, 8): 
Node 4 has fewer connections than Node 8. No triangle found.

Checking edge (5, 6): 
Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 6.
Shared connections between Node 5 and Node 6: Node 8
Triangle found: <5, 6, 8>

Checking edge (5, 8): 
Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 8. No triangle found.

Checking edge (8, 9): 
Node 8 has fewer connections than Node 9. No triangle found.

After examining all edges, the total number of triangles found is [6].
