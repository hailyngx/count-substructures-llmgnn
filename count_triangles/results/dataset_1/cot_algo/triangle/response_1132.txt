Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices based on their degree is:
0 (degree 3)
9 (degree 1)
6 (degree 1)
7 (degree 1)
5 (degree 2)
3 (degree 2)
2 (degree 3)
1 (degree 3)
8 (degree 4)
4 (degree 4)

Using the sorted list, we can now count the number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
