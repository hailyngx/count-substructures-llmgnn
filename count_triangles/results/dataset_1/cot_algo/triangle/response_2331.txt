Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new vertex order is: 3, 6, 8, 9, 5, 2, 4, 1, 7, 0.

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Triangle <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle <0, 1, 7>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
