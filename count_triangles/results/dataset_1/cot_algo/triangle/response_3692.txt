Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertices: 4, 1, 7, 6, 3, 5, 0, 8, 2, 9

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with vertex 0 -> {4, 5}
2. Edge (0, 4): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (0, 5): Shared connections with vertex 0 -> {2, 7}
4. Edge (0, 7): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (0, 9): Shared connections with vertex 0 -> {2}
6. Edge (1, 2): Shared connections with vertex 1 -> {5}
7. Edge (1, 5): Shared connections with vertex 1 -> {2}
8. Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (2, 8): Shared connections with vertex 2 -> {1}
10. Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (5, 7): Shared connections with vertex 5 -> {0}
13. Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (8, 9): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5], and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 5>.
