Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels are:  

Node 0: degree 2  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 7: degree 2  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 2  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 7  
Node 2: degree 6  

The edges to consider based on the given conditions are:  
(0, 2)  
(0, 3)  
(1, 2)  
(1, 4)  
(1, 5)  
(1, 6)  
(1, 8)  
(2, 0)  
(2, 1)  
(2, 5)  
(2, 6)  
(3, 0)  
(3, 4)  
(3, 5)  
(4, 7)  
(5, 1)  
(5, 3)  
(5, 9)  
(6, 1)  
(6, 7)  
(7, 4)  
(8, 1)  
(8, 9)  
(9, 5)  
(9, 8)  

By checking shared connections, we find the following triangles:  
<1, 2, 5>  
<1, 2, 6>  
<1, 3, 5>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
