Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, we relabel them as follows:
Vertex 0 -> Degree 3
Vertex 1 -> Degree 2
Vertex 2 -> Degree 2
Vertex 4 -> Degree 1
Vertex 6 -> Degree 1
Vertex 9 -> Degree 1
Vertex 7 -> Degree 3
Vertex 5 -> Degree 2
Vertex 8 -> Degree 5
Vertex 3 -> Degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 0), (7, 4), and (7, 8) as only these edges have a lower degree vertex connected to a higher degree vertex.

By analyzing the shared connections between vertices connected by these edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
