Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding degrees are:
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 1
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 5
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 5
Vertex 9: degree 3

Reordering the vertices based on their degrees:
Node ordering: 3, 2, 0, 1, 9, 7, 6, 4, 8, 5
