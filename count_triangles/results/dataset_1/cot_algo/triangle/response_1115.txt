Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following labels:  
Vertex 0: degree 2  
Vertex 4: degree 2  
Vertex 7: degree 2  
Vertex 8: degree 1  
Vertex 9: degree 1  
Vertex 3: degree 3  
Vertex 2: degree 4  
Vertex 6: degree 4  
Vertex 1: degree 7  
Vertex 5: degree 7  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will process the edges in the following order:  
(8, 7), (9, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 5), (0, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6), (0, 6), (3, 6), (6, 5), (1, 9), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3)  

By following the above order, we find the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [2]. The unique triangles found are:  
<1, 6, 5>  
<1, 5, 4>
