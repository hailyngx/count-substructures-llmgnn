Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 6 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections

Now we relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:

Vertex 2 (1 connection) -> relabeled as 0
Vertex 4 (1 connection) -> relabeled as 1
Vertex 0 (2 connections) -> relabeled as 2
Vertex 1 (2 connections) -> relabeled as 3
Vertex 7 (3 connections) -> relabeled as 4
Vertex 9 (3 connections) -> relabeled as 5
Vertex 5 (2 connections) -> relabeled as 6
Vertex 8 (4 connections) -> relabeled as 7
Vertex 3 (4 connections) -> relabeled as 8
Vertex 6 (6 connections) -> relabeled as 9

Based on the sorted labels, we can start counting the triangles:

Triangles:
<3, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
