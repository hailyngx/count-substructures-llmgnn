Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges can be represented as follows:

```
    5 -- 0 -- 7
    |    |  
    4 -- 2 -- 9 -- 1
    |    |
    6 -- 3    8
```

Now, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Sort the vertices by their degree:
   - Vertices with degree 2: 1, 3, 8, 5, 7
   - Vertices with degree 3: 0, 6
   - Vertices with degree 4: 4, 9, 2

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degree:
   - 1, 3, 8, 5, 7 -> 0
   - 0, 6 -> 1
   - 4, 9, 2 -> 2

3. Checking for triangles:
   - (0, 2) with (2, 4) forms a triangle with vertex 2, shared connections: 4, 9
   - (0, 5) with (5, 4) forms a triangle with vertex 0, shared connections: 5
   - (0, 7) with (7, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 0, shared connections: 7
   - (0, 2) with (2, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 2, shared connections: 9
   - (2, 4) with (4, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 4, shared connections: 6
   - (2, 9) with (9, 1) forms a triangle with vertex 2, shared connections: 9
   - (4, 9) with (9, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 4, shared connections: 9
   - (6, 4) with (4, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 4, shared connections: 6
   - (9, 6) with (6, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 6, shared connections: 9

4. Counting the total number of triangles: 
   There are a total of 9 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the output should be: [9]  
And the unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 9, 1>, <4, 6, 2>, <9, 6, 4>, <4, 5, 6>, <6, 8, 9>
