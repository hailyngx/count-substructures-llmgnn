Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labeling becomes:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we identify the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle <5, 6, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
