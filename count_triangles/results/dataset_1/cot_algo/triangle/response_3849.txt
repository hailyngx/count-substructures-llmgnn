Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are:
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 3), (9, 3), (6, 4), (4, 6), (0, 5), (2, 5), (4, 9), (8, 3), (0, 6), (2, 6), (5, 0), (8, 0), (4, 0), (7, 0), (0, 8), (8, 2), (2, 0), (2, 8), (6, 0), (0, 4)
