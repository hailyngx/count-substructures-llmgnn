Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0 has 3 connections
- Node 6 has 3 connections
- Node 2 has 4 connections
- Node 7 has 4 connections
- Node 8 has 4 connections
- Node 9 has 4 connections
- Node 1 has 5 connections
- Node 5 has 5 connections
- Node 3 has 6 connections
- Node 4 has 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:
1. (0, 4): Shared connections with 5 form a triangle <0, 4, 5>.
2. (0, 5): No additional triangle.
3. (0, 9): No additional triangle.
4. (1, 2): No additional triangle.
5. (1, 3): No additional triangle.
6. (1, 4): Shared connections with 9 form a triangle <1, 4, 9>.
7. (1, 9): No additional triangle.
8. (2, 5): Shared connections with 3 form a triangle <2, 3, 5>.
9. (2, 6): No additional triangle.
10. (3, 5): No additional triangle.
11. (3, 7): No additional triangle.
12. (3, 9): No additional triangle.
13. (4, 8): Shared connections with 6 form a triangle <4, 6, 8>.
14. (5, 7): Shared connections with 8 form a triangle <5, 7, 8>.
15. (7, 8): Shared connections with 6 form a triangle <6, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
