Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can help us count the triangles efficiently in this graph. 
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertices: 4, 7, 8, 0, 6, 9, 5, 1, 2, 3

Calculating the triangles based on the connections:
1. For edge (0, 1):
   - Vertex 0: Connected to 1, 2, 3
   - Vertex 1: Connected to 0, 2, 3, 5
   Shared connections: 2, 3
   Triangle: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>

2. For edge (0, 2):
   - Vertex 0: Connected to 1, 2, 3
   - Vertex 2: Connected to 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
   Shared connections: 0, 3
   Triangle: <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 3>

3. For edge (0, 3):
   - Vertex 0: Connected to 1, 2, 3
   - Vertex 3: Connected to 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
   Shared connections: 0, 1, 2
   Triangle: <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 9>

4. For edge (1, 2):
   - Vertex 1: Connected to 0, 2, 3, 5
   - Vertex 2: Connected to 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
   Shared connections: 5
   Triangle: <1, 2, 0>, <1, 2, 3>

5. For edge (1, 3):
   - Vertex 1: Connected to 0, 2, 3, 5
   - Vertex 3: Connected to 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
   Shared connections: 0, 2
   Triangle: <1, 3, 0>, <1, 3, 2>

6. For edge (2, 3):
   - Vertex 2: Connected to 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
   - Vertex 3: Connected to 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
   Shared connections: 6
   Triangle: <2, 3, 0>, <2, 3, 1>

The total number of triangles is [9].
