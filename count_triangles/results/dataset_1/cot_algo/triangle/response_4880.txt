Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 1

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will relabel the nodes as follows:
- Node 0 -> Node 3
- Node 1 -> Node 8
- Node 2 -> Node 4
- Node 3 -> Node 0
- Node 4 -> Node 9
- Node 5 -> Node 5
- Node 6 -> Node 2
- Node 7 -> Node 1
- Node 8 -> Node 6
- Node 9 -> Node 7

Now, let's list the edges in order of the relabeled nodes:
(3, 8), (3, 0), (3, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6), (0, 3), (9, 8), (9, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (2, 8), (2, 4), (1, 8), (4, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 2), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 1), (1, 3), (4, 3)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle <1, 7, 8>
- Triangle <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
