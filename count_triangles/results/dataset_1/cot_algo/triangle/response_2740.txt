Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are: 

Node 1: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:

1. <2, 0, 8>
2. <2, 3, 4>
3. <3, 4, 7>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <3, 6, 4>
6. <4, 6, 5>
7. <9, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
