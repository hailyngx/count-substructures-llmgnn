Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree from least to most connections:
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:
Node 6 (0 connections) -> Node 0
Node 1 (2 connections) -> Node 1
Node 7 (3 connections) -> Node 2
Node 5 (4 connections) -> Node 3
Node 9 (4 connections) -> Node 4
Node 4 (4 connections) -> Node 5
Node 8 (5 connections) -> Node 6
Node 3 (5 connections) -> Node 7
Node 2 (6 connections) -> Node 8
Node 0 (6 connections) -> Node 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
[12]

Unique triangles:
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<8, 4, 9>
<8, 5, 9>
