Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Then, we can proceed to count the triangles by inspecting the edges based on the labels of the vertices involved.

Here is the step-by-step process to count the triangles:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
    - Vertex 3 has 2 connections.
    - Vertices 8 and 9 have 2 connections.
    - Vertices 7 and 6 have 3 connections.
    - Vertices 1 and 2 have 4 connections.
    - Vertices 0 and 5 have the highest degree with 5 connections.

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
    - Vertex 0 (Degree 5)
    - Vertex 5 (Degree 5)
    - Vertex 1 (Degree 4)
    - Vertex 2 (Degree 4)
    - Vertex 7 (Degree 3)
    - Vertex 6 (Degree 3)
    - Vertex 3 (Degree 2)
    - Vertex 8 (Degree 2)
    - Vertex 9 (Degree 2)
    - Vertex 4 (Degree 0)

3. Analyze the edges starting from the vertices with the lower label:
    - Vertex 0 (Degree 5):
        - Forms triangles with vertices 1, 2, 4, and 7.
    - Vertex 5 (Degree 5):
        - Forms triangles with vertices 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
    - Vertex 1 (Degree 4):
        - Forms triangles with vertices 4 and 8.
    - Vertex 2 (Degree 4):
        - Forms triangles with vertex 5.
    - Vertex 7 (Degree 3):
        - Does not form any triangles.
    - Vertex 6 (Degree 3):
        - Does not form any triangles.
    - Vertex 3 (Degree 2):
        - Does not form any triangles.
    - Vertex 8 (Degree 2):
        - Does not form any triangles.
    - Vertex 9 (Degree 2):
        - Does not form any triangles.
    - Vertex 4 (Degree 0):
        - Does not form any triangles.

4. Count the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 14
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 4>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 0>, <1, 2, 5>, <5, 8, 1>, <5, 9, 6>, <5, 6, 3>, <5, 4, 0>, <5, 3, 6>.
