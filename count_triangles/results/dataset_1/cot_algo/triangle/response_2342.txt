Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices in ascending order of degree: 3, 5, 8, 0, 4, 7, 2, 6, 1, 9

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on this order:

Node 3 → A
Node 5 → B
Node 8 → C
Node 0 → D
Node 4 → E
Node 7 → F
Node 2 → G
Node 6 → H
Node 1 → I
Node 9 → J

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

(0, 7): Both 0 and 7 are connected to 1, forming triangle <0, 1, 7>
(0, 8): No triangle
(1, 6): No triangle
(1, 7): Edge skipped (Degree condition)
(1, 8): Edge skipped (Degree condition)
(1, 9): No triangle
(2, 4): No triangle
(2, 7): No triangle
(3, 9): No triangle
(4, 2): No triangle
(5, 6): No triangle
(5, 9): No triangle
(6, 1): Edge skipped (Degree condition)
(6, 5): No triangle
(6, 9): No triangle
(7, 0): Edge skipped (Degree condition)
(7, 1): Edge skipped (Degree condition)
(7, 2): No triangle
(8, 0): Edge skipped (Degree condition)
(8, 1): Edge skipped (Degree condition)
(9, 1): Edge skipped (Degree condition)
(9, 3): No triangle
(9, 5): No triangle
(9, 6): No triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 1, 7>.
