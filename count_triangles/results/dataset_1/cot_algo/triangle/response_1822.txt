Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, we get the following new labels for the vertices:
Vertices: 9, 3, 5, 7, 8, 4, 0, 1, 6, 2

Now, we will analyze each edge according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 1): Both vertices are connected to vertex 9. Triangle found: <0, 1, 9>
- Edge (0, 2): Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 3 and 4. Triangle found: <0, 2, 3> and <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (0, 3): No new triangles found.
- Edge (0, 4): No new triangles found.
- Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1 and 9. Triangle found: <0, 6, 1> and <0, 6, 9>
- Edge (1, 6): No new triangles found.
- Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 9. Triangle found: <1, 7, 9>
- Edge (1, 9): No new triangles found.
- Edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 5. Triangle found: <2, 3, 5>
- Edge (2, 5): No new triangles found.
- Edge (2, 8): Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 9. Triangle found: <2, 8, 9>
- Edge (2, 9): No new triangles found.
- Edge (4, 5): No new triangles found.
- Edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 1. Triangle found: <4, 7, 1>
- Edge (5, 9): No new triangles found.
- Edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 9. Triangle found: <6, 8, 9>
- Edge (6, 9): No new triangles found.
- Edge (7, 9): No new triangles found.
- Edge (8, 9): No new triangles found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8] and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, and <2, 8, 9>.
