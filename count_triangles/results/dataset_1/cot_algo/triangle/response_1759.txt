Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on the number of connections:

Node 7: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 5

Next, we will traverse the edges based on the sorted order and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge: (0, 5)
    Shared connections: None

2. Edge: (0, 9)
    Shared connections: None

3. Edge: (1, 3)
    Shared connections: None

4. Edge: (1, 6)
    Shared connections: None

5. Edge: (1, 8)
    Shared connections: None

6. Edge: (2, 9)
    Shared connections: None

7. Edge: (3, 1)
    Shared connections: None

8. Edge: (3, 4)
    Shared connections: None

9. Edge: (4, 3)
    Shared connections: None

10. Edge: (5, 0)
    Shared connections: None

11. Edge: (5, 8)
    Shared connections: <0, 5, 8> 

12. Edge: (6, 1)
    Shared connections: None

13. Edge: (6, 8)
    Shared connections: <1, 6, 8>

14. Edge: (7, 8)
    Shared connections: None

15. Edge: (8, 1)
    Shared connections: None

16. Edge: (8, 5)
    Shared connections: <0, 5, 8>

17. Edge: (8, 6)
    Shared connections: <1, 6, 8>

18. Edge: (8, 7)
    Shared connections: None

19. Edge: (9, 0)
    Shared connections: None

20. Edge: (9, 2)
    Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 8>
