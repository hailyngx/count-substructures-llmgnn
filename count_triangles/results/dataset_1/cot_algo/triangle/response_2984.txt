Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 4: degree 5

Now, we can proceed with counting the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method:

Triangles:
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 1, 7>
- <4, 1, 5>
- <5, 0, 6>
- <6, 2, 5>

Total number of triangles: [10]
