Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes based on their degree, we get the following labels for the nodes:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 6: degree 1
Node 2: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 8: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 9: degree 5
Node 1: degree 6
Node 3: degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles.

[Total number of triangles: 8]
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
