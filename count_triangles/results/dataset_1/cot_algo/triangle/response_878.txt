Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be:
```
Vertex 5: Degree 2
Vertex 1: Degree 2
Vertex 2: Degree 2
Vertex 6: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 4: Degree 6
```

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge:

1. Edge (0, 4): Both 0 and 4 are connected to 1 and 3, forming triangle <0, 1, 3>.
2. Edge (0, 8): No triangles can be formed.
3. Edge (0, 9): Both 0 and 9 are connected to 3, forming triangle <0, 3, 9>.
4. Edge (1, 4): Both 1 and 4 are connected to 0 and 3, forming triangle <1, 0, 3>.
5. Edge (3, 4): Both 3 and 4 are connected to 0 and 1, forming triangle <3, 0, 1>.
6. Edge (3, 7): Both 3 and 7 are connected to 5, forming triangle <3, 5, 7>.
7. Edge (3, 9): Both 3 and 9 are connected to 0, forming triangle <3, 0, 9>.
8. Edge (4, 0): Already counted in edge (0, 4).
9. Edge (4, 1): Already counted in edge (1, 4).
10. Edge (4, 3): Already counted in edge (3, 4).
11. Edge (5, 6): No triangles can be formed.
12. Edge (5, 7): Both 5 and 7 are connected to 3, forming triangle <5, 3, 7>.
13. Edge (6, 5): No triangles can be formed.
14. Edge (6, 8): No triangles can be formed.
15. Edge (7, 3): Already counted in edge (3, 7).
16. Edge (7, 5): Already counted in edge (5, 7).
17. Edge (8, 0): Already counted in edge (0, 8).
18. Edge (8, 6): No triangles can be formed.
19. Edge (9, 0): Already counted in edge (0, 9).
20. Edge (9, 3): Already counted in edge (3, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 0, 3>, <3, 0, 1>, <3, 5, 7>.
