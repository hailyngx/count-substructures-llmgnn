Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new vertex labels are as follows:
- Node 6: Degree 0
- Node 4: Degree 1
- Node 8: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 0: Degree 6
- Node 9: Degree 8

The triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method are:
- <4, 7, 9>
- <4, 2, 9>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 0, 9>
- <0, 8, 5>
- <0, 9, 5>
- <9, 5, 2>
- <9, 6, 0>
- <9, 3, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
