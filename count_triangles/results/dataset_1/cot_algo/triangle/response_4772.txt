Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the graph are:
