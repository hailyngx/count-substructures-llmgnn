Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Reordering the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connections:
Nodes: 1, 9, 6, 7, 3, 6, 0, 2, 5, 8, 4

Calculating the triangles:
- For edge (1, 4): Node 1 has 2 connections and node 4 has 5 connections. Shared connection with nodes 0 and 8. Triangle formed: <1, 0, 8>.
- For edge (9, 0): Node 9 has 1 connection and node 0 has 6 connections. Shared connection with node 8. Triangle formed: <9, 0, 8>.

Total number of triangles: [2]
