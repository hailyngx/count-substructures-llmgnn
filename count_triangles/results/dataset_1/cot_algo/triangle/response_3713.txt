Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 4: 0 connection
Node 5: 0 connection
Node 8: 0 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections

Following the degree-based ordering, we will proceed with the edges in the order of node connections:
(0, 1) - Shared connections: []

(0, 3) - Shared connections: [<0, 3, 6>]

(0, 6) - Shared connections: []

(0, 7) - Shared connections: []

(0, 9) - Shared connections: []

(1, 3) - Shared connections: []

(1, 6) - Shared connections: []

(2, 6) - Shared connections: [<2, 6, 9>]

(2, 7) - Shared connections: []

(2, 8) - Shared connections: []

(2, 9) - Shared connections: []

(3, 5) - Shared connections: []

(3, 7) - Shared connections: []

(3, 9) - Shared connections: [<0, 3, 9>]

(5, 6) - Shared connections: []

(6, 7) - Shared connections: []

(6, 9) - Shared connections: []

(7, 8) - Shared connections: []

(8, 9) - Shared connections: []

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [4]

Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <0, 3, 9>.
