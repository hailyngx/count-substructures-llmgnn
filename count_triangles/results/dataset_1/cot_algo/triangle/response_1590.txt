Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices in descending order based on their degrees:
Vertices: 5, 7, 9, 6, 0, 8, 1, 4, 2, 3 

Now, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:
1. Edge (0, 3): Both nodes have degree 3, but 0 has fewer connections.
   Shared connections for (0, 3): 1
2. Edge (0, 8): 0 has degree 3 < 4 for 8.
   Shared connections for (0, 8): 1
3. Edge (1, 3): 1 has degree 4 > 3 for 3. Skip.
4. Edge (1, 4): 1 has degree 4 > 3 for 4. Skip.
5. Edge (1, 7): 1 has degree 4 > 2 for 7. Skip.
6. Edge (1, 8): 1 has degree 4 > 3 for 8. Skip.
7. Edge (2, 4): 2 has degree 3 < 4 for 4.
   Shared connections for (2, 4): 1
8. Edge (2, 5): 2 has degree 3 < 4 for 5.
   Shared connections for (2, 5): None
9. Edge (2, 6): 2 has degree 3 < 2 for 6.
   Shared connections for (2, 6): None
10. Edge (3, 0): 3 has degree 4 > 3 for 0. Skip.
11. Edge (3, 1): 3 has degree 4 > 4 for 1. Skip.
12. Edge (3, 4): Both nodes have degree 3, but 3 has fewer connections.
   Shared connections for (3, 4): 1
13. Edge (4, 1): 4 has degree 4 > 4 for 1. Skip.
14. Edge (4, 2): 4 has degree 4 > 3 for 2. Skip.
15. Edge (4, 3): Both nodes have degree 3, but 3 has fewer connections.
   Shared connections for (4, 3): 1
16. Edge (4, 9): 4 has degree 4 > 2 for 9.
   Shared connections for (4, 9): None
17. Edge (5, 2): 5 has degree 3 < 4 for 2.
   Shared connections for (5, 2): None
18. Edge (5, 7): 5 has degree 3 < 2 for 7.
   Shared connections for (5, 7): None
19. Edge (5, 9): 5 has degree 3 < 2 for 9.
   Shared connections for (5, 9): None
20. Edge (6, 2): 6 has degree 2 < 4 for 2.
   Shared connections for (6, 2): None
21. Edge (7, 1): 7 has degree 2 < 4 for 1.
   Shared connections for (7, 1): None
22. Edge (7, 5): 7 has degree 2 < 3 for 5.
   Shared connections for (7, 5): None
23. Edge (8, 0): 8 has degree 3 < 4 for 0.
   Shared connections for (8, 0): 1
24. Edge (8, 1): 8 has degree 3 < 4 for 1.
   Shared connections for (8, 1): None
25. Edge (9, 4): 9 has degree 2 < 4 for 4.
   Shared connections for (9, 4): None
26. Edge (9, 5): 9 has degree 2 < 3 for 5.
   Shared connections for (9, 5): None

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 3>
