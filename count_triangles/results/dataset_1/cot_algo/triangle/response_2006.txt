Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by the number of connections they have:
Node 0 has 1 connection
Node 3 has 1 connection
Nodes 5, 6, and 9 have 2 connections
Nodes 7 and 4 have 3 connections
Nodes 1 and 2 have 5 connections
Node 8 has 6 connections

The sorted list of nodes becomes: 0, 3, 5, 6, 9, 7, 4, 1, 2, 8.

Now we will go through the edges and count the triangles formed:
- Edge (0, 1) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (1, 6) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (1, 8) forms 1 triangle: <1, 6, 8>.
- Edge (2, 4) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (2, 8) forms 1 triangle: <2, 1, 8>.
- Edge (2, 9) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 5) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 8) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (4, 2) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (4, 7) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (7, 5) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (7, 8) forms 1 triangle: <7, 1, 8>.
- Edge (9, 6) doesn't form any triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [3].
