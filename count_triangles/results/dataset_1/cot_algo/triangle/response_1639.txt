Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 6
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 9: Degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<3, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
