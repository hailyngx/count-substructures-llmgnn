Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, we get the following list: 

Vertices: 0, 4, 8, 9, 5, 6, 7, 1, 3, 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph.

Count of triangles: 4

Unique triangles: <1, 3, 2>, <1, 7, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 1, 7>
