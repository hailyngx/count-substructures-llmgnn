Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, we start counting the triangles:
- Triangle <4, 8, 9>
- Triangle <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
