Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:

Vertex 3: degree 1
Vertex 2: degree 1
Vertex 6: degree 1
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 5
Vertex 0: degree 5
Vertex 9: degree 6
Vertex 7: degree 6

We will now go through the edges and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): 
    - Both 0 and 1 are connected to 7.
    - Triangle: <0, 1, 7>

2. Edge (0, 7):
    - Both 0 and 7 are connected to 9.
    - Triangle: <0, 7, 9>

3. Edge (0, 9): 
    - Both 0 and 9 are connected to 7.
    - Triangle: <0, 9, 7>

4. Edge (1, 0): Already counted in 1.

5. Edge (1, 7): 
    - Both 1 and 7 are connected to 9.
    - Triangle: <1, 7, 9>

6. Edge (2, 4): No triangle formed.

7. Edge (3, 9): No triangle formed.

8. Edge (4, 2): No triangle formed.

9. Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.

10. Edge (4, 7):
    - Both 4 and 7 are connected to 0.
    - Triangle: <4, 7, 0>

11. Edge (4, 8):
    - Both 4 and 8 are connected to 5.
    - Triangle: <4, 8, 5>

12. Edge (5, 4): Already counted in 9.

13. Edge (5, 8): 
    - Both 5 and 8 are connected to 4.
    - Triangle: <5, 8, 4>

14. Edge (5, 9): 
    - Both 5 and 9 are connected to 0.
    - Triangle: <5, 9, 0>

15. Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.

16. Edge (7, 0): Already counted in 2.

17. Edge (7, 1): Already counted in 5.

18. Edge (7, 4): Already counted in 10.

19. Edge (7, 9): 
    - Both 7 and 9 are connected to 0.
    - Triangle: <7, 9, 0>

20. Edge (8, 4): Already counted in 11.

21. Edge (8, 5): Already counted in 13.

22. Edge (9, 0): Already counted in 3.

23. Edge (9, 3): No triangle formed.

24. Edge (9, 5): Already counted in 14.

25. Edge (9, 6): No triangle formed.

26. Edge (9, 7): Already counted in 19.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 8, 5>
