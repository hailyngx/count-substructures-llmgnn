Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
5 (degree 3)
6 (degree 2)
7 (degree 2)
4 (degree 5)
8 (degree 5)
2 (degree 8)

Starting with the least connected vertices and following the process described, the triangles found are:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <0, 5, 2>
5. <1, 0, 4>
6. <1, 2, 3>
7. <1, 2, 4>
8. <1, 3, 2>
9. <1, 3, 8>
10. <3, 2, 4>
11. <3, 6, 5>
12. <4, 2, 8>
13. <4, 5, 2>
14. <4, 7, 2>
15. <4, 7, 8>
16. <4, 8, 2>
17. <5, 2, 8>
18. <5, 6, 3>
19. <7, 2, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [19].
