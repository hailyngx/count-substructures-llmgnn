Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. The sorted list of vertices with their degrees is as follows:

Vertex 2: degree 1
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 1
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 5
Vertex 0: degree 5
Vertex 7: degree 6

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. (0, 1) - Shared connections with vertex 9
2. (0, 3) - No triangles
3. (0, 7) - Shared connections with vertices 4 and 9
4. (0, 9) - No triangles
5. (1, 0) - Shared connections with vertex 9
6. (1, 8) - Shared connections with vertex 4
7. (1, 9) - Shared connections with vertex 0
8. (2, 6) - No triangles
9. (3, 0) - No triangles
10. (4, 5) - Shared connections with vertex 7
11. (4, 7) - Shared connections with vertices 0, 5, and 9
12. (4, 8) - Shared connections with vertices 1 and 7
13. (5, 4) - Shared connections with vertex 7
14. (5, 7) - Shared connections with vertices 4 and 9
15. (6, 2) - No triangles
16. (6, 7) - Shared connections with vertex 4
17. (7, 0) - Shared connections with vertices 4 and 9
18. (7, 4) - Shared connections with vertices 0, 5, and 9
19. (7, 5) - Shared connections with vertex 4
20. (7, 6) - Shared connections with vertex 4
21. (7, 9) - Shared connections with vertices 0, 4, and 5
22. (8, 1) - Shared connections with vertex 4
23. (8, 4) - Shared connections with vertices 1 and 7
24. (9, 0) - Shared connections with vertex 1
25. (9, 1) - Shared connections with vertex 0
26. (9, 7) - Shared connections with vertices 0, 4, and 5

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 4>.
