Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

6: (0, 1, 3, 5, 8)
2: (0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9)
4: (2, 7, 8)
7: (2, 4, 8, 9)
0: (2, 6, 8)
9: (2, 3, 6, 7)

Now, we will count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections between vertices connected by an edge:

Triangles: 
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
