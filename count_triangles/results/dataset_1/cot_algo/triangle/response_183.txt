Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. 

The sorted vertices are: 8, 5, 6, 9, 4, 0, 7, 2, 1, 3.

Now, we count the triangles by following the method described earlier:

- For the edge (1, 5): vertices 1 and 5 share a connection with vertex 8, forming a triangle <1, 5, 8>.
- For the edge (1, 7): vertices 1 and 7 share a connection with vertex 2, forming a triangle <1, 7, 2>.
- For the edge (2, 0): vertex 2 shares connections with vertices 1 and 7, forming a triangle <2, 0, 1>.
- For the edge (2, 7): vertices 2 and 7 share a connection with vertex 1, forming a triangle <2, 7, 1>.
- For the edge (9, 4): vertices 9 and 4 share a connection with vertices 3 and 0, forming two triangles <9, 4, 3> and <9, 4, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [5].
