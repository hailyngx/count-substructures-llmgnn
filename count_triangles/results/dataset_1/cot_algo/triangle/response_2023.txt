Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices in this graph is as follows:
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 1
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 4

By following the degree-based ordering and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles and identify them:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <1, 2, 7>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <2, 5, 7>
7. <2, 7, 9>
8. <3, 4, 7>
9. <6, 7, 9>
10. <6, 8, 9>
11. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in this graph which are represented inside <> brackets. 
The total number of triangles is [11].
