Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
By using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph, we first sort the vertices based on the number of connections:

Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections

Based on the degrees, we can proceed to count triangles:
1. (0, 3): Shares a connection with 5 forming <0, 3, 5>.
2. (0, 5): Shares a connection with 4 forming <0, 4, 5>.
3. (1, 3): No triangle is formed.
4. (1, 7): No triangle is formed.
5. (2, 4): No triangle is formed.
6. (3, 0): No triangle is formed.
7. (3, 1): No triangle is formed.
8. (3, 6): Shares a connection with 0 forming <0, 3, 6>.
9. (3, 8): Shares connections with 7 and 9 forming <3, 7, 8> and <3, 8, 9>.
10. (3, 9): Shares connections with 0, 4, and 8 forming <0, 3, 9> and <3, 4, 9> and <3, 8, 9>.
11. (4, 2): No triangle is formed.
12. (4, 5): Shares a connection with 7 forming <4, 5, 7>.
13. (4, 7): Shares a connection with 5 forming <4, 5, 7>.
14. (4, 9): Shares connections with 0 and 3 forming <0, 4, 9> and <3, 4, 9>.
15. (5, 0): No triangle is formed.
16. (5, 4): Shares a connection with 7 forming <4, 5, 7>.
17. (5, 7): Shares a connection with 4 forming <4, 5, 7>.
18. (6, 3): Shares a connection with 0 forming <0, 3, 6>.
19. (6, 8): No triangle is formed.
20. (7, 1): No triangle is formed.
21. (7, 4): Shares a connection with 5 forming <4, 5, 7>.
22. (7, 5): Shares a connection with 4 forming <4, 5, 7>.
23. (7, 8): Shares connections with 3 and 9 forming <3, 7, 8> and <7, 8, 9>.
24. (7, 9): Shares connections with 3 and 4 forming <3, 7, 9> and <4, 7, 9>.
25. (8, 3): Shares connections with 7 and 9 forming <3, 7, 8> and <3, 8, 9>.
26. (8, 6): No triangle is formed.
27. (8, 7): Shares connections with 3 and 9 forming <3, 7, 8> and <7, 8, 9>.
28. (9, 3): Shares connections with 0, 4, and 8 forming <0, 3, 9> and <3, 4, 9> and <3, 8, 9>.
29. (9, 4): Shares connections with 0 and 7 forming <0, 4, 9> and <4, 7, 9>.
30. (9, 7): Shares connections with 3 and 4 forming <3, 7, 9> and <4, 7, 9>.

There are 21 triangles in total, which can be seen inside brackets: [21].
