Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 5, 8, 3, 0, 6, 4, 1, 9, 7, 2.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles, we analyze the edges in the following order:
(5, 9) - No triangles.
(8, 7) - No triangles.
(3, 9) - No triangles.
(0, 1) - Triangle <0, 1, 2>.
(6, 9) - No triangles.
(4, 6) - Triangle <4, 6, 9>.
(1, 4) - No triangles.
(9, 5) - No triangles.

Count of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <4, 6, 9>.
