Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their degree: 
Node 7 (degree 0)
Nodes 1 and 9 (degree 1)
Nodes 4, 6, 7 (degree 2)
Nodes 0, 3 (degree 4)
Nodes 2, 5, 8 (degree 6)

Triangles found: [<0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 8>]
