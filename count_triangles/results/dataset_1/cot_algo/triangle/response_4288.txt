Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. 
First, let's list the number of connections each node has:

- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections

Now, we'll relabel the nodes based on their number of connections, from smallest to largest:

- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections

Next, we'll analyze the edges starting from the edges involving nodes with the smallest labels and fewer connections.

Calculating the triangles:
- Node 7 and Node 6 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 0 and Node 1 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 4 and Node 2 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 9 and Node 2 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 3 and Node 0 form a triangle with Node 5: <3, 0, 5>.
- Node 3 and Node 0 form a triangle with Node 8: <3, 0, 8>.
- Node 6 and Node 0 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Node 8 and Node 2 form a triangle with Node 5: <8, 2, 5>.
