Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we obtain the following relabeling:  
Node 7 has 0 connections  
Nodes 1 and 4 have 1 connection  
Nodes 0, 3, and 9 have 2 connections  
Nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8 have 4 connections  

Now, we will go through each edge in order of the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections.  
Edge (0, 2): Forms triangles with nodes 5 and 6 <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>  
Edge (0, 5): Forms a triangle with node 2 <0, 5, 2>   
Edge (2, 1): No triangle formed as the condition is not met  
Edge (2, 5): Forms a triangle with node 6 <2, 5, 6>  
Edge (2, 6): Forms a triangle with node 5 <2, 6, 5>  
Edge (5, 0): No triangle formed as the condition is not met  
Edge (5, 2): No triangle formed as the condition is not met  
Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed as the condition is not met  
Edge (6, 2): No triangle formed as the condition is not met  
Edge (6, 5): No triangle formed as the condition is not met  
Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed as the condition is not met  
Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed as the condition is not met  
Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed as the condition is not met  
Edge (8, 7): No triangle formed as the condition is not met  
Edge (9, 6): No triangle formed as the condition is not met

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3]  
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <2, 5, 6>.
