Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph.

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 2>
<7, 9, 5>
