Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0 has 2 connections  
Node 1 has 4 connections  
Node 2 has 3 connections  
Node 3 has 3 connections  
Node 4 has 3 connections  
Node 5 has 5 connections  
Node 6 has 3 connections  
Node 7 has 3 connections  
Node 8 has 2 connections  
Node 9 has 3 connections  

The sorted vertices are: 0, 8, 2, 3, 4, 7, 6, 9, 1, 5.

Now, let's count the triangles:  
Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>  
Triangle 2: <0, 6, 9>  
Triangle 3: <1, 5, 8>  
Triangle 4: <2, 3, 7>  
Triangle 5: <2, 5, 4>  

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
