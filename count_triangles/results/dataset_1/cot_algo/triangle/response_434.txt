Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 4: 0 connections
- Nodes 1 and 4: 1 connection each
- Nodes 2 and 5: 2 connections each
- Nodes 3 and 9: 3 connections each
- Nodes 0 and 6: 4 connections each
- Nodes 7 and 8: 5 connections each

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 4: 0 --> A
- Nodes 1 and 4: 1 --> B and C
- Nodes 2 and 5: 2 --> D and E
- Nodes 3 and 9: 3 --> F and G
- Nodes 0 and 6: 4 --> H and I
- Nodes 7 and 8: 5 --> J and K

3. Process the edges:
- B-D
- B-E
- B-H
- C-E
- D-F
- D-G
- D-K
- E-B
- E-C
- E-H
- F-D
- F-I
- F-K
- F-G
- G-D
- G-I
- G-K
- H-B
- H-D
- H-E
- H-I
- I-F
- I-G
- I-K
- J-F
- J-G
- J-K
- K-D
- K-H
- K-I

4. Count the triangles:
- Total number of triangles: [7]

The unique triangles found are:
- <B, D, K>
- <D, F, G>
- <D, F, K>
- <D, G, K>
- <D, I, K>
- <F, G, K>
- <F, I, K>
