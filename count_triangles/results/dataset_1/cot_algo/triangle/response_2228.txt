Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by the number of connections they have. The sorted list of vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 3 < 6 < 8 < 6 < 8 < 1 < 7 < 4 < 9 < 0
Now, we will count the number of triangles based on this order:

1. Edge (3, 5):
    - Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 5 and 9.
    - Vertex 5 has connections with vertices 0, 3, 4, and 6.
    - Shared connection between vertices 3 and 5 gives the triangle (3, 5, 0).

2. Edge (6, 1):
    - Vertex 6 has connections with vertices 1 and 7.
    - Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 0, 2, and 6.
    - Shared connection between vertices 6 and 1 gives the triangle (6, 1, 0).

3. Edge (8, 7):
    - Vertex 8 has connections with vertices 4 and 7.
    - Vertex 7 has connections with vertices 0, 2, and 8.
    - Shared connection between vertices 8 and 7 gives the triangle (8, 7, 0).

4. Edge (6, 1):
    - Vertex 6 has connections with vertices 1 and 7.
    - Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 0, 2, and 6.
    - Shared connection between vertices 6 and 1 gives the triangle (6, 1, 0).

5. Edge (8, 7):
    - Vertex 8 has connections with vertices 4 and 7.
    - Vertex 7 has connections with vertices 0, 2, and 8.
    - Shared connection between vertices 8 and 7 gives the triangle (8, 7, 0).

6. Edge (8, 4):
    - Vertex 8 has connections with vertices 4 and 7.
    - Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 2, 5, and 8.
    - Shared connection between vertices 8 and 4 gives the triangle (8, 4, 7).

The total number of triangles is [5].
The unique triangles found are <3, 5, 0>, <6, 1, 0>, <8, 7, 0>, and <8, 4, 7>.
