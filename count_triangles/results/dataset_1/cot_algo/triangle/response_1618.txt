Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in increasing order, we can relabel them as follows:
Nodes: 1, 3, 7, 9, 0, 4, 6, 5, 8

The edges that can form triangles based on the degree-based ordering are: (0, 4), (0, 9), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 9), and (8, 9).

By checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 9, 3>, <8, 1, 6>, <8, 1, 7>, <8, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
