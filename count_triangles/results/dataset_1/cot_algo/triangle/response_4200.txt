Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices will be:
- 0 (Degree: 1)
- 5 (Degree: 1)
- 4 (Degree: 1)
- 7 (Degree: 1)
- 6 (Degree: 3)
- 1 (Degree: 4)
- 9 (Degree: 4)
- 8 (Degree: 4)
- 2 (Degree: 4)
- 3 (Degree: 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles in the graph:
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <8, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
