Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of connections each vertex has:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection

Next, we'll sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 7, 8 (1 connection)
- Vertex 0, 1, 6 (2 connections)
- Vertex 2 (3 connections)
- Vertex 3, 5 (4 connections)

Now, we will evaluate each edge based on the degree-based ordering method:
- (0, 5): Both have 2 connections, ignore.
- (0, 6): Both have 2 connections, ignore.
- (1, 2): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, so proceed.
  Check shared connections with 2: Triangle found: <1, 2, 3>.
- (1, 3): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, so proceed.
  Check shared connections with 3: No triangles found.
- (2, 1): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, so proceed.
  Check shared connections with 2: Triangle found: <1, 2, 3>.
- (2, 3): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, so proceed.
  Check shared connections with 3: Triangle found: <1, 2, 3>.
- (2, 5): Both have 3 connections, ignore.
- (3, 1): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, so proceed.
  Check shared connections with 3: No triangles found.
- (3, 2): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, so proceed.
  Check shared connections with 2: Triangle found: <1, 2, 3>.
- (3, 5): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, so proceed.
  Check shared connections with 3: Triangle found: <1, 2, 3>.
- (3, 8): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, so proceed.
  Check shared connections with 8: No triangles found.
- (5, 0): Both have 3 connections, ignore.
- (5, 2): Both have 3 connections, ignore.
- (5, 3): Both have 3 connections, ignore.
- (6, 0): Vertex 6 has 2 connections, so proceed.
  Check shared connections with 0: No triangles found.
- (6, 7): Vertex 6 has 2 connections, so proceed.
  Check shared connections with 7: No triangles found.
- (7, 6): Vertex 6 has 2 connections, so proceed.
  Check shared connections with 6: No triangles found.
- (8, 3): Vertex 8 has 1 connection, proceed. 
  Check shared connections with 3: No triangles found.

Count of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 3>.
