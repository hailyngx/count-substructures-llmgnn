Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then relabel the vertices accordingly.

The degree of each vertex is as follows:
Vertex 0: degree 6
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 1

Based on the degrees, the vertices should be relabeled as follows:
Vertex 9 → 0
Vertex 1 → 1
Vertex 3 → 2
Vertex 4 → 3
Vertex 6 → 4
Vertex 7 → 5
Vertex 8 → 6
Vertex 5 → 7
Vertex 0 → 8

Now, we will examine each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections to count triangles by identifying shared connections:

Triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 1, 5>
<6, 7, 8>

Count of triangles: [7]
