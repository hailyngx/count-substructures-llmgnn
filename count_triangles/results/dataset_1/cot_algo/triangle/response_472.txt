Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Reorder the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes: 4, 1, 6, 5, 0, 7, 9, 8, 3, 2

Now, let's iterate through the edges starting with the lowest-degree nodes:

(0, 4): 
- Node 0 does not have a degree lower than 1, so we skip this edge.

(1, 3): 
- Node 1 has a lower degree than Node 3 and they share Node 2 as a common neighbor. 
  Triangle: <1, 3, 2>

(2, 3): 
- Node 2 has a lower degree than Node 3 and they share Nodes 1 and 7 as common neighbors.
  Triangles: <2, 3, 1>, <2, 3, 7>

(2, 6): 
- Node 2 has a lower degree than Node 6, but there are no common neighbors, so we skip this edge.

(2, 7): 
- Node 2 has a lower degree than Node 7 and they share Node 3 as a common neighbor.
  Triangle: <2, 7, 3>

(2, 8): 
- Node 2 has a lower degree than Node 8 and they share Node 4 as a common neighbor.
  Triangle: <2, 8, 4>

(2, 9): 
- Node 2 has a lower degree than Node 9 and they share Node 5 as a common neighbor.
  Triangle: <2, 9, 5>

(3, 1): 
- Node 3 does not have a degree lower than 1, so we skip this edge.

(3, 2): 
- Node 3 does not have a degree lower than 2, so we skip this edge.

(3, 5): 
- Node 3 has a lower degree than Node 5 and they share Node 9 as a common neighbor.
  Triangle: <3, 5, 9>

(3, 7): 
- Node 3 has a lower degree than Node 7 and they share Node 2 as a common neighbor.
  Triangle: <3, 7, 2>

(4, 0): 
- Node 4 does not have a degree lower than 0, so we skip this edge.

(4, 8): 
- Node 4 does not have a degree lower than 8, so we skip this edge.

(5, 3): 
- Node 5 does not have a degree lower than 3, so we skip this edge.

(5, 9): 
- Node 5 does not have a degree lower than 9, so we skip this edge.

(6, 2): 
- Node 6 does not have a degree lower than 2, so we skip this edge.

(7, 2): 
- Node 7 does not have a degree lower than 2, so we skip this edge.

(7, 3): 
- Node 7 does not have a degree lower than 3, so we skip this edge.

(8, 2): 
- Node 8 does not have a degree lower than 2, so we skip this edge.

(8, 4): 
- Node 8 does not have a degree lower than 4, so we skip this edge.

(9, 2): 
- Node 9 does not have a degree lower than 2, so we skip this edge.

(9, 5): 
- Node 9 does not have a degree lower than 5, so we skip this edge.
