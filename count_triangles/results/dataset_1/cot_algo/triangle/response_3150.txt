Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). 

The degrees of the vertices are:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 6
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 5
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 2

Now, relabeling the vertices in increasing order of degree:
- Vertex 2 and 9 (degree 2) become Vertex 0 and 1
- Vertex 0, 3, and 8 (degree 3) become Vertex 2, 3, and 4
- Vertex 5, 6, and 7 (degree 4) become Vertex 5, 6, and 7
- Vertex 4 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 1 (degree 6) becomes Vertex 9

The edges in the new ordering are:
(0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (7, 8)

Now, counting the triangles by considering the edges:

- Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle <1, 6, 4>
- Triangle <1, 7, 4>
- Triangle <1, 5, 4>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
