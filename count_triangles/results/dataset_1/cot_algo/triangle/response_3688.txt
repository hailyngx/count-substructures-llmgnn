Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following relabeling:
- Node 3 with 2 connections
- Nodes 2 and 5 with 1 connection each
- Nodes 1, 8, and 4 with 5 connections each
- Nodes 0, 6, and 9 with 6 connections each
- Node 7 with 7 connections

Considering the edges and the relabeling above, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. The triangles found in this graph are:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <0, 8, 4>
5. <1, 4, 5>
6. <2, 6, 9>
7. <7, 3, 0>
8. <7, 5, 1>
9. <7, 9, 0>
10. <9, 6, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [10].
