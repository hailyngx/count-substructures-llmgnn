Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labeling is as follows:
Vertices: 1, 8, 0, 2, 6, 7, 5, 4, 9, 3

Now, we will count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method. 

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <2, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
