Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 5 (0 connections)
Nodes 1 and 2 (1 connection)
Nodes 8 and 9 (2 connections)
Nodes 3, 7, and 10 (4 connections)
Nodes 4 and 6 (6 connections)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

1. (0, 4): No triangles found.
2. (0, 6): No triangles found.
3. (1, 2): No triangles found.
4. (1, 3): Triangle found: <1, 3, 2>.
5. (2, 1): No triangles found.
6. (2, 6): No triangles found.
7. (3, 1): No triangles found.
8. (3, 4): Triangle found: <3, 4, 0>.
9. (3, 6): Triangle found: <3, 6, 0>.
10. (3, 7): No triangles found.
11. (3, 8): No triangles found.
12. (4, 0): No triangles found.
13. (4, 3): No triangles found.
14. (4, 8): No triangles found.
15. (6, 0): No triangles found.
16. (6, 2): No triangles found.
17. (6, 3): Triangle found: <6, 3, 0>.
18. (6, 7): No triangles found.
19. (6, 8): No triangles found.
20. (6, 9): No triangles found.
21. (7, 3): No triangles found.
22. (7, 6): No triangles found.
23. (7, 8): No triangles found.
24. (7, 9): No triangles found.
25. (8, 3): No triangles found.
26. (8, 4): No triangles found.
27. (8, 6): No triangles found.
28. (8, 7): No triangles found.
29. (9, 6): No triangles found.
30. (9, 7): No triangles found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 2>, <3, 4, 0>, and <6, 3, 0>.
