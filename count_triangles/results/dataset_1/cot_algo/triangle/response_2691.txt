Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 3 < Node 5 < Node 2 < Node 6 < Node 8 < Node 9 < Node 0 < Node 4 < Node 1 < Node 7.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the given graph are:
[9]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 8>
