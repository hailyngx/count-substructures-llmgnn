Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the number of triangles:

Checking edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 3):
   - Node 0 and Node 3 share a connection with Node 5, forming a triangle <0, 3, 5>.

2. Edge (1, 2):
   - Node 1 and Node 2 do not form a triangle as they do not have a shared connection.

3. Edge (6, 9):
   - Node 6 and Node 9 share a connection with Node 4, forming a triangle <6, 9, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2]. The triangles found are <0, 3, 5> and <6, 9, 4>.
