Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree (number of connections).

1. Vertices by degree: 
   - Vertex 3: 0 connections
   - Vertices 7 and 8: 1 connection each
   - Vertices 2, 5, 6: 2 connections each
   - Vertices 0 and 3: 3 connections each
   - Vertex 1: 4 connections
   - Vertex 9: 5 connections
   - Vertex 4: 6 connections

2. Renumber the vertices based on their degree:
   - Vertex 3 (0 connections) -> Vertex A
   - Vertices 7 and 8 (1 connection each) -> Vertices B and C
   - Vertices 2 and 5 (2 connections each) -> Vertices D and E
   - Vertices 6, 0, and 3 (3 connections each) -> Vertices F, G, and H
   - Vertex 1 (4 connections) -> Vertex I
   - Vertex 9 (5 connections) -> Vertex J
   - Vertex 4 (6 connections) -> Vertex K

3. Checking edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
   - (A, B): No triangle
   - (A, G): No triangle
   - (A, D): No triangle
   - (B, A): No triangle
   - (B, K): No triangle
   - (B, G): No triangle
   - (B, F): No triangle
   - (C, J): No triangle
   - (D, K): No triangle
   - (E, I): No triangle
   - (F, J): No triangle
   - (G, A): No triangle
   - (H, G): No triangle
   - (I, B): Triangle <1, 0, 4>
   - (I, K): No triangle
   - (I, J): No triangle
   - (J, I): No triangle
   - (J, F): No triangle
   - (J, C): No triangle
   - (J, K): No triangle

4. Total number of triangles: [1]
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1], specifically the triangle <1, 0, 4>.
