Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted order of vertices based on their degrees is as follows: 

Vertices: 5, 6, 7, 9, 1, 2, 8, 3, 0, 4

After relabeling the vertices accordingly, the updated edges are as follows:
(5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 1) (9, 0) (1, 3) (2, 7) (8, 1) (3, 1) (0, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (3, 4) (0, 5) (9, 2) (4, 3) (0, 6) (8, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (4, 7) (9, 6) (4, 8) (1, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (3, 8) (5, 4) (4, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (4, 9)

Now, we will count the number of triangles formed by the edges based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 3]
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
