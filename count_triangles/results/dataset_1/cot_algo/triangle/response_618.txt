Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:
- Vertex 2: 0 connections
- Vertex 0, 4, 7, 9: 1 connection
- Vertex 3, 5, 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 1, 6: 4 connections

After relabeling the vertices accordingly, we will list the edges while following the condition that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Vertices: 2, 0, 4, 7, 9, 3, 5, 8, 1, 6

Edges to consider:
(2, x), (2, x), (2, x), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, x), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, x), (6, x), (7, 1), (8, x), (9, 8)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by the shared connections:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle 2: <1, 4, 5>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
