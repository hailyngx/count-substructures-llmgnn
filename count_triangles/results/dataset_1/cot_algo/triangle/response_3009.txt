Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes by their degree:
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 0
- Nodes 8 and 10 have degree 1
- Nodes 2, 7, and 9 have degree 4
- Nodes 5 and 6 have degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 4

Next, we will re-label the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connections:
- Node 4 (0 connections) will be labeled as 1
- Nodes 1, 8, and 10 (1 connection) will be labeled as 2
- Nodes 5 and 6 (3 connections) will be labeled as 3
- Nodes 2, 7, and 9 (4 connections) will be labeled as 4
- Node 3 (4 connections) will be labeled as 5

Now, we will check for triangles considering the lower labeled node when there is an edge between two nodes:
- <2, 4, 9>
- <3, 2, 7>
- <3, 2, 9>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <5, 3, 6>
- <5, 3, 9>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <6, 3, 2>
- <6, 5, 9>

Finally, counting the total number of unique triangles found: [8]
