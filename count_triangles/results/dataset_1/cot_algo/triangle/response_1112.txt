Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections

Next, we will iterate through the edges considering the vertices following the Degree-Based Ordering method. We will only count triangles when the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

- (0, 2): Both have 1 connection, so skip.
- (1, 4): Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 4. Both are connected to Node 6, so there is a triangle <1, 4, 6>.
- (1, 6): Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 6. Both are connected to Node 8, so there is a triangle <1, 6, 8>.
- (1, 8): Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 8. Both are connected to Node 6, so there is a triangle <1, 8, 6>.
- (2, 0): Same as (0, 2), skip.
- (2, 3): Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 2. Nodes 2 and 3 are connected to each other, so there is a triangle <2, 3, 6>.
- (2, 4): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 4. Both are connected to Node 6, so there is a triangle <2, 4, 6>.
- (2, 9): Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 9. No triangles found.
- (3, 2): Same as (2, 3), skip.
- (3, 6): Both connected to Node 2, so skip.
- (4, 1): Same as (1, 4), skip.
- (4, 2): Same as (2, 4), skip.
- (5, 6): Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 6. Nodes 5 and 6 are connected to each other, so there is a triangle <5, 6, 1>.
- (5, 7): Both connected to Node 6, so skip.
- (6, 1): Same as (1, 6), skip.
- (6, 3): Same as (3, 6), skip.
- (6, 5): Same as (5, 6), skip.
- (6, 8): Node 8 has fewer connections than Node 6. Nodes 6 and 8 are connected to each other, so there is a triangle <6, 8, 1>.
- (7, 5): Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 5. No triangles found.
- (8, 1): Same as (1, 8), skip.
- (8, 6): Same as (6, 8), skip.
- (9, 2): No triangles found.

After considering all edges, we found the following unique triangles: <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <5, 6, 1>, <6, 8, 1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
