Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling of the nodes will be:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 9: 7 connections
Node 1: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles by examining each edge in the graph:

1. (0, 5): No triangle formed.
2. (1, 2): Triangle formed with node 4 <1, 2, 4>.
3. (1, 3): No triangle formed.
4. (1, 4): Triangle formed with nodes 7 and 9 <1, 4, 7> and <1, 4, 9>.
5. (1, 6): Triangle formed with node 2 <1, 6, 2>.
6. (1, 7): No triangle formed.
7. (1, 9): No triangle formed.
8. (2, 4): Triangle formed with nodes 6 and 9 <2, 4, 6> and <2, 4, 9>.
9. (5, 0): No triangle formed.
10. (5, 4): Triangle formed with nodes 6 and 9 <5, 4, 6> and <5, 4, 9>.
11. (5, 6): Triangle formed with node 9 <5, 6, 9>.
12. (5, 9): No triangle formed.
13. (6, 2): Triangle formed with node 4 <6, 2, 4>.
14. (6, 9): Triangle formed with node 2 <6, 9, 2>.
15. (9, 7): Triangle formed with node 1 <9, 7, 1>.
16. (9, 2): Triangle formed with node 4 <9, 2, 4>.

Counting the total number of triangles, we find: [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 2>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<5, 4, 6>
<5, 4, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 9, 2>
<9, 7, 1>
<9, 2, 4>
