Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, we get the following labels for the nodes: 

Node 7 - 1 connection 
Node 1 - 2 connections 
Node 2 - 2 connections 
Node 8 - 3 connections 
Node 4 - 3 connections 
Node 0 - 3 connections 
Node 5 - 3 connections 
Node 3 - 3 connections 
Node 6 - 4 connections 
Node 9 - 4 connections 

Now we will check for triangles based on the degree-based ordering method. We start with edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Examining the edges, we find the following triangles: 
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
