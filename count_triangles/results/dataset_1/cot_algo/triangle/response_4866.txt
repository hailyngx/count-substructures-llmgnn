Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices by connections:
- Node 4: 0 connections
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections

We will relabel the nodes accordingly and restate the edges in terms of the labels:

The updated edge list based on labels:
- (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges:
Number of triangles: 1

Unique triangles:
<5, 8, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
