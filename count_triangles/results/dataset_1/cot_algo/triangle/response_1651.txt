Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted order of vertices with the number of connections in parentheses is as follows: <2(2), 4(1), 5(1), 0(3), 1(3), 9(3), 7(2), 6(4), 8(3), 3(5)>. 

Now, let's proceed with counting the triangles:

For edge (0, 3):
Vertex 0 has 3 connections and vertex 3 has 5 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 0 (3, 4, 8) and vertex 3 (1, 0, 5, 6). 
There is one triangle: <0, 3, 6>.

For edge (0, 4):
Vertex 0 has 3 connections and vertex 4 has 1 connection. So, we do not proceed with this edge.

For edge (0, 8):
Vertex 0 has 3 connections and vertex 8 has 3 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 0 (3, 4, 8) and vertex 8 (6, 0, 9).
There is one triangle: <0, 8, 6>.

For edge (1, 3):
Vertex 1 has 3 connections and vertex 3 has 5 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 1 (3, 7, 9) and vertex 3 (1, 0, 5, 6). 
There is one triangle: <1, 3, 6>.

For edge (1, 7):
Vertex 1 has 3 connections and vertex 7 has 2 connections. So, we do not proceed with this edge.

For edge (1, 9):
Vertex 1 has 3 connections and vertex 9 has 3 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 1 (3, 7, 9) and vertex 9 (1, 6, 8).
There is one triangle: <1, 9, 6>.

For edge (2, 6):
Vertex 2 has 2 connections and vertex 6 has 4 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 2 (7, 3) and vertex 6 (2, 3, 8, 9).
There is one triangle: <2, 6, 3>.

For edge (2, 7):
Vertex 2 has 2 connections and vertex 7 has 2 connections. So, we do not proceed with this edge.

For edge (3, 6):
Vertex 3 has 5 connections and vertex 6 has 4 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 3 (0, 1, 5, 6) and vertex 6 (2, 3, 8, 9).
There is one triangle: <3, 6, 2>.

For edge (3, 1):
Vertex 3 has 5 connections and vertex 1 has 3 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 3 (0, 1, 5, 6) and vertex 1 (3, 7, 9).
There is one triangle: <3, 1, 6>.

For edge (3, 5):
Vertex 3 has 5 connections and vertex 5 has 1 connection. So, we do not proceed with this edge.

Vertex 4 has 1 connection and vertex 0 has 3 connections. So, we do not proceed with this edge.

For edge (5, 3):
Vertex 5 has 1 connection and vertex 3 has 5 connections. So, we do not proceed with this edge.

For edge (6, 2):
Vertex 6 has 4 connections and vertex 2 has 2 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 6 (2, 3, 8, 9) and vertex 2 (7, 3).
There is one triangle: <6, 2, 3>.

For edge (6, 3):
Vertex 6 has 4 connections and vertex 3 has 5 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 6 (2, 3, 8, 9) and vertex 3 (0, 1, 5, 6).
There is one triangle: <6, 3, 0>.

For edge (6, 8):
Vertex 6 has 4 connections and vertex 8 has 3 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 6 (2, 3, 8, 9) and vertex 8 (6, 0, 9).
There is one triangle: <6, 8, 0>.

For edge (6, 9):
Vertex 6 has 4 connections and vertex 9 has 3 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 6 (2, 3, 8, 9) and vertex 9 (1, 6, 8).
There is one triangle: <6, 9, 1>.

For edge (7, 1):
Vertex 7 has 2 connections and vertex 1 has 3 connections. So, we do not proceed with this edge.

For edge (7, 2):
Vertex 7 has 2 connections and vertex 2 has 2 connections. So, we do not proceed with this edge.

For edge (8, 0):
Vertex 8 has 3 connections and vertex 0 has 3 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 8 (6, 0, 9) and vertex 0 (3, 4, 8).
There is one triangle: <8, 0, 6>.

For edge (8, 6):
Vertex 8 has 3 connections and vertex 6 has 4 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 8 (6, 0, 9) and vertex 6 (2, 3, 8, 9).
There is one triangle: <8, 6, 2>.

For edge (8, 9):
Vertex 8 has 3 connections and vertex 9 has 3 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 8 (6, 0, 9) and vertex 9 (1, 6, 8).
There is one triangle: <8, 9, 1>.

For edge (9, 1):
Vertex 9 has 3 connections and vertex 1 has 3 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 9 (1, 6, 8) and vertex 1 (3, 7, 9).
There is one triangle: <9, 1, 6>.

For edge (9, 6):
Vertex 9 has 3 connections and vertex 6 has 4 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 9 (1, 6, 8) and vertex 6 (2, 3, 8, 9).
There is one triangle: <9, 6, 2>.

For edge (9, 8):
Vertex 9 has 3 connections and vertex 8 has 3 connections. So, we check shared connections of vertex 9 (1, 6, 8) and vertex 8 (6, 0, 9).
There is one triangle: <9, 8, 6>.

Finally, the total number of triangles is [9] with unique triangles being <0, 3, 6>, <0, 8, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 9, 6>, <2, 6, 3>, <6, 2, 3>, <6, 3, 0>, <6, 8, 0>, <8, 6, 2>, <8, 9, 1>, <9, 1, 6>, <9, 6, 2>, <9, 8, 6>.
