Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections they have from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertices: 7, 5, 7, 7, 5, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge and count the number of triangles formed by shared connections. After analyzing all edges, we find that the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<1, 2, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
