Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

- Node 0: 2 edges
- Node 1: 2 edges
- Node 2: 2 edges
- Node 3: 3 edges
- Node 5: 3 edges
- Node 7: 2 edges
- Node 9: 1 edge
- Node 8: 2 edges
- Node 6: 4 edges
- Node 4: 6 edges

Now, the vertices are relabeled accordingly from 0 to 9 based on their degree.

The sorted list of edges is:
(9, 4), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6), (7, 8), (1, 6), (3, 4), (4, 0), (8, 4), (0, 5), (5, 0), (4, 3), (3, 5), (2, 7), (6, 1), (7, 2), (4, 6), (6, 2),  (3, 6), (6, 4), (5, 1), (5, 3), (4, 8), (8, 7), (6, 3), (4, 9).

Using this ordering, we will count the number of triangles:

- Triangle <3, 4, 6>
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <1, 5, 6>
- Triangle <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
