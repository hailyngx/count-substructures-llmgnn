Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their connections from least to most:
(2, 5, 9, 7, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8)

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. 

Considering this, we will analyze the edges (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 8), (6, 7), and (6, 8) to count the number of triangles.

After checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<1, 2, 4>
<3, 7, 6>
<3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
