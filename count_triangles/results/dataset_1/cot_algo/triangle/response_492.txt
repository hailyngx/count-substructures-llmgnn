Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees, from least to most connected. 

The sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
0: 4
1: 3
2: 1
3: 4
4: 2
6: 4
7: 5
8: 4
9: 5

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed.

The total number of triangles is [16].
The unique triangles found are <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
