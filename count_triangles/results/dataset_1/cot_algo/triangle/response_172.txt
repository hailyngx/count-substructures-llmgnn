Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we have the following new labels for the nodes: 

Node 0 has degree 2  
Node 1 has degree 3 
Node 2 has degree 4 
Node 5 has degree 6 
Node 7 has degree 4 
Node 8 has degree 3 
Node 6 has degree 3 
Node 9 has degree 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we consider the edges in the following order: 
(0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), and (7, 9). 

By examining the shared connections, we find the following triangles: 
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<7, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
