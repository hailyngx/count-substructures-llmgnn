Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first sort the vertices by their degrees in ascending order:

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 6

Now, we will go through each edge based on the degree-based ordering and count the number of triangles formed:

(0, 3) - Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 3. Number of shared connections: 1 (Node 3). <0, 3, 2> is a triangle.
(1, 6) - Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 6. Number of shared connections: 0. No triangle.
(1, 8) - Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 8. Number of shared connections: 0. No triangle.
(2, 3) - Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 3. Number of shared connections: 1 (Node 3). <2, 3, 0> is a triangle.
(2, 4) - Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 4. Number of shared connections: 0. No triangle.
(2, 7) - Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 7. Number of shared connections: 1 (Node 7). <2, 7, 3> is a triangle.
(2, 8) - Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 8. Number of shared connections: 1 (Node 8). <2, 8, 1> is a triangle.
(3, 5) - Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 5. Number of shared connections: 1 (Node 5). <3, 5, 0> is a triangle.
(3, 7) - Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 7. Number of shared connections: 1 (Node 7). <3, 7, 2> is a triangle.
(6, 8) - Node 6 has fewer connections than Node 8. Number of shared connections: 1 (Node 8). <6, 8, 1> is a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 2>, <2, 7, 3>, <2, 8, 1>, <3, 5, 0>, <3, 7, 2>, <6, 8, 1>
