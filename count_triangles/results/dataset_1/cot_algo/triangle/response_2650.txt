Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 0 (degree 5) -> New Label 0
Vertex 1 (degree 3) -> New Label 1
Vertex 3 (degree 2) -> New Label 2
Vertex 5 (degree 2) -> New Label 3
Vertex 7 (degree 2) -> New Label 4
Vertex 9 (degree 2) -> New Label 5
Vertex 2 (degree 2) -> New Label 6
Vertex 4 (degree 1) -> New Label 7
Vertex 6 (degree 1) -> New Label 8

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 3> is formed using edges (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 3).
- Triangle <0, 1, 7> is formed using edges (0, 1), (0, 7), (1, 7).
- Triangle <0, 5, 9> is formed using edges (0, 5), (0, 9), (5, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
