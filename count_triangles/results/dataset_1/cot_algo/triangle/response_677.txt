Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 7: 0 connections
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles:
For (0, 2):
- Both vertices have 4 connections.
- They share vertex 9, forming a triangle <0, 2, 9>.

For (0, 6):
- Both vertices have 4 connections.
- They share vertex 9, forming a triangle <0, 6, 9>.

For (0, 9):
- Both vertices have 4 connections.
- They share vertices 2 and 6, forming triangles <0, 2, 9> and <0, 6, 9>.

For (1, 4):
- Both vertices have 4 connections.
- They share vertex 8, forming a triangle <1, 4, 8>.

For (1, 8):
- Vertex 1 has 2 connections and vertex 8 has 3 connections.
- They share vertices 4 and 5, forming a triangle <1, 4, 5> and a triangle <1, 4, 8>.

For (2, 3):
- Vertex 2 has 4 connections and vertex 3 has 1 connection.
- They share no common vertices, no triangles formed.

For (2, 3):
- Vertex 2 has 4 connections and vertex 3 has 1 connection.
- They share no common vertices, no triangles formed.

For the remaining edges, no triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
