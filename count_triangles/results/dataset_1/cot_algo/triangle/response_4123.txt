Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Node 0 has 3 connections  
Node 4 has 3 connections  
Node 6 has 3 connections  
Node 7 has 2 connections  
Node 3 has 4 connections  
Node 8 has 2 connections  
Node 1 has 4 connections  
Node 9 has 2 connections  
Node 2 has 5 connections  
Node 5 has 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the order:  
(7, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5), (9, 1), (9, 5), (4, 3), (6, 0), (6, 4), (7, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 4), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8)  

By checking the shared connections, we can find the triangles:  
<0, 1, 5>  
<2, 3, 5>  
<4, 3, 5>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
