Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by number of connections are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 6, 9, 3, 5, 7, 0.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
