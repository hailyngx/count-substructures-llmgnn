Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees, we have the following mapping:
Node 0 is connected to [3, 4, 9]
Node 1 is connected to [6, 8]
Node 2 is connected to [3, 6]
Node 3 is connected to [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
Node 4 is connected to [0, 3]
Node 5 is connected to [3, 8, 9]
Node 6 is connected to [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9]
Node 7 is connected to [6, 9]
Node 8 is connected to [1, 3, 5, 6]
Node 9 is connected to [0, 3, 5, 6, 7]

Following the degree-based ordering method, we start counting triangles:
- Edge between 0 and 3 forms triangle <0, 3, 4>
- Edge between 0 and 4 forms triangle <0, 3, 4>
- Edge between 0 and 9 forms triangle <0, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
