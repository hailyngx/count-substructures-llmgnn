Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree. The vertices are then relabeled based on this ordering. 

The sorted list of vertices based on the degree is as follows:
Node 3 (degree 2)
Node 6 (degree 2)
Node 7 (degree 2)
Node 9 (degree 2)
Node 4 (degree 4)
Node 2 (degree 4)
Node 5 (degree 4)
Node 8 (degree 5)
Node 0 (degree 5)
Node 1 (degree 6)

Now, we will count the number of triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: [9]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 8, 5>, <2, 8, 5>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 8>
