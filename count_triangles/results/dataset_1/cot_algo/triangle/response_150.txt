Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in efficiently counting the number of triangles in the graph. 

First, let's assign labels to the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
- Vertex 7 has 2 connections
- Vertices 4, 5, 6, and 9 have 3 connections
- Vertices 0, 3, and 8 have 4 connections
- Vertices 1 and 2 have 6 connections

The edges to consider are:
1. (0, 1) - lower label vertex 0
2. (0, 2) - lower label vertex 0
3. (0, 7) - lower label vertex 0
4. (0, 8) - lower label vertex 0
5. (1, 2) - lower label vertex 1
6. (1, 3) - lower label vertex 1
7. (1, 8) - lower label vertex 1
8. (1, 9) - lower label vertex 1
9. (2, 3) - lower label vertex 2
10. (2, 4) - lower label vertex 2
11. (2, 6) - lower label vertex 2
12. (2, 9) - lower label vertex 2

Now, we check for shared connections to find triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 2> (shared connection is 2)
- Triangle <1, 2, 3> (shared connection is 2)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2> and <1, 2, 3>.
