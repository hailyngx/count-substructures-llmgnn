Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes in increasing order of their degrees:

Node 3 (1 connection) -> Node 1
Node 5 (1 connection) -> Node 2
Node 6 (3 connections) -> Node 3
Node 4 (2 connections) -> Node 4
Node 1 (2 connections) -> Node 5
Node 9 (4 connections) -> Node 6
Node 7 (4 connections) -> Node 7
Node 8 (4 connections) -> Node 8

Next, we go through each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Checking (1, 7): Both Node 1 and Node 7 have fewer connections.
Checking (3, 8): Both Node 1 and Node 8 have fewer connections.
Checking (4, 7): Both Node 4 and Node 7 have fewer connections.
Checking (5, 8): Both Node 2 and Node 8 have fewer connections.
Checking (6, 8): Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 8.
Checking (6, 9): Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 9.
Checking (7, 4): Both Node 7 and Node 4 have fewer connections.
Checking (7, 9): Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 9.

Now, we count the triangles:

<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 7, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
