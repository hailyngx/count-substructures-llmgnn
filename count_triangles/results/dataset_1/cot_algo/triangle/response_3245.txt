Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 5 (Degree 0)
- Node 8 (Degree 1)
- Node 0 (Degree 3)
- Node 6 (Degree 3)
- Node 3 (Degree 4)
- Node 1 (Degree 4)
- Node 8 (Degree 6)
- Node 2 (Degree 6)
- Node 9 (Degree 7)
- Node 7 (Degree 7)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
