Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the nodes are: 

Node 0 - degree 3  
Node 2 - degree 1  
Node 8 - degree 1  
Node 4 - degree 2  
Node 5 - degree 2  
Node 6 - degree 2  
Node 7 - degree 4  
Node 1 - degree 5  
Node 3 - degree 5  
Node 9 - degree 6  

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can find the triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [11], and the unique triangles are:  
<1, 3, 9>  
<1, 4, 9>  
<1, 5, 9>  
<1, 6, 9>  
<1, 7, 9>  
<2, 3, 8>  
<2, 5, 9>  
<4, 5, 9>  
<4, 6, 9>  
<5, 6, 9>  
<5, 7, 9>
