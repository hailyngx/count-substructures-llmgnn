Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0: 2 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 2: 5 edges
- Node 3: 6 edges
- Node 4: 5 edges
- Node 5: 4 edges
- Node 6: 5 edges
- Node 7: 3 edges
- Node 8: 4 edges
- Node 9: 5 edges

Sorting the nodes by degree in ascending order:
- Node 0: 2 edges
- Node 7: 3 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 5: 4 edges
- Node 8: 4 edges
- Node 4: 5 edges
- Node 6: 5 edges
- Node 2: 5 edges
- Node 9: 5 edges
- Node 3: 6 edges

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start considering edges involving nodes with lower degree first.

Triangles identified in the graph:
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
