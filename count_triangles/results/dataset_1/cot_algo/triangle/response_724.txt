Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 6
Node 9 has degree 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

For edge (0, 3): Shared connections with node 4 form a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
For edge (1, 8): No triangles are formed.
For edge (1, 9): Shared connections with node 2 form a triangle <1, 9, 2>.
For edge (2, 4): Shared connections with nodes 3 and 9 form triangles <2, 4, 3> and <2, 4, 9>.
For edge (2, 7): No triangles are formed.
For edge (2, 9): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (3, 4): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (4, 2): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (4, 3): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (4, 5): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (4, 9): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (5, 4): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (5, 6): No triangles are formed.
For edge (5, 9): Shared connections with node 4 form a triangle <5, 9, 4>.
For edge (6, 5): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (6, 9): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (7, 2): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (8, 1): No triangles are formed.
For edge (9, 1): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (9, 2): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (9, 4): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (9, 5): No additional triangles are formed.
For edge (9, 6): No additional triangles are formed.

Count of triangles: 4
Triangles found: <0, 3, 4>, <1, 9, 2>, <2, 4, 3>, <5, 9, 4> 

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
