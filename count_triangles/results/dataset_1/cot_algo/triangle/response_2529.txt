Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:
(0: 2), (1: 3), (2: 3), (3: 4), (4: 2), (5: 2), (6: 3), (7: 1), (8: 4), (9: 2)

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:
(0: 1), (4: 2), (5: 3), (9: 4), (7: 5), (1: 6), (2: 7), (6: 8), (3: 9), (8: 10)

Next, we will list the vertices in ascending order of their labels and list the edges accordingly:
(0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 8) (9, 2) 

Now, we will check for triangles:

Triangle 1: <1, 6, 8>
Triangle 2: <3, 4, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
