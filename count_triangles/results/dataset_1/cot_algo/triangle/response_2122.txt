Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
Vertex 0: degree 1
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 6

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 0 (degree 1) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 6 (degree 2) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 9 (degree 2) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 5 (degree 3) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 8 (degree 3) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 7 (degree 3) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 3 (degree 3) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 1 (degree 4) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 4 (degree 4) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 2 (degree 6) -> Vertex 9

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Analyzing the edges:
- Edge (0, 2) skipped, as both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (1, 2) skipped, as vertex 1 has higher degree.
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 5. Triangle: <1, 5, 7>.
- Edge (1, 9) skipped, as vertex 1 has higher degree.
- Edge (2, 5) skipped, as both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (2, 7) skipped, as both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (2, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 9>.
- Edge (3, 4) skipped, as both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (3, 7) skipped, as both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (4, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 8. Triangle: <4, 6, 8>.
- Edge (4, 8) skipped, as vertex 4 has higher degree.
- Edge (5, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 8. Triangle: <5, 6, 8>.

Finally, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, and <4, 6, 8>.
