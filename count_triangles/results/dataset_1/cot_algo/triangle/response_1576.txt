Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 1 (degree 1) - original label: 1
Node 5 (degree 1) - original label: 5
Node 9 (degree 2) - original label: 9
Node 4 (degree 2) - original label: 4
Node 6 (degree 3) - original label: 6
Node 7 (degree 4) - original label: 7
Node 8 (degree 4) - original label: 8
Node 0 (degree 5) - original label: 0
Node 3 (degree 5) - original label: 3
Node 2 (degree 6) - original label: 2

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is: [8]

Unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
