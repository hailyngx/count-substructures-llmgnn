Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 2 (Degree 2)
- Node 7 (Degree 0)
- Node 9 (Degree 1)
- Node 3 (Degree 3)
- Node 5 (Degree 3)
- Node 8 (Degree 3)
- Node 0 (Degree 4)
- Node 1 (Degree 4)
- Node 4 (Degree 4)
- Node 6 (Degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph, the total number of triangles is [12], and the unique triangles found are:
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 3>
- <0, 4, 1>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 6, 5>
- <0, 6, 3>
- <0, 6, 1>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 3>
- <4, 6, 5>
- <6, 5, 3>
