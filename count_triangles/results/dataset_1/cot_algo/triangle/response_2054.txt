Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: degree 2
1: degree 1
2: degree 4
3: degree 1
4: degree 2
5: degree 4
6: degree 1
7: degree 2
8: degree 4
9: degree 3

Now, we start counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Checking edge (0, 5) since 0 < 5 and degree(0) < degree(5):
Shared connections for (0, 5): 1, 4
Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>

Checking edge (0, 6) since 0 < 6 and degree(0) < degree(6):

Checking edge (1, 5) since 1 < 5 and degree(1) < degree(5):

Checking edge (2, 4) since 2 < 4 and degree(2) < degree(4):

Checking edge (2, 8) since 2 < 8 and degree(2) < degree(8):
Shared connections for (2, 8): 4
Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>

Checking edge (2, 9) since 2 < 9 and degree(2) < degree(9):
Shared connections for (2, 9): 8
Triangle formed: <2, 8, 9>

Checking edge (3, 7) since 3 < 7 and degree(3) < degree(7):

Checking edge (4, 2) since 2 < 4 and degree(2) < degree(4):
Shared connections for (4, 2): 8
Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>

Checking edge (4, 5) since 4 < 5 and degree(4) < degree(5):

Checking edge (5, 0) since 0 < 5 and degree(0) < degree(5):

Checking edge (5, 1) since 1 < 5 and degree(1) < degree(5):

Checking edge (5, 4) since 4 < 5 and degree(4) < degree(5):
Shared connections for (5, 4): 0
Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>

Checking edge (6, 0) since 0 < 6 and degree(0) < degree(6):

Checking edge (7, 3) since 3 < 7 and degree(3) < degree(7):

Checking edge (7, 8) since 7 < 8 and degree(7) < degree(8):

Checking edge (8, 2) since 2 < 8 and degree(2) < degree(8):
Shared connections for (8, 2): 4
Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>

Checking edge (8, 7) since 7 < 8 and degree(7) < degree(8):

Checking edge (8, 9) since 8 < 9 and degree(8) < degree(9):

Checking edge (9, 2) since 2 < 9 and degree(2) < degree(9):
Shared connections for (9, 2): 8
No new triangles formed.

Checking edge (9, 8) since 8 < 9 and degree(8) < degree(9):
Shared connections for (9, 8): 2
Triangle formed: <2, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
