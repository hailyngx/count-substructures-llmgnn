Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
After labeling the vertices based on their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 0 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 4 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 9 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 3 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 5 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 2 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 6 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 1 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 8 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 7 (Degree 6)

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will examine the edges in the following order: (0, 3), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 1), (1, 6), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 9), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 5).

There are 3 triangles in the graph, and they are:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <7, 6, 8>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
