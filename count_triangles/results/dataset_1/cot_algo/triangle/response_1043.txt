Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are as follows:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 8: 6 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections

Now, let's count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering:

There are 15 triangles in total.
The unique triangles are:
1. <2, 6, 8>
2. <4, 6, 7>
3. <1, 6, 9>
4. <0, 4, 8>
5. <3, 6, 9>
6. <2, 4, 7>
7. <1, 6, 8>
8. <0, 4, 2>
9. <3, 6, 8>
10. <1, 6, 7>
11. <1, 8, 9>
12. <4, 6, 8>
13. <7, 6, 9>
14. <0, 2, 4>
15. <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [15].
