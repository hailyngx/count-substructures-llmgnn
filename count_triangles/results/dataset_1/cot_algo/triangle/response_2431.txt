Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly, the new order is: 3, 4, 8, 0, 1, 5, 6, 9, 2, 7.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles:

- Triangle <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
