Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the relabeling is as follows: 
Nodes: 4, 5, 8, 0, 2, 9, 1, 3, 6, 7 

Now we will go through each edge to count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 3): Shared connections = [7]. <0, 3, 7>
2. Edge (0, 4): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 7): Shared connections = [2]. <1, 2, 7>
6. Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (3, 7): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (4, 0): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (5, 1): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (6, 2): Shared connections = [7]. <2, 6, 7>
11. Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (7, 3): No triangles formed.
15. Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (8, 7): No triangles formed.
18. Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 3, 7>, <1, 2, 7>
