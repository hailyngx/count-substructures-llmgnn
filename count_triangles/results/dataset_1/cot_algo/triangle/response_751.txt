Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Nodes: 0, 2
Nodes: 4, 7
Nodes: 8
Nodes: 6
Nodes: 1, 5, 9
Nodes: 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we now relabel the nodes:
0 -> 0, 2 -> 1,
4 -> 2, 7 -> 3,
8 -> 4,
6 -> 5,
1 -> 6, 5 -> 7, 9 -> 8,
3 -> 9.

Now, we go through each edge and count the triangles formed:
- Edge (0, 3): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 3): Node 1 has fewer connections than node 3, no triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 5): Node 1 has fewer connections than node 5, forming a triangle with node 3.
- Edge (1, 6): Node 1 has fewer connections than node 6, forming a triangle with node 3.
- Edge (1, 7): Node 1 has fewer connections than node 7, forming a triangle with node 3.
- Edge (2, 9): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 0): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 1): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 5): Node 4 has fewer connections than node 5, no triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 6): Node 4 has fewer connections than node 6, forming a triangle with node 5.
- Edge (4, 9): Node 4 has fewer connections than node 9, no triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 1): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 4): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 8): Node 5 has fewer connections than node 8, no triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 9): Node 5 has fewer connections than node 9, forming a triangle with node 4 and 6.
- Edge (6, 1): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 4): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 7): Node 6 has fewer connections than node 7, forming a triangle with node 4.
- Edge (6, 8): Node 6 has fewer connections than node 8, forming a triangle with node 5.
- Edge (7, 1): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 6):Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 8): Node 7 has fewer connections than node 8, no triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 9): Node 7 has fewer connections than node 9, forming a triangle with node 4 and 6.
- Edge (8, 5): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 6): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 7):Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 2): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 4): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 5): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 7): Both nodes already sorted, no triangle formed.

Now, counting the triangles formed: [4]

The triangles found are: <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <4, 6, 7>.
