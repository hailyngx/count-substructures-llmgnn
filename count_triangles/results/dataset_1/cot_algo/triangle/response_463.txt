Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by the number of connections are:

3 (Degree: 4)
4 (Degree: 3)
5 (Degree: 3)
6 (Degree: 3)
9 (Degree: 3)
1 (Degree: 4)
7 (Degree: 6)
2 (Degree: 5)
8 (Degree: 6)
0 (Degree: 8)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

1. Edge (3, 0) leads to a triangle with shared connection 8: <0, 3, 8>
2. Edge (4, 1) leads to a triangle with shared connection 8: <1, 4, 8>
3. Edge (5, 7) leads to a triangle with shared connection 7: <5, 7, 8>
4. Edge (6, 5) leads to a triangle with shared connection 8: <5, 6, 8>
5. Edge (9, 0) leads to a triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 2, 9>
6. Edge (9, 2) leads to a triangle with shared connection 0: <0, 2, 9>
7. Edge (9, 3) leads to a triangle with shared connection 0: <0, 3, 9>
8. Edge (9, 3) leads to a triangle with shared connection 2: <2, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
