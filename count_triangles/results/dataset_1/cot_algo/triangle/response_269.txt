Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

0 (degree 2), 5 (degree 2), 7 (degree 2), 2 (degree 2), 8 (degree 3), 4 (degree 3), 6 (degree 4), 1 (degree 5), 9 (degree 7), 3 (degree 8).

Now, by following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <0, 3, 1>.
2. Edge (0, 7) does not contribute to any triangles.
3. Edge (1, 2) does not contribute to any triangles.
4. Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <1, 3, 9>.
5. Edge (1, 6) does not contribute to any triangles.
6. Edge (1, 9) does not contribute to any triangles.
7. Edge (2, 1) does not contribute to any triangles.
8. Edge (3, 0) does not contribute to any triangles.
9. Edge (3, 1) does not contribute to any triangles.
10. Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <3, 4, 9>.
11. Edge (3, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <3, 6, 9>.
12. Edge (3, 8) does not contribute to any triangles.
13. Edge (4, 3) does not contribute to any triangles.
14. Edge (4, 5) does not contribute to any triangles.
15. Edge (4, 9) does not contribute to any triangles.
16. Edge (5, 4) does not contribute to any triangles.
17. Edge (6, 1) does not contribute to any triangles.
18. Edge (6, 3) does not contribute to any triangles.
19. Edge (6, 9) does not contribute to any triangles.
20. Edge (7, 0) does not contribute to any triangles.
21. Edge (8, 3) does not contribute to any triangles.
22. Edge (8, 9) does not contribute to any triangles.
23. Edge (9, 1) does not contribute to any triangles.
24. Edge (9, 3) does not contribute to any triangles.
25. Edge (9, 4) does not contribute to any triangles.
26. Edge (9, 6) does not contribute to any triangles.
27. Edge (9, 8) does not contribute to any triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 1>, <3, 4, 9>, and <3, 6, 9>.
