Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree of connections, the labels would be as follows:
Vertex 1 (degree 2)
Vertex 0 (degree 3)
Vertex 5 (degree 3)
Vertex 7 (degree 3)
Vertex 3 (degree 3)
Vertex 6 (degree 4)
Vertex 9 (degree 4)
Vertex 8 (degree 5)
Vertex 4 (degree 6)
Vertex 2 (degree 7)

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles and list them as follows:
Total number of triangles: [23]
