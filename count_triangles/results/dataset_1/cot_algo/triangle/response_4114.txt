Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices and their corresponding degrees:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 3 connections
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 2: 1
- Vertex 7: 2
- Vertex 8: 3
- Vertex 9: 4
- Vertex 1: 5
- Vertex 5: 6
- Vertex 0: 7
- Vertex 4: 8
- Vertex 6: 9
- Vertex 3: 10

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check for triangles:
1. Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Vertex 3 (degree 4). We check for shared connections and find a triangle <0, 3, 8>.
2. Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Vertex 8 (degree 2). No triangle found.
3. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Vertex 9 (degree 2). No triangle found.
4. Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Vertex 2 (degree 1). No triangle found.
5. Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Vertex 3 (degree 4). We find a triangle <1, 3, 6>.
6. Edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Vertex 6 (degree 4). We find a triangle <1, 6, 4>.
7. Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 (degree 4) has more connections than Vertex 8 (degree 2). No triangle found.
8. Edge (4, 3): Vertex 3 (degree 4) has more connections than Vertex 4 (degree 4). No triangle found.
9. Edge (4, 5): Vertex 4 (degree 4) has more connections than Vertex 5 (degree 3). We find a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
10. Edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 (degree 4) has more connections than Vertex 6 (degree 4). No triangle found.
11. Edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 (degree 4) has more connections than Vertex 7 (degree 2). No triangle found.
12. Edge (5, 6): Vertex 5 (degree 3) has fewer connections than Vertex 6 (degree 4). No triangle found.
13. Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 (degree 4) has more connections than Vertex 9 (degree 2). No triangle found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
