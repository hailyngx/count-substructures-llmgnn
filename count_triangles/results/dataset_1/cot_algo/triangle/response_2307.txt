Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices: 7, 0, 6, 9, 5, 1, 3, 4, 8, 2

Now, we will analyze each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 2): Both 0 and 2 have 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 has 3 connections, vertex 3 has 2 connections.
Triangle: <0, 3, 2>
- Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 has 3 connections, vertex 4 has 4 connections.
No triangle is formed.
- Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has 3 connections, vertex 2 has 6 connections.
No triangle is formed.
- Edge (1, 6): Both 1 and 6 have 1 connection. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has 3 connections, vertex 8 has 7 connections.
Triangle: <1, 8, 2>
- Edge (2, 0): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (2, 1): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 has 6 connections, vertex 3 has 2 connections.
No triangle is formed.
- Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 has 6 connections, vertex 4 has 4 connections.
No triangle is formed.
- Edge (2, 8): Vertex 2 has 6 connections, vertex 8 has 7 connections.
Triangle: <2, 8, 1>
- Edge (2, 9): Both 2 and 9 have 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (3, 0): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (3, 2): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 has 2 connections, vertex 8 has 7 connections.
No triangle is formed.
- Edge (4, 0): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (4, 2): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (4, 5): Both 4 and 5 have 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (4, 8): Vertex 4 has 4 connections, vertex 8 has 7 connections.
No triangle is formed.
- Edge (4, 9): Both 4 and 9 have 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5 has 3 connections, vertex 8 has 7 connections.
No triangle is formed.
- Edge (6, 1): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (7, 8): Both 7 and 8 have 1 connection. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (8, 1): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (8, 2): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (8, 3): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (8, 4): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (8, 5): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (8, 7): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (9, 2): This edge has already been considered.
- Edge (9, 4): This edge has already been considered.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is: [2]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 2>, <1, 8, 2>
