Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees. Let's rearrange the nodes accordingly:

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles:

- Node 0 (degree 4) is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 (degree 5) is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 (degree 3) is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Node 7 (degree 4) is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 8 (degree 5) is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6.

Calculating triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (0, 3, 8)
2. (0, 5, 8)
3. (0, 7, 6)
4. (1, 4, 7)
5. (1, 7, 6)
6. (2, 3, 8)
7. (2, 4, 3)
8. (3, 4, 6)
9. (3, 6, 8)
10. (3, 8, 5)
11. (4, 6, 7)
12. (4, 6, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12]. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 3>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 8, 5>, <4, 6, 7>, and <4, 6, 8>.
