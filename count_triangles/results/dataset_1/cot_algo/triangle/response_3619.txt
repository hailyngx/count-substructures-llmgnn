Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's start by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 3: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 3 -> A
Node 7 -> B
Node 6 -> C
Node 5 -> D
Node 2 -> E
Node 1 -> F
Node 0 -> G
Node 9 -> H
Node 8 -> I
Node 4 -> J

Now we will examine each edge, making sure to consider only edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. (A, J): No triangle due to the degree mismatch.
2. (B, D): No triangle due to the degree mismatch.
3. (C, I): No triangle due to the degree mismatch.
4. (D, G): No triangle due to the degree mismatch.
5. (D, J): No triangle due to the degree mismatch.
6. (E, F): No triangle due to the degree mismatch.
7. (E, J): No triangle due to the degree mismatch.
8. (F, E): Triangle <F, E, J>.
9. (G, F): No triangle due to the degree mismatch.
10. (G, H): Triangle <G, H, I>.
11. (G, J): Triangle <G, J, F>.
12. (G, H): Triangle <G, H, I>.
13. (H, G): Triangle <H, G, I>.
14. (I, C): No triangle due to the degree mismatch.
15. (I, J): Triangle <I, J, F>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5], and the unique triangles found are <F, E, J>, <G, H, I>, and <I, J, F>.
