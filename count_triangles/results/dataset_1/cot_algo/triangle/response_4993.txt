Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on their degrees as follows:
Vertices: 7, 3, 0, 5, 2, 9, 1, 6, 4, 8

Based on the edges given, we see that the lower-degree vertex in each edge pair is as follows:
(0, 1) - 0
(0, 8) - 0
(1, 0) - 1
(1, 2) - 1
(1, 8) - 1
(2, 1) - 2
(2, 9) - 2
(3, 4) - 3
(4, 3) - 4
(4, 5) - 4
(4, 6) - 4
(5, 4) - 5
(5, 9) - 5
(6, 4) - 6
(6, 8) - 6
(6, 9) - 6
(7, 8) - 7
(8, 0) - 0
(8, 1) - 1
(8, 6) - 6
(8, 7) - 7
(9, 2) - 2
(9, 5) - 5
(9, 6) - 6

By checking for shared connections between the pairs of vertices, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
