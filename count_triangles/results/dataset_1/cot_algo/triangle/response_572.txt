Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will arrange the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices with their degrees - (0:2) (1:3) (2:3) (4:3) (5:3) (7:2) (9:3) (6:4) (8:6) (3:6)

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method by taking into account the vertices' connections.

Using the provided edges, we find the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles:
<1, 3, 8> - Shared connections: 1 (with 3 and 8)
<1, 4, 8> - Shared connections: 1 (with 4 and 8)
<2, 3, 8> - Shared connections: 2 (with 3 and 8)
<2, 8, 9> - Shared connections: 2 (with 8 and 9)
<4, 1, 8> - Shared connections: 4 (with 1 and 8)
<8, 1, 4> - Shared connections: 8 (with 1 and 4)
<8, 2, 3> - Shared connections: 8 (with 2 and 3)
<8, 2, 9> - Shared connections: 8 (with 2 and 9)

Total number of triangles: [8]
