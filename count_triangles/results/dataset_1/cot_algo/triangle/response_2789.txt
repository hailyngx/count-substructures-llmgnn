Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:

Node 2: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections

Now we will examine each edge based on the vertex with the lower label:

1. Edge (0, 7): Both nodes 0 and 7 have 2 connections. No triangles formed.
2. Edge (0, 8): Node 0 has 2 connections, and node 8 has 5 connections. No triangles formed.
3. Edge (1, 3): Both nodes 1 and 3 have 3 connections. No triangles formed.
4. Edge (1, 5): Both nodes 1 and 5 have 3 connections. No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 8): Node 1 has 3 connections, and node 8 has 5 connections. No triangles formed.
6. Edge (2, 4): Both nodes 2 and 4 have 3 connections. Triangle <2, 4, 5> is formed.
7. Edge (3, 6): Both nodes 3 and 6 have 1 connection. No triangles formed.
8. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 has 3 connections, and node 8 has 5 connections. Triangle <3, 5, 8> is formed.
9. Edge (4, 2): Triangle <2, 4, 5> is already counted.
10. Edge (4, 5): Triangle <2, 4, 5> is already counted.
11. Edge (4, 7): Node 4 has 3 connections, and node 7 has 4 connections. No triangles formed.
12. Edge (5, 1): Triangle <2, 4, 5> is already counted.
13. Edge (5, 8): Triangle <3, 5, 8> is already counted.
14. Edge (6, 3): Both nodes 3 and 6 have 1 connection. No triangles formed.
15. Edge (7, 0): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (7, 9): Node 7 has 4 connections, and node 9 has 1 connection. No triangles formed.
18. Edge (8, 0): No triangles formed.
19. Edge (8, 1): No triangles formed.
20. Edge (8, 3): Triangle <3, 5, 8> is already counted.
21. Edge (8, 5): Triangle <3, 5, 8> is already counted.
22. Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] and the unique triangles found are <2, 4, 5> and <3, 5, 8>.
