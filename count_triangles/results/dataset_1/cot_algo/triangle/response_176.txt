Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the nodes are:  
Node 0: Degree 3  
Node 1: Degree 4  
Node 2: Degree 4  
Node 3: Degree 4  
Node 4: Degree 2  
Node 5: Degree 2  
Node 6: Degree 3  
Node 7: Degree 1  
Node 8: Degree 4  
Node 9: Degree 4  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles.  
Considering edges only where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, the triangles formed are as follows:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 3, 1>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<1, 2, 0>  
<1, 6, 3>  
<2, 4, 9>  
<3, 6, 1>  
<3, 8, 5>  
<4, 9, 6>  
<9, 7, 6>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
