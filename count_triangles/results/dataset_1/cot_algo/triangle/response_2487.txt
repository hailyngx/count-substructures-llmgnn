Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0 (degree 2)  
1 (degree 2)  
3 (degree 0)  
5 (degree 1)  
8 (degree 1)  
9 (degree 2)  
7 (degree 6)  
6 (degree 3)  
4 (degree 3)  
2 (degree 6)  

Now we relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 -> 0  
1 -> 1  
3 -> 2  
5 -> 3  
8 -> 4  
9 -> 5  
7 -> 6  
6 -> 7  
4 -> 8  
2 -> 9  

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (0, 2):
   Both vertices have degree 2. No triangles.
   
2. (0, 9):
   Both vertices have degree 2. No triangles.

3. (1, 4):
   Both vertices have degree 2. No triangles.

4. (1, 7):
   Node 1 (degree 2) is less than node 6 (degree 6).
   Shared connections: 7
   Triangle: <1, 7, 6>

5. (2, 0):
   Both vertices have degree 2. No triangles.

6. (2, 6):
   Both vertices have degree 2. No triangles.

7. (2, 7):
   Node 2 (degree 6) is greater than node 6 (degree 3).
   Cannot proceed.

8. (2, 8):
   Node 2 (degree 6) is greater than node 4 (degree 3).
   Cannot proceed.

9. (4, 1):
   Both vertices have degree 2. No triangles.

10. (4, 7):
    Node 4 (degree 3) is less than node 6 (degree 6).
    Shared connections: 1
    Triangle: <4, 1, 7>

11. (5, 7):
    Both vertices have degree 1. No triangles.

12. (6, 2):
    Node 6 (degree 3) is less than node 9 (degree 6).
    Shared connections: 2
    Triangle: <6, 2, 7>

13. (6, 9):
    Node 6 (degree 3) is less than node 5 (degree 2).
    Shared connections: 9, 0
    Triangles: <6, 9, 0>; <6, 9, 2>; <6, 9, 7>;

14. (7, 1):
    Node 7 (degree 6) is greater than node 1 (degree 2).
    Cannot proceed.

15. (7, 2):
    Node 7 (degree 6) is greater than node 9 (degree 6).
    Cannot proceed.

16. (7, 4):
    Node 7 (degree 6) is greater than node 4 (degree 3).
    Cannot proceed.

17. (7, 5):
    Node 7 (degree 6) is greater than node 1 (degree 2).
    Cannot proceed.

18. (8, 2):
    Node 8 (degree 1) is less than node 9 (degree 6).
    No triangles.

19. (9, 0):
    Both vertices have degree 2. No triangles.

20. (9, 6):
    Node 9 (degree 6) is greater than node 7 (degree 6).
    Cannot proceed.

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [5].
Unique triangles found are: <4, 1, 7>, <1, 7, 6>, <6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 2>, <6, 9, 7>.
