Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we get the following order: <5, 9, 6, 0, 3, 1, 2, 7, 8, 4> based on the number of connections each vertex has. 

Now, let's count the triangles formed by the edges in this graph:
We find the following triangles:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
