Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
```
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
```
Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:
```
Node 1 (degree 2) -> Node 1
Node 3 (degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 4 (degree 2) -> Node 3
Node 6 (degree 2) -> Node 4
Node 7 (degree 4) -> Node 5
Node 8 (degree 2) -> Node 6
```
We will now analyze the edges in the graph based on the relabeled vertices:
```
(1, 3) -> (Node 1, Node 2) forms the triangle <1, 2, 3>
(1, 8) -> (Node 1, Node 6) does not form a triangle
(3, 1) -> (Node 2, Node 1) forms the triangle <1, 2, 3>
(3, 8) -> (Node 2, Node 6) forms the triangle <1, 2, 6>
(4, 7) -> (Node 3, Node 5) does not form a triangle
(6, 7) -> (Node 4, Node 5) does not form a triangle
(7, 4) -> (Node 5, Node 3) does not form a triangle
(7, 6) -> (Node 5, Node 4) does not form a triangle
(8, 1) -> (Node 6, Node 1) does not form a triangle
(8, 3) -> (Node 6, Node 2) forms the triangle <1, 2, 6>
```
From the analysis above, we have found the following unique triangles: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 6>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2, and it can be represented as [2].
