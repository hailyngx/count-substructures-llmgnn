Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Nodes 4, 7, 9 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 1 and 5 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 0 and 2 have 5 connections each.
Node 8 has 6 connections.

Therefore, the edges to consider in increasing order are: (6, 4), (3, 8), (9, 3), (4, 6), (7, 2), (7, 8), (5, 4), (5, 1), (5, 8), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 9), (0, 1), (0, 2), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 2).

By following these edges and looking for shared connections, we find that there are 8 triangles in total:
[8]

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
