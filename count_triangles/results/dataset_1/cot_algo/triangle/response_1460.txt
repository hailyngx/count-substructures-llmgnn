Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have the following relabeling:
(4, 9, 3, 5, 7, 0, 6, 2, 1, 8)

With this new labeling, let's identify the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles:
[26]
<1, 0, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 7, 3>
<6, 5, 8>
