Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new vertex labels are:
- Vertex 1 (Node 6) - Degree: 0
- Vertex 2 (Node 1) - Degree: 1
- Vertex 3 (Node 5) - Degree: 1
- Vertex 4 (Node 4) - Degree: 2
- Vertex 5 (Node 8) - Degree: 3
- Vertex 6 (Node 3) - Degree: 3
- Vertex 7 (Node 2) - Degree: 3
- Vertex 8 (Node 9) - Degree: 4
- Vertex 9 (Node 7) - Degree: 4
- Vertex 10 (Node 0) - Degree: 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
