Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Vertex 5: 1 connection  
Vertex 6: 1 connection  
Vertex 2: 1 connection  
Vertex 3: 2 connections  
Vertex 1: 2 connections  
Vertex 7: 3 connections  
Vertex 8: 4 connections  
Vertex 9: 5 connections  
Vertex 4: 6 connections  
Vertex 0: 7 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
The triangles formed by these edges are:

<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 4, 6>  
<0, 4, 7>  
<0, 4, 8>  
<0, 4, 9>  
<0, 7, 9>  
<3, 1, 9>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 6, 9>  
<4, 7, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
