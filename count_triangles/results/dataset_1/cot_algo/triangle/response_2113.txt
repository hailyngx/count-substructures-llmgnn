Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to list the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
Vertices: 3, 7, 4, 8, 9, 1, 2, 0, 6, 5

Then, we relabel the vertices based on their degree:
Vertex 3 is relabeled as 0
Vertex 7 is relabeled as 1
Vertex 4 is relabeled as 2
Vertex 8 is relabeled as 3
Vertex 9 is relabeled as 4
Vertex 1 is relabeled as 5
Vertex 2 is relabeled as 6
Vertex 0 is relabeled as 7
Vertex 6 is relabeled as 8
Vertex 5 is relabeled as 9

Now, we analyze each edge:
(0, 2): Both vertices have degree 2, proceed.
Shared connections: 5
Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>

(0, 6): Vertex 0 has degree 2, proceed.
Shared connections: None

(0, 9): Vertex 0 has degree 2, proceed.
Shared connections: None

(1, 5): Vertex 1 has degree 3, proceed.
Shared connections: 6
Triangle formed: <1, 5, 6>

(1, 6): Vertex 1 has degree 3, proceed.
Shared connections: None

(1, 8): Vertex 1 has degree 3, proceed.
Shared connections: None

(2, 5): Vertex 2 has degree 2, proceed.
Shared connections: None

(5, 6): Vertex 5 has degree 4, proceed.
Shared connections: 1
Triangle formed: <5, 6, 1>

(5, 7): Vertex 5 has degree 4, proceed.
Shared connections: None

(5, 9): Vertex 5 has degree 4, proceed.
Shared connections: 2, 6
Triangles formed: <5, 9, 2>, <5, 9, 6>

(6, 8): Vertex 6 has degree 4, proceed.
Shared connections: None

(9, 3): Vertex 9 has degree 4, proceed.
Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <5, 9, 2>, <5, 9, 6>
