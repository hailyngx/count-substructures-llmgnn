Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

Node 0 has 1 connection.
Node 2 has 1 connection.
Node 4 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.
Node 1 has 6 connections.
Node 3 has 6 connections.

Now, starting from the edge with the vertex with the lower label and proceeding only when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 and Node 1 share Node 5 as a common connection. <0, 1, 5>
2. Edge (2, 5): Node 2 and Node 5 do not form a triangle.
3. Edge (4, 9): Node 4 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.
4. Edge (7, 8): Node 7 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.
5. Edge (7, 9): Node 7 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.

Count of triangles inside brackets: [1]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 5>
