Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles can be applied to this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges. Let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices by degree:
1. Vertex 7 connects to 1 node.
2. Vertex 1 connects to 1 node.
3. Vertex 5 connects to 2 nodes.
4. Vertex 6 connects to 2 nodes.
5. Vertex 0 connects to 3 nodes.
6. Vertex 9 connects to 3 nodes.
7. Vertex 4 connects to 3 nodes.
8. Vertex 8 connects to 4 nodes.
9. Vertex 3 connects to 4 nodes.
10. Vertex 2 connects to 4 nodes.

Now, we will label the vertices according to their degree:

Vertices by label:
1. Vertex 7 (degree: 1)
2. Vertex 1 (degree: 1)
3. Vertex 5 (degree: 2)
4. Vertex 6 (degree: 2)
5. Vertex 0 (degree: 3)
6. Vertex 9 (degree: 3)
7. Vertex 4 (degree: 3)
8. Vertex 8 (degree: 4)
9. Vertex 3 (degree: 4)
10. Vertex 2 (degree: 4)

Next, we will analyze the edges in ascending order based on the vertex labels. Only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections will be considered:

Triangles formed:
1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 5, 3>
4. <0, 5, 3>
5. <0, 5, 3>
6. <2, 0, 3>
7. <2, 0, 8>
8. <2, 3, 8>
9. <2, 0, 5>
10. <2, 3, 9>
11. <3, 4, 8>
12. <3, 4, 9>
13. <4, 6, 8>
14. <4, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [14]
