Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels are as follows:
- Node 3 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 4 and 9 have 1 connection.
- Nodes 7 and 8 have 2 connections.
- Nodes 2 and 6 have 3 connections.
- Nodes 1 and 5 have 5 connections.
- Node 0 has 6 connections.

Now, by following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles. 

We find the following:

- Triangles involving Node 0:
  - <0, 1, 6>
  - <0, 2, 5>

- Triangles involving Node 1:
  - No new triangles.

- Triangles involving Node 2:
  - No new triangles.

- Triangles involving Node 3:
  - No new triangles.

- Triangles involving Node 4:
  - No new triangles.

- Triangles involving Node 5:
  - No new triangles.

- Triangles involving Node 6:
  - No new triangles.

- Triangles involving Node 7:
  - <5, 7, 1>
  - <6, 7, 1>

- Triangles involving Node 8:
  - No new triangles.

- Triangles involving Node 9:
  - No new triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
