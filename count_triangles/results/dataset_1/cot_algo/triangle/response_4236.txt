Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices:

Vertex 1: Connections - 2
Vertex 3: Connections - 2
Vertex 2: Connections - 2
Vertex 9: Connections - 1
Vertex 0: Connections - 2
Vertex 4: Connections - 4
Vertex 5: Connections - 5
Vertex 7: Connections - 4
Vertex 8: Connections - 5
Vertex 6: Connections - 7

Since vertex 1 and 3 have the same number of connections, let's consider the edges involving these vertices following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (1, 5): Shared connection with vertex 5, so triangle <1, 5, 2>.
2. Edge (1, 7): Shared connection with vertex 7, so triangle <1, 7, 4>.
3. Edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (3, 6): Shared connection with vertex 6, so triangle <3, 6, 4>.
5. Edge (3, 8): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <1, 5, 2>, <1, 7, 4>, and <3, 6, 4>.
