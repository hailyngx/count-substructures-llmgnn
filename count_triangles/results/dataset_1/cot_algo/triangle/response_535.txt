Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on their number of connections in ascending order: 5, 9, 0, 4, 8, 7, 6, 3, 1, 2.

After applying the DB-Ordering, the new edges are: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 0) (0, 4) (4, 8) (8, 7) (7, 6) (6, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (3, 7) (4, 3) (6, 7) (8, 1).

Now, we can count the number of triangles:

- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <6, 7, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
