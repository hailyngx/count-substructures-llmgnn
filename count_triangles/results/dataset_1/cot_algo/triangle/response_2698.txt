Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 0 - Degree 1
Vertex 1 - Degree 1
Vertex 6 - Degree 2
Vertex 9 - Degree 3
Vertex 4 - Degree 3
Vertex 8 - Degree 3
Vertex 2 - Degree 4
Vertex 7 - Degree 5
Vertex 3 - Degree 6
Vertex 5 - Degree 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles formed by the edges. 

Calculating the triangles:
1. (0, 5) and (5, 4) share vertex 5: <0, 5, 4>
2. (1, 9) and (9, 7) share vertex 9: <1, 9, 7>
3. (2, 3) and (3, 2) share vertex 2: <2, 3, 4>
4. (2, 3) and (3, 5) share edge 3: <2, 3, 5>
5. (2, 4) and (4, 5) share vertex 4: <2, 4, 5>
6. (5, 0) and (0, 5) share vertex 5: <5, 0, 4>
7. (5, 3) and (3, 5) share vertex 3: <5, 3, 4>
8. (5, 4) and (4, 5) share vertex 5: <5, 4, 2>
9. (5, 4) and (4, 5) share vertex 5: <5, 4, 3>
10. (5, 7) and (7, 6) share vertex 7: <5, 7, 6>
11. (5, 7) and (7, 9) share vertex 7: <5, 7, 9>
12. (5, 7) and (7, 8) share vertex 7: <5, 7, 8>
13. (7, 6) and (6, 7) share vertex 6: <7, 6, 5>
14. (7, 6) and (6, 7) share vertex 7: <7, 6, 8>
15. (7, 6) and (6, 7) share vertex 7: <7, 6, 9>
16. (7, 8) and (8, 7) share vertex 8: <7, 8, 3>
17. (7, 8) and (8, 9) share vertex 8: <7, 8, 9>
18. (7, 9) and (9, 7) share vertex 9: <7, 9, 1>
19. (7, 9) and (9, 1) share vertex 9: <7, 9, 8>
20. (7, 9) and (9, 8) share vertex 9: <7, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [20].
