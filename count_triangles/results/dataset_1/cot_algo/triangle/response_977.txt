Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, the order is as follows:
Node 3, Node 5, Node 2, Node 7, Node 0, Node 6, Node 4, Node 1, Node 9, Node 8.

Using the degree-based ordering method to count triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 and Node 1 have shared connections with Node 7, forming a triangle <0, 1, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 7): Node 0 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 and Node 6 have shared connections with Node 4, forming a triangle <1, 6, 4>.
4. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.
5. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.
6. Edge (4, 6): Node 4 and Node 6 do not form a triangle.
7. Edge (4, 7): Node 4 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.
8. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.
9. Edge (5, 9): Node 5 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.
10. Edge (6, 1): Node 6 and Node 1 have shared connections with Node 4, forming a triangle <6, 1, 4>.
11. Edge (6, 4): Node 6 and Node 4 have shared connections with Node 1, forming a triangle <6, 4, 1>.
12. Edge (7, 0): Node 7 and Node 0 have shared connections with Node 4, forming a triangle <7, 0, 4>.
13. Edge (7, 4): Node 7 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.
14. Edge (8, 3): Node 8 and Node 3 do not form a triangle.
15. Edge (8, 4): Node 8 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.
16. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.
17. Edge (9, 1): Node 9 and Node 1 do not form a triangle.
18. Edge (9, 5): Node 9 and Node 5 do not form a triangle.
19. Edge (9, 8): Node 9 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
