Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:
Vertices: 7 0 2 8 4 1 9 3 5 6

Calculating the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 3): forms a triangle with node 1. Triangle <0, 3, 1>
- Edge (0, 6): no triangle formed
- Edge (1, 3): no triangle formed
- Edge (1, 9): no triangle formed
- Edge (2, 5): no triangle formed
- Edge (3, 0): already counted
- Edge (3, 1): already counted
- Edge (3, 4): forms a triangle with node 5. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
- Edge (3, 9): no triangle formed
- Edge (4, 3): already counted
- Edge (4, 5): already counted
- Edge (5, 2): no triangle formed
- Edge (5, 4): already counted
- Edge (5, 6): forms a triangle with node 0. Triangle <5, 6, 0>
- Edge (5, 8): no triangle formed
- Edge (5, 9): no triangle formed
- Edge (6, 0): already counted
- Edge (6, 5): already counted
- Edge (6, 7): no triangle formed
- Edge (7, 6): no triangle formed
- Edge (8, 5): no triangle formed
- Edge (9, 1): already counted
- Edge (9, 3): already counted
- Edge (9, 5): already counted

Total number of triangles: 3
Triangles: <0, 3, 1>, <3, 4, 5>, <5, 6, 0>
