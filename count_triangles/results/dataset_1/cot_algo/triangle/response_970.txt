Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Node 0 - degree 5  
Node 1 - degree 2  
Node 2 - degree 2  
Node 3 - degree 3  
Node 4 - degree 4  
Node 5 - degree 2  
Node 6 - degree 1  
Node 7 - degree 3  
Node 8 - degree 2  
Node 9 - degree 5  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles.  

Number of triangles: [8]  
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 3>
