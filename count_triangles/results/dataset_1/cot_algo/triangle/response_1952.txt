Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:

- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 1
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 3
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 1 (degree 1) will become Vertex 0
- Vertices 6, 8, and 9 (degree 2) will become Vertices 1, 2, and 3 (in ascending order of their original labels)
- Vertices 0, 2, 4, and 5 (degree 3) will become Vertices 4, 5, 6, and 7 (in ascending order of their original labels)
- Vertices 3 and 7 (degree 4) will become Vertices 8 and 9 (in ascending order of their original labels)

The sorted list of edges based on the relabeled vertices:
- (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangles <0, 3, 5>
- Triangles <2, 4, 6>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
