Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 6 is connected to 2 nodes.
Node 9 is connected to 1 nodes.
Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes.
Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes.
Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes.
Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes.
Node 3 is connected to 4 nodes.
Node 2 is connected to 4 nodes.
Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes.
Node 5 is connected to 7 nodes.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
We find the following triangles: <3, 5, 4>, <5, 4, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
