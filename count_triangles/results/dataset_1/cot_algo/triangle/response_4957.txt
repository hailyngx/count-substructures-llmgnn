Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 

Node 4 (Degree 1)
Node 5 (Degree 1)
Node 2 (Degree 2)
Node 5 (Degree 2)
Node 7 (Degree 2)
Node 1 (Degree 2)
Node 6 (Degree 3)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 8 (Degree 5)
Node 9 (Degree 7)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we'll explore the edges in the following order: 

(4, 6)
(5, 2)
(5, 7)
(2, 3)
(7, 1)
(6, 0)
(3, 8)
(8, 9)

Now, let's count the number of triangles: 

[12]

The unique triangles are: 
<3, 0, 6>
<3, 1, 7>
<8, 0, 9>
<9, 6, 0>
<9, 6, 4>
<9, 7, 1>
<9, 7, 0>
<8, 3, 1>
<8, 3, 0>
<8, 2, 5>
<6, 0, 4>
<7, 1, 3>
