Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
1. 1 (degree 1)
2. 5 (degree 1)
3. 9 (degree 1)
4. 4 (degree 2)
5. 5 (degree 2)
6. 2 (degree 3)
7. 6 (degree 4)
8. 1 (degree 4)
9. 9 (degree 4)
10. 8 (degree 5)

Now, we analyze the edges based on the vertices' labels and degrees to count the triangles.

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 7, 8>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <0, 6, 4>
5. <4, 6, 7>
6. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
