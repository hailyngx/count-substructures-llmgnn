Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0: label 2
- Node 4: label 2
- Node 5: label 3
- Node 6: label 2
- Node 8: label 2
- Node 1: label 4
- Node 3: label 5
- Node 9: label 5
- Node 7: label 6
- Node 2: label 6

Now we will list the edges in increasing order of the labels of the nodes:
(0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (5, 7), (5, 9)

Now we will count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle 2: <1, 2, 3>
- Triangle 3: <2, 3, 4>
- Triangle 4: <2, 3, 7>
- Triangle 5: <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle 6: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 7: <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle 8: <1, 3, 9>
- Triangle 9: <2, 3, 7>
- Triangle 10: <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle 11: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 12: <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle 13: <2, 7, 8>
- Triangle 14: <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle 15: <2, 8, 9>
- Triangle 16: <3, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [16]
