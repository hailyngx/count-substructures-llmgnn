Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Now, we consider each edge and count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections:
- Edge (0, 1) forms the triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- Edge (0, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 3) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
