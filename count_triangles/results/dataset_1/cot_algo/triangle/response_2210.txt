Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degrees:
    Node 7: Degree 1
    Node 6: Degree 2
    Node 5: Degree 2
    Node 2: Degree 3
    Node 1: Degree 3
    Node 5: Degree 3
    Node 4: Degree 4
    Node 8: Degree 4
    Node 3: Degree 5
    Node 0: Degree 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting triangles:

Triangles:
    Total count: [4]
    Unique triangles: <0, 3, 6> <0, 4, 6> <0, 4, 5> <1, 3, 9>
