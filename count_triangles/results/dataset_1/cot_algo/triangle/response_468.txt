Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles formed by the edges in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
