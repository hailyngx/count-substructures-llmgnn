Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by the number of connections are: 
Vertex 1: 2 connections 
Vertex 8: 2 connections 
Vertex 0: 3 connections 
Vertex 3: 3 connections 
Vertex 4: 4 connections 
Vertex 5: 4 connections 
Vertex 6: 5 connections 
Vertex 7: 5 connections 
Vertex 9: 5 connections 

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
1. Start with the edges involving Vertex 0 (3 connections), as it has the lowest label among vertices with 3 connections:
    - (0, 3) shares a connection with (3, 6) to form a triangle <0, 3, 6>.
    - (0, 5) shares a connection with (5, 6) to form a triangle <0, 5, 6>.
2. Move on to the edges involving Vertex 1 (2 connections):
    - No triangles can be formed with Vertex 1.
3. Next, consider the edges involving Vertex 3 (3 connections):
    - No triangles can be formed with Vertex 3 that haven't already been counted.
4. Proceed to the edges involving Vertex 4 (4 connections):
    - No triangles can be formed with Vertex 4.
5. Move on to the edges involving Vertex 5 (4 connections):
    - No additional triangles can be formed with Vertex 5.
6. Consider the edges involving Vertex 6 (5 connections):
    - (6, 5) shares a connection with (5, 7) to form a triangle <6, 5, 7>.
7. Next, look at the edges involving Vertex 7 (5 connections):
    - No additional triangles can be formed with Vertex 7.
8. Finally, check the edges involving Vertex 9 (5 connections):
    - No triangles can be formed with Vertex 9.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, and <6, 5, 7>.
