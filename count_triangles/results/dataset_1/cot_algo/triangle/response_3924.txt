Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:

Vertex 0 has 1 connection  
Vertex 1 has 2 connections  
Vertex 2 has 3 connections  
Vertex 3 has 4 connections  
Vertex 4 has 3 connections  
Vertex 5 has 2 connections  
Vertex 6 has 1 connection  
Vertex 7 has 7 connections  
Vertex 9 has 5 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:  
(0, 7), (1, 3), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)

By considering each edge, we find the triangles:

<3, 1, 7>  
<3, 2, 7>  
<3, 4, 9>  

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
