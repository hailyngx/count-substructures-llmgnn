Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
0 - 2 connections
1 - 5 connections
3 - 1 connection
5 - 3 connections
4 - 3 connections
6 - 4 connections
7 - 4 connections
8 - 5 connections
2 - 3 connections
9 - 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph.

[Total number of triangles: 8]

Unique triangles:
<1, 8, 4>
<1, 8, 7>
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 6, 5>
<2, 8, 7>
<6, 9, 7>
<6, 8, 7>
