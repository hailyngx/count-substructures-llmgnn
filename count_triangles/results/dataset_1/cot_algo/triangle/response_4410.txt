Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 3 has degree 1.
Nodes 1, 6, and 7 have degree 1.
Nodes 0 and 5 have degree 2.
Nodes 4 and 9 have degree 3.
Nodes 2 and 8 have degree 4.

Now, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 3 is relabeled as 0.
Nodes 1, 6, and 7 are relabeled as 1.
Nodes 0 and 5 are relabeled as 2.
Nodes 4 and 9 are relabeled as 3.
Nodes 2 and 8 are relabeled as 4.

Next, we consider each edge in the graph where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

For the edge between vertices 0 and 2:
- Both vertices have degree 2.
- They share vertex 5.
- Triangle: <0, 2, 5>.

For the edge between vertices 0 and 6:
- Vertex 6 has degree 1, which is lower than vertex 0.
- Thus, this edge is not considered.

For the edge between vertices 1 and 5:
- Both vertices have degree 2.
- They share vertex 2.
- Triangle: <1, 2, 5>.

For the edge between vertices 2 and 4:
- Both vertices have degree 4.
- They share vertex 8.
- Triangle: <2, 4, 8>.

For the edge between vertices 2 and 5:
- Vertex 5 has degree 2, which is lower than vertex 2.
- Thus, this edge is not considered.

For the edge between vertices 2 and 8:
- Vertex 8 has degree 4, which is lower than vertex 2.
- Thus, this edge is not considered.

For the edge between vertices 3 and 7:
- Vertex 7 has degree 1, which is lower than vertex 3.
- Thus, this edge is not considered.

For the edge between vertices 4 and 9:
- Vertex 9 has degree 3, which is lower than vertex 4.
- Thus, this edge is not considered.

For the edge between vertices 8 and 9:
- Vertex 9 has degree 3, which is lower than vertex 8.
- They share vertex 4.
- Triangle: <4, 8, 9>.

The total number of triangles formed in the graph is 3, and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, and <2, 4, 8>. Therefore, the output is [3].
