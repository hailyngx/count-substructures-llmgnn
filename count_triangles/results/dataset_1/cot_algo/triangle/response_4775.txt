Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
We will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Node 1: Degree 1
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 1 -> Node 0
Node 0 -> Node 1
Node 4 -> Node 2
Node 6 -> Node 3
Node 8 -> Node 4
Node 3 -> Node 5
Node 5 -> Node 6
Node 7 -> Node 7
Node 2 -> Node 8

Next, we will go through each edge, considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 2): Nodes 1 and 8 have a shared connection (Node 7), forming a triangle: <1, 8, 7>
- Edge (0, 4): No triangle formed
- Edge (1, 3): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 0): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 5): Nodes 8 and 6 have a shared connection (Node 3), forming a triangle: <8, 6, 3>
- Edge (2, 7): No triangle formed
- Edge (3, 1): No triangle formed
- Edge (3, 7): No triangle formed
- Edge (4, 0): No triangle formed
- Edge (4, 6): No triangle formed
- Edge (5, 2): Nodes 6 and 3 have a shared connection (Node 8), forming a triangle: <6, 3, 8>
- Edge (5, 6): Nodes 6 and 3 have a shared connection (Node 8), forming a triangle: <6, 3, 8>
- Edge (5, 8): Nodes 6 and 3 have a shared connection (Node 8), forming a triangle: <6, 3, 8>
- Edge (6, 4): No triangle formed
- Edge (6, 5): No triangle formed
- Edge (7, 2): Nodes 7 and 8 have a shared connection (Node 3), forming a triangle: <7, 8, 3>
- Edge (7, 3): No triangle formed
- Edge (7, 8): Nodes 8 and 3 have a shared connection (Node 6), forming a triangle: <8, 3, 6>
- Edge (8, 5): Nodes 3 and 6 have a shared connection (Node 8), forming a triangle: <3, 6, 8>
- Edge (8, 7): No triangle formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
