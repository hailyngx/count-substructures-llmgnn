Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 5: degree 1
Node 4: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 0: degree 2
Node 9: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 6: degree 5
Node 3: degree 8

Now, we will go through each edge based on the ordering of nodes and count the triangles.

Triangles:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [14]
