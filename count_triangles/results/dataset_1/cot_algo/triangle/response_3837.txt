Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections), from least to most connections. The vertices will be relabeled accordingly:

Vertices by their degree:
1. 3
2. 7
3. 5
4. 0
5. 3
6. 2
7. 7
8. 9
9. 9
10. 6

Now, we check each edge based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:

Triangles found:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <4, 8, 9>
3. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
