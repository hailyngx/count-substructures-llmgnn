Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 4, 6, 8, 3, 5, 1, 9, 7, 2, 0.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles, we find the following triangles: 
1. <0, 6, 7>
2. 
3.
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
8. 

There are a total of 1 triangles. [1]
