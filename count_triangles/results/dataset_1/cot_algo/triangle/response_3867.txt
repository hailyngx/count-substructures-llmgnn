Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's first relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection

The edges with the vertex labels (lower label, higher label) are:
(0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8)

Now let's count the number of triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <3, 5, 9>

There are 3 triangles in total. Therefore, the answer is [3].
