Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

- Node 0 has 2 connections.
- Node 7 has 2 connections.
- Node 9 has 2 connections.
- Node 3 has 2 connections.
- Node 2 has 2 connections.
- Node 8 has 3 connections.
- Node 6 has 3 connections.
- Node 1 has 4 connections.
- Node 5 has 4 connections.
- Node 4 has 5 connections.

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on the number of connections:

- Node 0 (2 connections) --> Node 0
- Node 7 (2 connections) --> Node 1
- Node 9 (2 connections) --> Node 2
- Node 3 (2 connections) --> Node 3
- Node 2 (2 connections) --> Node 4
- Node 8 (3 connections) --> Node 5
- Node 6 (3 connections) --> Node 6
- Node 1 (4 connections) --> Node 7
- Node 5 (4 connections) --> Node 8
- Node 4 (5 connections) --> Node 9

Now, let's go through each edge following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 6) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
2. Edge (0, 7) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
3. Edge (1, 4) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
4. Edge (1, 6) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
5. Edge (1, 7) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
6. Edge (2, 4) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
7. Edge (2, 8) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
8. Edge (3, 5) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
9. Edge (3, 8) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
10. Edge (4, 1) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
11. Edge (4, 2) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
12. Edge (4, 5) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: Node 9
        - Triangle: <4, 5, 9>
13. Edge (4, 9) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
14. Edge (5, 3) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
15. Edge (5, 4) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: Node 9
        - Triangle: Already counted
16. Edge (5, 9) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: Node 4
        - Triangle: Already counted
17. Edge (6, 0) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
18. Edge (6, 1) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
19. Edge (6, 8) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
20. Edge (7, 0) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
21. Edge (7, 1) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
22. Edge (8, 2) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
23. Edge (8, 3) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
24. Edge (8, 6) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
25. Edge (9, 4) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None
26. Edge (9, 5) - Proceed
    - Shared connections: None

The total number of triangles is [1], and the unique triangle found is <4, 5, 9>.
