Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we have the following order: 

Vertex 5 (degree 2), Vertex 4 (degree 3), Vertex 2 (degree 3), Vertex 8 (degree 3), Vertex 6 (degree 3), Vertex 0 (degree 3), Vertex 1 (degree 4), Vertex 9 (degree 5), Vertex 7 (degree 6), Vertex 3 (degree 7).

Using this order, we will traverse the edges and count the number of triangles in the graph.

Number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles: <0, 3, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 8>.
