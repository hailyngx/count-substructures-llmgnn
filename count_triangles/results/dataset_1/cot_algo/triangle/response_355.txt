Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The degrees of the vertices are as follows: 
Vertex 1: Degree 0
Vertex 3: Degree 0
Vertex 6: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 4: Degree 5
Vertex 2: Degree 5
Vertex 0: Degree 5
Vertex 8: Degree 6
Vertex 9: Degree 7

We will now relabel the vertices accordingly. 
Vertex 1 -> Vertex 0
Vertex 3 -> Vertex 1
Vertex 6 -> Vertex 2
Vertex 5 -> Vertex 3
Vertex 7 -> Vertex 4
Vertex 4 -> Vertex 5
Vertex 2 -> Vertex 6
Vertex 0 -> Vertex 7
Vertex 8 -> Vertex 8
Vertex 9 -> Vertex 9

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
[12]

Unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <8, 9, 7>.
