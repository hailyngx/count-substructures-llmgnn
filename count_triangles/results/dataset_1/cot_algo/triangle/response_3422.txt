Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them, the new graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 6) (7, 9)

We will now count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 7, so we check for shared connections. Both are connected to vertices 8 and 9, forming a triangle <0, 8, 9>.

2. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 9, but there are no shared connections, so no triangles are formed.

3. Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 8, so we check for shared connections. Both are connected to vertices 7 and 9, forming a triangle <0, 7, 9>.

4. Edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 4, so we check for shared connections. Both are connected to vertex 5, forming a triangle <1, 4, 5>.

5. Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 5, but there are no shared connections, so no triangles are formed.

6. Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 8, but there are no shared connections, so no triangles are formed.

7. Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 6, so we check for shared connections. Both are connected to vertex 9, forming a triangle <2, 6, 9>.

8. Edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 9, but there are no shared connections, so no triangles are formed.

9. Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 7, so we check for shared connections. Both are connected to vertex 9, forming a triangle <2, 7, 9>.

10. Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 4, so we check for shared connections. Both are connected to vertex 8, forming a triangle <3, 4, 8>.

11. Edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 6, but there are no shared connections, so no triangles are formed.

12. Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 8, but there are no shared connections, so no triangles are formed.

13. Edge (4, 5): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 5, but there are no shared connections, so no triangles are formed.

14. Edge (5, 6): Vertex 5 has fewer connections than vertex 6, but there are no shared connections, so no triangles are formed.

15. Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has fewer connections than vertex 9, but there are no shared connections, so no triangles are formed.

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are <0, 8, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, and <2, 6, 9>.
