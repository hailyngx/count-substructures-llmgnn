Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the nodes by their degree:

Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 1
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 1
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 1

Next, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 1: degree 1
Node 7: degree 1
Node 9: degree 1
Node 2: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4

Now, following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

1. Edge (1, 6): Forms a triangle with node 0 as <0, 1, 6>.
2. Edge (7, 4): Forms a triangle with node 3 as <3, 4, 7>.
3. Edge (9, 5): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (8, 4): Forms a triangle with node 6 as <4, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
