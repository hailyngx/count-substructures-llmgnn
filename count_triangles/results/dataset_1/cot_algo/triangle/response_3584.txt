Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Relabel the vertices based on the number of connections:
   - Node 0 (Degree 2) -> Label 0
   - Node 1 (Degree 3) -> Label 1
   - Node 3 (Degree 2) -> Label 2
   - Node 4 (Degree 2) -> Label 3
   - Node 5 (Degree 4) -> Label 4
   - Node 6 (Degree 4) -> Label 5
   - Node 7 (Degree 3) -> Label 6
   - Node 8 (Degree 3) -> Label 7
   - Node 9 (Degree 2) -> Label 8
   - Node 2 (Degree 5) -> Label 9

2. Count the triangles:
   - Triangles: <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 0>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [6]
