Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections, we get the following order: 3, 5, 2, 0, 7, 1, 6, 9, 8, 4.

After relabeling the nodes accordingly, the edges that we can use because the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections are: (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5).

Now, we will count the triangles formed by these edges:

1. Triangle <1, 3, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
5. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
6. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
