Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the vertices based on their degree:  
Vertex 0 has degree 3  
Vertex 1 has degree 1  
Vertex 2 has degree 2  
Vertex 3 has degree 2  
Vertex 4 has degree 4  
Vertex 5 has degree 2  
Vertex 6 has degree 2  
Vertex 7 has degree 2  
Vertex 8 has degree 3  
Vertex 9 has degree 1  

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on degree, resulting in the following order:  
Vertices with degree 1: 1, 9  
Vertices with degree 2: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7  
Vertices with degree 3: 0, 8  
Vertices with degree 4: 4  

Now let's examine the edges based on the relabeled vertices:  
(0, 3) - Form a triangle with vertex 1: <0, 1, 3>  
(0, 4) - Form a triangle with vertices 2, 3, 5, 6, 7: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 7, 4>  
(0, 7) - Form a triangle with vertices 2, 3: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 7>  
(1, 3) - No triangle  
(2, 4) - No triangle  
(2, 7) - No triangle  
(4, 5) - Form a triangle with vertex 6: <4, 5, 6>  
(4, 6) - Form a triangle with vertex 5: <4, 5, 6>  
(5, 8) - Form a triangle with vertex 6: <5, 6, 8>  
(6, 8) - No triangle  
(8, 9) - No triangle  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is 10, and the unique triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>  

So, the final output is [10].
