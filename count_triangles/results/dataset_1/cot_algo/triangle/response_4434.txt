Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 5: 0 connections  
Node 10: 0 connections  
Node 7: 1 connection  
Node 6: 1 connection  
Node 2: 1 connection  
Node 5: 2 connections  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  

Now, we will label the nodes accordingly:  
Node 5: 0  
Node 10: 0  
Node 7: 1  
Node 6: 1  
Node 2: 2  
Node 5: 2  
Node 3: 3  
Node 1: 4  
Node 8: 5  
Node 4: 6  

Next, we will identify the triangles formed by shared connections:
(1, 3) - Shared connection: 4  
(1, 4) - No shared connection  
(2, 4) - No shared connection  
(3, 1) - Shared connection: 4  
(3, 9) - No shared connection  
(4, 1) - Shared connection: 3  
(4, 2) - No shared connection  
(4, 8) - Shared connection: 6  
(6, 9) - No shared connection  
(7, 8) - No shared connection  
(8, 4) - Shared connection: 6  
(8, 7) - No shared connection  
(9, 3) - No shared connection  
(9, 6) - No shared connection  

Count of triangles: [3]  
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 4>, <4, 1, 3>, <4, 8, 6>
