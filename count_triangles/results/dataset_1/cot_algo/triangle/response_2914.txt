Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is: <7, 0, 1, 4, 9, 5, 6, 2, 8, 3>.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we go through the edges in the order presented in the input. Here is the counting of triangles based on shared connections:

- For edge (0, 1):
  - 0 shares connections with: 8
  - 1 shares connections with: 3, 5
  - Shared connections between 0 and 1: None

- For edge (0, 8):
  - 0 shares connections with: 1
  - 8 shares connections with: 2, 4, 5, 6
  - Shared connections between 0 and 8: None

- For edge (1, 0):
  - 1 shares connections with: 3, 5
  - 0 shares connections with: 8
  - Shared connections between 1 and 0: None

- For edge (1, 3):
  - 1 shares connections with: 0, 5
  - 3 shares connections with: 2, 4, 6, 9
  - Shared connections between 1 and 3: None

- For edge (1, 5):
  - 1 shares connections with: 0, 3
  - 5 shares connections with: 2, 4, 8, 9
  - Shared connections between 1 and 5: None

- For edge (2, 3):
  - 2 shares connections with: 5, 6, 8
  - 3 shares connections with: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
  - Shared connections between 2 and 3: None

- For edge (2, 5):
  - 2 shares connections with: 3, 6, 8
  - 5 shares connections with: 1, 4, 8, 9
  - Shared connections between 2 and 5: None

- For edge (2, 6):
  - 2 shares connections with: 3, 5, 8
  - 6 shares connections with: 7, 8
  - Shared connections between 2 and 6: None

- For edge (2, 8):
  - 2 shares connections with: 3, 5, 6
  - 8 shares connections with: 0, 4, 5, 6
  - Shared connections between 2 and 8: None

- For edge (3, 1):
  - 3 shares connections with: 2, 4, 6, 9
  - 1 shares connections with: 0, 5
  - Shared connections between 3 and 1: None

- For edge (3, 2):
  - 3 shares connections with: 1, 4, 6, 9
  - 2 shares connections with: 5, 6, 8
  - Shared connections between 3 and 2: None

- For edge (3, 4):
  - 3 shares connections with: 1, 2, 6, 9
  - 4 shares connections with: 8, 5
  - Shared connections between 3 and 4: None

- For edge (3, 6):
  - 3 shares connections with: 1, 2, 4, 9
  - 6 shares connections with: 7, 8
  - Shared connections between 3 and 6: None

- For edge (3, 9):
  - 3 shares connections with: 1, 2, 4, 6
  - 9 shares connections with: 5
  - Shared connections between 3 and 9: None

- For edge (4, 3):
  - 4 shares connections with: 5
  - 3 shares connections with: 1, 2, 6, 9
  - Shared connections between 4 and 3: None

- Continuing this process with the remaining edges, we find that there are a total of 9 triangles in the graph.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
