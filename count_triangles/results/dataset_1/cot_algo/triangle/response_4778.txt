Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
2 < 5 < 9 < 1 < 3 < 5 < 8 < 5 < 7 < 5

Triangles found:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
