Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: degree 3
2: degree 1
3: degree 1
4: degree 1
5: degree 3
6: degree 3
7: degree 4
8: degree 4
9: degree 1

Now, starting with the vertices with the lowest degree, we will go through each edge to count the triangles:

(2, 0) - No triangles
(3, 0) - No triangles
(4, 9) - No triangles
(5, 6) - No triangles
(6, 5) - No triangles
(8, 5) - No triangles
(8, 6) - No triangles

Now, we move on to the vertices with the next higher degree:

(0, 2) - No triangles
(0, 3) - No triangles
(0, 7) - <0, 2, 7>
(7, 0) - No triangles
(7, 5) - <7, 5, 8>
(7, 8) - <7, 5, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 7> and <7, 5, 8>.
