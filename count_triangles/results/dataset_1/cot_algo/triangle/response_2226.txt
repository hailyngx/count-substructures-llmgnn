Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 5: 0 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 0: 6 connections
- Node 9: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Checking the edge (0, 1) → Node 1 has 4 connections (less than Node 0 with 6 connections). They share a connection with Node 9, forming a triangle <0, 1, 9>.
- Checking the edge (0, 6) → Node 6 has 2 connections (less than Node 0 with 6 connections). They share a connection with Node 3, forming a triangle <0, 6, 3>.
- Checking the edge (0, 7) → Node 7 has 5 connections (more than Node 0 with 6 connections). Not considered.
- Checking the edge (0, 9) → Node 9 has 6 connections (more than Node 0 with 6 connections). Not considered.
- Checking the edge (1, 4) → Node 4 has 2 connections (less than Node 1 with 4 connections). They share a connection with Node 9, forming a triangle <1, 4, 9>.
- Checking the edge (1, 5) → Node 5 has 0 connections (less than Node 1 with 4 connections). Not considered.
- Checking the edge (1, 7) → Node 7 has 5 connections (more than Node 1 with 4 connections). Not considered.
- Checking the edge (1, 9) → Node 9 has 6 connections (more than Node 1 with 4 connections). Not considered.
- Checking the edge (2, 7) → Node 7 has 5 connections (less than Node 2 with 1 connection). They share a connection with Node 0, forming a triangle <2, 7, 0>.
- Checking the edge (3, 6) → Node 6 has 2 connections (less than Node 3 with 2 connections). They share a connection with Node 0, forming a triangle <3, 6, 0>.
- Checking the edge (3, 8) → Node 8 has 3 connections (more than Node 3 with 2 connections). Not considered.
- Checking the edge (4, 9) → Node 9 has 6 connections (less than Node 4 with 2 connections). They share a connection with Node 1, forming a triangle <4, 9, 1>.
- Checking the edge (7, 8) → Node 8 has 3 connections (less than Node 7 with 5 connections). They share a connection with Node 3, forming a triangle <7, 8, 3>.
- Checking the edge (7, 9) → Node 9 has 6 connections (more than Node 7 with 5 connections). Not considered.
- Checking the edge (8, 9) → Node 9 has 6 connections (more than Node 8 with 3 connections). Not considered.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 5:
