Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degrees in increasing order: 
Vertices: 4, 5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 5, 3, 5, 7

Relabeling the vertices based on degree:
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 7 connections
