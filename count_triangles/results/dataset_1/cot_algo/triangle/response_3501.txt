Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections from least to most, the new labeling of the nodes is as follows: 

Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 4: 5 connections  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 6: 2 connections  
Node 7: 6 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 9: 2 connections  
Node 10: 1 connection  

Now, we examine each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections. 

After going through all the edges, we find that the total number of triangles present in the graph is 8, and the unique triangles are:

<0, 3, 7>  
<0, 4, 7>  
<0, 7, 8>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<3, 7, 8>  
<4, 5, 7>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
