Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method aims to count the number of triangles in a graph by sorting the vertices based on their degrees.

The degrees of the vertices in this graph are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 4

Sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order gives us the following order: 4-4-4-4-4-5-5-5-5-2.

Now, we consider the edges in this sorted order:
- (8, 5) - Node 8 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 5 (degree 4), move on.
- (4, 7) - Node 4 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 7 (degree 4), move on.
- (4, 3) - Node 4 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 3 (degree 5), forming a triangle <4, 3, 7>.
- (8, 9) - Node 8 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 9 (degree 4), move on.
- (5, 6) - Node 5 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 6 (degree 4), move on.
- (5, 0) - Node 5 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 0 (degree 4), move on.
- (5, 9) - Node 5 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 9 (degree 4), forming a triangle <5, 0, 9>.
- (0, 1) - Node 0 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 1 (degree 4), move on.
- (0, 6) - Node 0 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 6 (degree 4), move on.
- (0, 5) - Node 0 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 5 (degree 4), forming a triangle <0, 6, 5>.
- (6, 2) - Node 6 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 2 (degree 5), move on.
- (6, 1) - Node 6 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 1 (degree 4), move on.
- (6, 5) - Node 6 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 5 (degree 4), move on.
- (1, 3) - Node 1 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 3 (degree 5), forming a triangle <1, 6, 3>.
- (1, 7) - Node 1 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 7 (degree 4), move on.
- (1, 0) - Node 1 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 0 (degree 4), forming a triangle <1, 6, 0>.
- (7, 4) - Node 7 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 4 (degree 2), move on.
- (7, 3) - Node 7 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 3 (degree 5), move on.
- (7, 1) - Node 7 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 1 (degree 4), move on.
- (2, 9) - Node 2 (degree 5) has fewer connections than Node 9 (degree 4), forming a triangle <2, 3, 9>.
- (2, 7) - Node 2 (degree 5) has fewer connections than Node 7 (degree 4), move on.
- (2, 3) - Node 2 (degree 5) has fewer connections than Node 3 (degree 5), move on.
- (2, 0) - Node 2 (degree 5) has fewer connections than Node 0 (degree 4), move on.
