Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections (degree):
(1) 1
(0) 0, 6
(2) 9
(3) 5
(4) 7
(5) 4

2. Relabel the vertices:
1 -> 0
0, 6 -> 1
9 -> 2
5 -> 3
7 -> 4
4 -> 5

3. Process edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Checking (0, 9): Both have 1 connection. Skip.
Checking (1, 2): Both have 0 connections. Skip.
Checking (2, 1): 0 has 0 connections, 1 has 1 connection. Skip.
Checking (2, 4): 2 has 3 connections, 4 has 3 connections. Triangle found: <2, 4, 5>.
Checking (2, 9): 2 has 3 connections, 1 has 1 connection. Triangle found: <1, 2, 9>.
Checking (4, 2): Both have 3 connections. Skip.
Checking (4, 5): 4 has 3 connections, 5 has 3 connections. Triangle found: <4, 5, 7>.
Checking (4, 7): 4 has 3 connections, 7 has 4 connections. Triangle found: <4, 5, 7>.
Checking (5, 4): Both have 3 connections. Skip.
Checking (5, 7): 5 has 3 connections, 7 has 4 connections. Triangle found: <4, 5, 7>.
Checking (6, 7): Both have 4 connections. Skip.
Checking (7, 4): 7 has 4 connections, 5 has 3 connections. Triangle found: <4, 5, 7>.
Checking (7, 5): 7 has 4 connections, 3 has 1 connection. Triangle found: <3, 5, 7>.
Checking (7, 6): 7 has 4 connections, 4 has 3 connections. Triangle found: <4, 6, 7>.
Checking (9, 0): 2 has 3 connections, 0 has 1 connection. Triangle found: <0, 2, 9>.
Checking (9, 2): 2 has 3 connections, 1 has 0 connections. Triangle found: <1, 2, 9>.
