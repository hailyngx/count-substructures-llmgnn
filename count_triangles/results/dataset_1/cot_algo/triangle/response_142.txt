Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Vertices by the number of connections in ascending order: 
Vertices: 1 7 8 3 5 9 6 2 0 4

Edges: 
1 -> 5
7 -> 6
3 -> 9
5 -> 1, 8
9 -> 0, 3
6 -> 2, 7
2 -> 4, 6
0 -> 4, 9
4 -> 0, 2

Now, let's count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
