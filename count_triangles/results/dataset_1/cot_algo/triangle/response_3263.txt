Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new numbering is:
Node 0 has connections to nodes (5, 7) with 2 connections.
Node 1 has no connections.
Node 2 has connections to nodes (7, 8) with 2 connections.
Node 3 has connections to nodes (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) with 5 connections.
Node 4 has connections to node 6 with 1 connection.
Node 5 has connections to nodes (0, 3, 6, 9) with 4 connections.
Node 6 has connections to nodes (3, 4, 5) with 3 connections.
Node 7 has connections to nodes (0, 2, 3, 8) with 4 connections.
Node 8 has connections to nodes (2, 3, 7, 9) with 4 connections.
Node 9 has connections to nodes (3, 5, 8) with 3 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
