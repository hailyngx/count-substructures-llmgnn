Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Reordering the nodes based on their degrees: 

Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 3: 1 connection  
Node 8: 1 connection  
Node 5: 2 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 9: 5 connections   

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we observe the following triangles:
- <0, 2, 9>  
- <4, 6, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
