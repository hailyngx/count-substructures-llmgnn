Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees.

Node 3 has degree 1.
Nodes 5 and 9 have degree 2.
Nodes 1, 2, 8 have degree 3.
Nodes 6 and 7 have degree 4.
Node 0 has degree 7.
Node 4 has degree 8.

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph starting with the ones connected to the node with the lowest degree.

1. Edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.
2. Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (5, 4): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (6, 0): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (0, 1): Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>.
6. Edge (0, 2): Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
7. Edge (0, 4): No triangles formed since it would create duplicate triangles.
8. Edge (0, 6): No triangles formed since it would create duplicate triangles.
9. Edge (0, 7): No triangles formed since it would create duplicate triangles.
10. Edge (0, 8): No triangles formed since it would create duplicate triangles.

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [2].
