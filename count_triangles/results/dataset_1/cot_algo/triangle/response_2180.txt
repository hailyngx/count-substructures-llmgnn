Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices: 
0 (degree 4)
1 (degree 4)
2 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
4 (degree 3)
5 (degree 3)
6 (degree 5)
7 (degree 2)
8 (degree 5)
9 (degree 2)

Now, relabel the vertices:
0 -> 7
1 -> 7
2 -> 3
3 -> 3
4 -> 3
5 -> 3
6 -> 8
7 -> 1
8 -> 9
9 -> 1

Now, let's list the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(1, 7) - shared connections: (0, 6)
(1, 7) - shared connections: (6, 8)
(3, 4) - shared connections: (0, 6)
(3, 4) - shared connections: (6, 8)
(5, 3) - shared connections: (0, 2)
(5, 3) - shared connections: (0, 9)
(5, 3) - shared connections: (2, 9)
(5, 3) - shared connections: (2, 7)
(5, 3) - shared connections: (7, 9)

Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<6, 7, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<6, 7, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
