Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we get the following relabeling:
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 5
Node 7 has degree 5
Node 1 has degree 6
Node 6 has degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Checking each edge, we find the following triangles:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
