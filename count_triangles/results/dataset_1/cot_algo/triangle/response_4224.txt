Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Node 0 has 2 edges
- Node 1 has 3 edges
- Node 4 has 1 edge
- Node 5 has 1 edge
- Node 7 has 2 edges
- Node 8 has 2 edges
- Node 2 has 3 edges
- Node 6 has 4 edges
- Node 3 has 4 edges
- Node 9 has 4 edges

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes should be relabeled as follows:
Node 4 -> 0
Node 5 -> 1
Node 7 -> 2
Node 8 -> 3
Node 0 -> 4
Node 1 -> 5
Node 2 -> 6
Node 6 -> 7
Node 3 -> 8
Node 9 -> 9

The edges should now be:
(4, 6)
(4, 2)
(5, 3)
(5, 7)
(5, 1)
(6, 4)
(6, 0)
(6, 1)
(7, 5)
(7, 1)
(7, 9)
(7, 3)
(0, 6)
(1, 5)
(2, 6)
(3, 5)
(3, 8)
(3, 9)
(6, 0)
(6, 7)
(8, 3)
(8, 9)
(9, 3)
(9, 7)
(9, 8)

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method with the relabeled nodes, there are a total of 6 triangles: [6].
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
