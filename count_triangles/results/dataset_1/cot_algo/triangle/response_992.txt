Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 1, 8, 0, 4, 7, 6, 3, 2, 9, 5

Now, let's identify the triangles based on the shared connections:
1. (0, 2), (0, 8), (2, 8) - Triangle: <0, 2, 8>
2. (1, 7), (1, 9), (7, 9) - Triangle: <1, 7, 9>
3. (2, 0), (2, 5), (0, 5) - Triangle: <0, 2, 5>
4. (3, 6), (3, 7), (6, 7) - Triangle: <3, 6, 7>
5. (5, 2), (5, 9), (2, 9) - Triangle: <2, 5, 9>
6. (3, 9), (3, 7), (9, 7) - Triangle: <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [6].
