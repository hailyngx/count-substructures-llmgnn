Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to label the nodes based on their degrees.

Node 1: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5

Now, we will list the edges in decreasing order of the node labels:
(1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 1), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 9), (9, 8), (8, 5)

Let's count the triangles formed by the shared connections between nodes:
<3, 1, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 8>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
