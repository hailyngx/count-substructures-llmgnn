Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeled vertices: 

Node 1 has 0 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 2 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles: 

1. <1, 2, 6>
2. <2, 3, 6>
3. <3, 4, 8>
4. <3, 5, 6>
5. <4, 6, 8>
6. <4, 5, 8>
7. <5, 6, 8>
8. <5, 6, 9>
9. <6, 7, 2>
10. <6, 7, 4>
11. <6, 10, 9>
12. <6, 10, 7>
13. <6, 10, 8>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
