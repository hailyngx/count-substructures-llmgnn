Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertex 1 (degree 0): {1}
Vertex 2 (degree 1): {4}
Vertex 3 (degree 2): {1, 2}
Vertex 4 (degree 2): {1, 4}
Vertex 5 (degree 2): {1, 5}
Vertex 6 (degree 2): {1, 6}
Vertex 7 (degree 3): {1, 2, 3}
Vertex 8 (degree 3): {1, 2, 5}
Vertex 9 (degree 6): {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangle 1: <0, 6, 9>
Triangle 2: <0, 7, 9>
Triangle 3: <2, 3, 9>
Triangle 4: <2, 5, 8>
Triangle 5: <3, 7, 9>
Triangle 6: <6, 7, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [6].
