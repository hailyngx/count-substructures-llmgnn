Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 1: 0
Node 6: 1
Node 0: 1
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 1
Node 7: 2
Node 5: 3
Node 4: 3
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 4

Now, we will count the number of triangles by following the given method:
Count of triangles: [12]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 8, 5>
<6, 0, 7>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
