Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 6

Relabeling the nodes from least to most connected:
0 → 0
4 → 1
6 → 2
9 → 3
1 → 4
8 → 5
5 → 6
2 → 7
7 → 8
3 → 9

Now, we will check for triangles using the edges provided:
- (0, 1): No triangle
- (0, 2): No triangle
- (1, 8): No triangle
- (2, 3): Triangle <0, 2, 3>
- (3, 4): No triangle
- (3, 5): No triangle
- (3, 6): No triangle
- (3, 7): No triangle
- (7, 9): No triangle
- (8, 5): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 3>
