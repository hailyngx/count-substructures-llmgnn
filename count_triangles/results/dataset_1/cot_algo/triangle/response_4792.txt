Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labels are as follows: 

Node 7: 0 connections
Nodes 0, 4, 2, 9: 1 connection each
Nodes 1, 5, 6: 2 connections each
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

- Triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle <3, 5, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
