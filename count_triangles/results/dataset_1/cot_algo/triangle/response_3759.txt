Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 3: degree 1
Nodes 1, 8, 6: degree 2
Nodes 9, 2: degree 3
Nodes 4, 7: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 0: degree 6

Relabeling the nodes accordingly:

Node 3 (degree 1) -> Node 0
Nodes 1, 8, 6 (degree 2) -> Node 1, Node 2, Node 3
Nodes 9, 2 (degree 3) -> Node 4, Node 5
Nodes 4, 7 (degree 4) -> Node 6, Node 7
Node 5 (degree 5) -> Node 8
Node 0 (degree 6) -> Node 9

Now, going through each edge while considering the lower labeled vertex with fewer connections:

- Edge: (0, 1) - Check shared connections: 7
- Edge: (0, 4) - Check shared connections: 5
- Edge: (0, 5) - Check shared connections: 7, 4
- Edge: (0, 7) - Check shared connections: 2, 5
- Edge: (1, 2) - Check shared connections: None
- Edge: (2, 7) - Check shared connections: 0
- Edge: (2, 8) - Check shared connections: None
- Edge: (3, 6) - Check shared connections: None
- Edge: (4, 5) - Check shared connections: 0
- Edge: (4, 9) - Check shared connections: None
- Edge: (5, 7) - Check shared connections: 0
- Edge: (5, 9) - Check shared connections: None

Now, count the total number of triangles: 
There are three triangles: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 7, 5> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
