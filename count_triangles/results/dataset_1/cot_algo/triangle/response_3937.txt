Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for this graph is as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 3.
- Node 1 has degree 3.
- Node 3 has degree 2.
- Node 4 has degree 2.
- Node 8 has degree 3.
- Node 5 has degree 4.
- Node 7 has degree 3.
- Node 2 has degree 3.
- Node 6 has degree 3.
- Node 9 has degree 4.

The ordering of the nodes based on their degrees is: 3, 4, 1, 0, 8, 7, 2, 6, 9, 5.

Now, we will check edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to count triangles:
1. Edge (0, 1) -> Check shared connections: {5}. Triangle <0, 1, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 5) -> Check shared connections: {1, 8}. Triangle <0, 1, 8> and <0, 5, 8>.
3. Edge (0, 8) -> No additional triangles.
4. Edge (1, 0) -> No additional triangles.
5. Edge (1, 3) -> No additional triangles.
6. Edge (1, 5) -> Check shared connections: {0}. Triangle <1, 0, 5>.
7. Edge (2, 4) -> No additional triangles.
8. Edge (2, 6) -> No additional triangles.
9. Edge (2, 9) -> No additional triangles.
10. Edge (3, 1) -> No additional triangles.
11. Edge (3, 7) -> No additional triangles.
12. Edge (4, 2) -> No additional triangles.
13. Edge (4, 7) -> No additional triangles.
14. Edge (5, 0) -> No additional triangles.
15. Edge (5, 1) -> No additional triangles.
16. Edge (5, 8) -> Check shared connections: {0}. Triangle <5, 0, 8>.
17. Edge (5, 9) -> Check shared connections: {2, 6}. Triangle <5, 2, 6> and <5, 6, 9>.
18. Edge (6, 2) -> No additional triangles.
19. Edge (6, 8) -> No additional triangles.
20. Edge (6, 9) -> No additional triangles.
21. Edge (7, 3) -> No additional triangles.
22. Edge (7, 4) -> No additional triangles.
23. Edge (7, 9) -> No additional triangles.
24. Edge (8, 0) -> No additional triangles.
25. Edge (8, 5) -> No additional triangles.
26. Edge (8, 6) -> No additional triangles.
27. Edge (9, 2) -> No additional triangles.
28. Edge (9, 5) -> No additional triangles.
29. Edge (9, 6) -> No additional triangles.
30. Edge (9, 7) -> No additional triangles.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <5, 0, 8>, <5, 2, 6>, <5, 6, 9>.
