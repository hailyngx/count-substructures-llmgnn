Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows the steps below:

Vertices and their degrees:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 9: degree 5

Relabeling vertices:
- Vertex 7: degree 1 --> Vertex 0
- Vertex 2: degree 2 --> Vertex 1
- Vertex 3: degree 3 --> Vertex 2
- Vertex 4: degree 3 --> Vertex 3
- Vertex 0: degree 3 --> Vertex 4
- Vertex 5: degree 4 --> Vertex 5
- Vertex 1: degree 4 --> Vertex 6
- Vertex 9: degree 5 --> Vertex 7

Edges to consider based on the described rule (lower label has fewer connections):
(7, 9), (0, 2), (7, 9)

Triangles found:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <5, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
