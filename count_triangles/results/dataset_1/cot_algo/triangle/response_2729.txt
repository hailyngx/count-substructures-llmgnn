Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Node 1 has 1 connection.
- Node 3 has 2 connections.
- Nodes 8 and 5 have 3 connections.
- Nodes 2, 9, and 5 have 4 connections.
- Nodes 6 and 1 have 4 connections.

After relabeling the nodes:
Node 1 (1 connection) -> Node 1 (now the lowest labeled)
Node 3 (2 connections) -> Node 2
Nodes 8 and 5 (3 connections) -> Nodes 3 and 4
Nodes 2, 9, and 5 (4 connections) -> Nodes 5, 6, and 7
Nodes 6 and 1 (4 connections) -> Nodes 8 and 9 (highest labeled)

Now, we will check for triangles using the relabeled nodes:
- For edge (0, 2): Node 0 (1) < Node 2 (4), check shared connections - shared connection with Node 4 -> Triangle <0,4,2>
- For edge (0, 4): Node 0 (1) < Node 4 (3), check shared connections - no triangles formed.
- For edge (0, 5): Node 0 (1) < Node 5 (3), check shared connections - no triangles formed.
- For edge (1, 7): Node 1 (1) < Node 7 (4), check shared connections - no triangles formed.
- For edge (2, 6): Node 2 (2) < Node 6 (4), check shared connections - shared connection with Node 4 -> Triangle <2,4,6>
- For edge (3, 4): Node 3 (2) < Node 4 (3), check shared connections - no triangles formed.
- For edge (3, 7): Node 3 (2) < Node 7 (4), check shared connections - no triangles formed.
- For edge (4, 5): Node 4 (3) < Node 5 (3), check shared connections - shared connection with Node 9 -> Triangle <4,5,9>
- For edge (4, 6): Node 4 (3) < Node 6 (4), check shared connections - shared connection with Node 2 -> Triangle <4,6,2>
- For edge (4, 9): Node 4 (3) < Node 9 (4), check shared connections - shared connection with Node 5 -> Triangle <4,9,5>
- For edge (5, 0): Node 5 (3) < Node 0 (1), check shared connections - no triangles formed.
- For edge (5, 4): Node 5 (3) < Node 4 (3), check shared connections - shared connection with Node 9 -> Triangle <5,4,9>
- For edge (5, 9): Node 5 (3) < Node 9 (4), check shared connections - no triangles formed.
- For edge (6, 2): Node 6 (4) = Node 2 (2), edge rejected as Node 6 is the higher labeled node.
- For edge (6, 4): Node 6 (4) = Node 4 (3), edge rejected as Node 6 is the higher labeled node.
- For edge (6, 7): Node 6 (4) = Node 7 (4), edge rejected as Node 6 is the higher labeled node.
- For edge (6, 8): Node 6 (4) = Node 8 (4), edge rejected as Node 6 is the higher labeled node.
- For edge (7, 1): Node 7 (4) = Node 1 (1), edge rejected as Node 7 is the higher labeled node.
- For edge (7, 3): Node 7 (4) = Node 3 (2), edge rejected as Node 7 is the higher labeled node.
- For edge (7, 6): Node 7 (4) = Node 6 (4), edge rejected as Node 7 is the higher labeled node.
- For edge (7, 9): Node 7 (4) = Node 9 (4), edge rejected as Node 7 is the higher labeled node.
- For edge (8, 6): Node 8 (4) = Node 6 (4), edge rejected as Node 8 is the higher labeled node.
- For edge (9, 4): Node 9 (4) = Node 4 (3), edge rejected as Node 9 is the higher labeled node.
- For edge (9, 5): Node 9 (4) = Node 5 (3), edge rejected as Node 9 is the higher labeled node.
- For edge (9, 7): Node 9 (4) = Node 7 (4), edge rejected as Node 9 is the higher labeled node.
