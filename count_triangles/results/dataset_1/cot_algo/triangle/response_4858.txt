Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degrees from least to most:
Nodes: 1(1), 2(1), 6(1), 8(2), 5(2), 4(3), 1(3), 0(5), 9(5), 3(5)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
(0, 4): No triangles
(0, 5): No triangles
(0, 7): Triangle <0, 7, 5>
(0, 8): No triangles
(0, 9): Triangles <0, 9, 4> and <0, 9, 3>
(1, 3): No triangles
(2, 3): No triangles
(3, 1): No triangles
(3, 2): No triangles
(3, 7): Triangle <3, 7, 0>
(3, 9): Triangles <3, 9, 0> and <3, 9, 6>
(4, 0): No triangles
(4, 9): No triangles
(5, 0): No triangles
(5, 7): No triangles
(6, 9): No triangles
(7, 0): Triangle <7, 0, 5>
(7, 3): Triangle <7, 3, 9>
(7, 5): No triangles
(7, 8): No triangles
(8, 0): No triangles
(8, 7): No triangles
(9, 0): Triangle <9, 0, 4>
(9, 3): Triangle <9, 3, 7>
(9, 4): No triangles
(9, 6): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [7]
Triangles found: <0, 7, 5>, <0, 9, 4>, <0, 9, 3>, <3, 7, 0>, <3, 9, 0>, <3, 9, 6>, <9, 0, 4>
