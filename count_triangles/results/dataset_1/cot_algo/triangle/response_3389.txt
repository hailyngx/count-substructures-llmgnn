Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. After sorting the vertices in ascending order, we get the following new labels for the vertices: 

Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections

Now, we will go through each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections to count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3):
   - Shared connections with vertex 0: 4, 9
   - Shared connections with vertex 3: 1, 6
   - Triangle: <0, 3, 1>

2. Edge (0, 4):
   - Shared connections with vertex 0: 3, 9
   - Shared connections with vertex 4: 5, 6
   - Triangle: <0, 4, 5>

3. Edge (0, 9):
   - Shared connections with vertex 0: 3, 4
   - Shared connections with vertex 9: 1, 2, 5
   - Triangles: <0, 9, 1>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 5>

4. Edge (1, 3):
   - Shared connections with vertex 1: 9
   - Shared connections with vertex 3: 0, 6
   - Triangle: <1, 3, 0>

5. Edge (2, 5):
   - Shared connections with vertex 2: 8, 9
   - Shared connections with vertex 5: 4, 9, 7
   - Triangle: <2, 5, 9>

6. Edge (2, 8):
   - There are no triangles formed by this edge.

7. Edge (2, 9):
   - Shared connections with vertex 2: 5, 8
   - Shared connections with vertex 9: 0, 1, 5
   - Triangle: <2, 9, 0>, <2, 9, 1>, <2, 9, 5>

8. Edge (3, 6):
   - Shared connections with vertex 3: 0
   - Shared connections with vertex 6: 4, 7
   - There are no new triangles formed by this edge.

9. Edge (4, 5):
   - Shared connections with vertex 4: 0, 6
   - Shared connections with vertex 5: 2, 9, 7
   - Triangle: <4, 5, 0>

10. Edge (4, 6):
   - Shared connections with vertex 4: 0, 5
   - Shared connections with vertex 6: 3, 7
   - Triangle: <4, 6, 7>

11. Edge (5, 7):
   - Shared connections with vertex 5: 2, 4, 9
   - Shared connections with vertex 7: 6
   - There are no new triangles formed by this edge.

12. Edge (6, 7):
   - Shared connections with vertex 6: 3, 4
   - Shared connections with vertex 7: 5
   - Triangle: <6, 7, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is 9 inside brackets []:
