Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Vertices by their number of connections:
- Vertex 5: 0 connections
- Vertex 6: 0 connections
- Vertex 9: 1 connection
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections

Sorted vertices:
5, 6, 9, 0, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7

Triangles (sorted by vertex label):
[<0, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 8>] 

Total number of triangles: [2]
