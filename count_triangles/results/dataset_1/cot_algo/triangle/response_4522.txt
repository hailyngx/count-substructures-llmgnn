Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 0 - 2 connections
Vertex 1 - 2 connections
Vertex 2 - 1 connection
Vertex 3 - 4 connections
Vertex 4 - 2 connections
Vertex 5 - 1 connection
Vertex 6 - 1 connection
Vertex 7 - 3 connections
Vertex 8 - 3 connections
Vertex 9 - 1 connection

Relabeling the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 2 - 0 connections
Vertex 5 - 0 connections
Vertex 6 - 0 connections
Vertex 9 - 0 connections
Vertex 0 - 1 connection
Vertex 1 - 1 connection
Vertex 4 - 1 connection
Vertex 7 - 2 connections
Vertex 8 - 2 connections
Vertex 3 - 4 connections

Using the degree-based ordering, we go through the edges and count the triangles:

Count of triangles: [5]
Triangles: <0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <7, 8, 1>
