Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, we get the following list of vertices:
Vertices: 5, 9, 0, 1, 8, 4, 6, 7, 3, 2

Now, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph.
We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Looking at the edges that meet this criteria, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
