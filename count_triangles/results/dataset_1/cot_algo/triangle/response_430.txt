Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 has 1 connection.
Node 4 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 1 connection.
Node 9 has 2 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.
Node 6 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. For edge (0, 2):
   Node 0 (label 0) has connections with nodes 2 (label 2).

2. For edge (1, 3):
   Node 1 (label 1) has connections with nodes 3 (label 3).

3. For edge (1, 6):
   Node 1 (label 1) has connections with nodes 6 (label 6). Shared connection with node 3 (label 3) forms a triangle <1, 3, 6>.

4. For edge (1, 7):
   Node 1 (label 1) has connections with nodes 7 (label 7).

5. For edge (1, 8):
   Node 1 (label 1) has connections with nodes 8 (label 8).

6. For edge (2, 6):
   Node 2 (label 2) has connections with nodes 6 (label 6).

7. For edge (6, 3):
   Node 6 (label 6) has connections with nodes 3 (label 3).

8. For edge (6, 8):
   Node 6 (label 6) has connections with nodes 8 (label 8).

9. For edge (3, 9):
   Node 3 (label 3) has connections with nodes 9 (label 9).

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [1]. The unique triangle found is <1, 3, 6>.
