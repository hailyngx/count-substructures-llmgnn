Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be as follows:

Node 1 - Degree: 3
Node 2 - Degree: 4
Node 3 - Degree: 1
Node 4 - Degree: 2
Node 5 - Degree: 1
Node 6 - Degree: 5
Node 7 - Degree: 2
Node 8 - Degree: 2
Node 9 - Degree: 2

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes in order: 3, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 6

Now we will count the triangles:

<1, 2, 6>
<2, 4, 6> 
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 2>
<6, 9, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
