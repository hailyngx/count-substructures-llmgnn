Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, we will calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4

Now, we will reorder the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4

Next, we will analyze each edge based on the node with the lower label:
1. Edge (0, 1) - Node 0 has connections with Nodes 1, 5, and 7. Node 1 has connections with Nodes 0, 7, and 8. So, there is a triangle <0, 1, 8>.
2. Edge (0, 5) - Node 0 has connections with Nodes 1, 5, and 7. Node 5 has connections with Nodes 0, 2, and 8. So, there is a triangle <0, 5, 8>.
3. Edge (0, 7) - Node 0 has connections with Nodes 1, 5, and 7. Node 7 has connections with Nodes 0, 1, and 8. So, there is a triangle <0, 7, 1>.
4. Edge (1, 7) - Node 1 has connections with Nodes 0, 7, and 8. Node 7 has connections with Nodes 0, 1, and 8. So, there is a triangle <1, 7, 0>.
5. Edge (1, 8) - Node 1 has connections with Nodes 0, 7, and 8. Node 8 has connections with Nodes 1, 5, and 7. So, there is a triangle <1, 8, 0>.
6. Edge (5, 8) - Node 5 has connections with Nodes 0, 2, and 8. Node 8 has connections with Nodes 1, 5, and 7. So, there is a triangle <5, 8, 1>.
7. Edge (7, 8) - Node 7 has connections with Nodes 0, 1, and 8. Node 8 has connections with Nodes 1, 5, and 7. So, there is a triangle <7, 8, 1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 1>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 8, 0>, <5, 8, 1>, and <7, 8, 1>.
