Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections and then counting triangles based on the described rules. Here is the step-by-step calculation for the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
   Vertex 1 (degree 2) - Vertices connected: 6, 8
   Vertex 5 (degree 2) - Vertices connected: 2, 8
   Vertex 9 (degree 2) - Vertices connected: 2, 3
   Vertex 4 (degree 2) - Vertices connected: 2, 6
   Vertex 7 (degree 2) - Vertices connected: 0, 2
   Vertex 0 (degree 3) - Vertices connected: 6, 7, 8
   Vertex 3 (degree 3) - Vertices connected: 2, 8, 9
   Vertex 6 (degree 4) - Vertices connected: 0, 1, 4, 2
   Vertex 8 (degree 5) - Vertices connected: 0, 1, 3, 5, 2
   Vertex 2 (degree 6) - Vertices connected: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 8

2. Count the triangles:
   - Triangle <2, 4, 6> (shared connection 2): (2, 4), (2, 6), (4, 6)
   - Triangle <2, 5, 8> (shared connection 2): (2, 5), (2, 8), (5, 8)

3. Output the total number of triangles: [2]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2.
