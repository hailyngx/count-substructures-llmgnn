Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Nodes 5, 8, and 9 have degree 2
- Nodes 1 and 7 have degree 3
- Nodes 3 and 4 have degree 4
- Node 0 has degree 7
- Node 6 has degree 6

Based on the method, relabel the nodes as follows:
- Node 2 -> A
- Nodes 5, 8, and 9 -> B
- Nodes 1 and 7 -> C
- Nodes 3 and 4 -> D
- Node 0 -> E
- Node 6 -> F

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Edge (A, C) doesn't form a triangle with shared connections.
- Edge (A, B) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (A, D) forms a triangle <A, D, B>.
- Edge (A, C) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (C, D) forms a triangle <C, D, E>.
- Edge (C, D) forms a triangle <C, D, E>.
- Edge (D, E) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (D, E) forms a triangle <D, E, F>.

Count of triangles = 3
Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [3]. The unique triangles found are <A, D, B>, <C, D, E>, and <D, E, F>.
