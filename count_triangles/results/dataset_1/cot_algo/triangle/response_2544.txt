Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
0 -> 0 connections
1 -> 4 connections
5 -> 4 connections
8 -> 5 connections
9 -> 5 connections
7 -> 6 connections
6 -> 7 connections
3 -> 7 connections
2 -> 8 connections
4 -> 8 connections

Now, we will consider each edge in the graph and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

For edge (0, 1):
Vertex 0 has 0 connections.
Vertex 1 has 4 connections (3, 2, 3, 4).
There are 2 shared connections between 0 and 1: (3, 2) and (3, 4).
Therefore, there are 2 triangles formed with edge (0, 1): <0, 3, 2> and <0, 3, 4>.

For edge (1, 2):
Since vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 2, we proceed.
Vertex 2 has 8 connections. Vertex 1 has 4 connections (0, 3, 3, 5).
There are 2 shared connections between 1 and 2: (3, 3) and (3, 5).
Therefore, there are 2 triangles formed with edge (1, 2): <1, 3, 3> and <1, 3, 5>.

For the remaining edges, similar triangles can be counted as follows:

For edge (2, 4): 2 triangles
For edge (3, 4): 4 triangles
For edge (6, 7): 0 triangles
For edge (4, 7): 3 triangles
For edge (4, 9): 4 triangles

Total number of triangles: [17]
