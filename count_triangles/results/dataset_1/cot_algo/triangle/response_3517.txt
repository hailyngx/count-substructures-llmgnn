Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 0 - degree 2
Node 4 - degree 2
Node 7 - degree 2
Node 2 - degree 2
Node 8 - degree 3
Node 5 - degree 3
Node 6 - degree 3
Node 3 - degree 4
Node 9 - degree 4
Node 1 - degree 5

Now we will count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 6): Node 0 and Node 6 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 7): Node 0 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 2): Node 1 and Node 2 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 5): Node 1 and Node 5 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 8): Node 1 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 9): Node 1 and Node 9 do form a triangle with Node 5. Triangle: <1, 5, 9>
- Edge (3, 5): Node 3 and Node 5 do form a triangle with Node 1. Triangle: <1, 3, 5>
- Edge (3, 6): Node 3 and Node 6 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8): Node 3 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 9): Node 4 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 1): Already counted in (1, 5) edge.
- Edge (5, 3): Already counted in (3, 5) edge.
- Edge (6, 0): Already counted in (0, 6) edge.
- Edge (6, 3): Node 6 and Node 3 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 0): Already counted in (0, 7) edge.
- Edge (7, 9): Node 7 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 1): Already counted in (1, 8) edge.
- Edge (8, 3): Already counted in (3, 8) edge.
- Edge (9, 1): Already counted in (1, 9) edge.
- Edge (9, 4): Node 9 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7): Already counted in (7, 9) edge.

There are a total of [2] triangles in this graph.
