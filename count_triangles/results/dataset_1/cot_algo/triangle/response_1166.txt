Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their number of connections:

Node 7 -> Degree: 0
Nodes 1, 2, 5, 7 -> Degree: 1
Nodes 4, 6, 8 -> Degree: 2
Node 3 -> Degree: 8
Node 0, 9 -> Degree: 4

Now, we start checking the edges based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:

For edge (0, 3): Both vertices have 4 connections
For edge (0, 9): Both vertices have 4 connections
For edge (1, 3): Node 1 has 1 connection, Node 3 has 8 connections
For edge (2, 3): Node 2 has 1 connection, Node 3 has 8 connections
For edge (3, 0): Both vertices have 4 connections
For edge (3, 1): Both vertices have 4 connections
For edge (3, 2): Both vertices have 4 connections
For edge (3, 4): Node 3 has 8 connections, Node 4 has 2 connections, shared connection at node 4
For edge (3, 9): Both vertices have 4 connections
For edge (4, 3): Node 4 has 2 connections, Node 3 has 8 connections, shared connection at node 4
For edge (4, 5): Node 5 has 2 connections, Node 4 has 2 connections, shared connection at node 4
For edge (5, 4): Node 5 has 2 connections, Node 4 has 2 connections, shared connection at node 4
For edge (5, 6): Node 5 has 2 connections, Node 6 has 2 connections,
For edge (6, 5): Node 6 has 2 connections, Node 5 has 2 connections,
For edge (6, 9): Node 6 has 2 connections, Node 9 has 4 connections,
For edge (9, 0): Both vertices have 4 connections
For edge (9, 3): Both vertices have 4 connections
For edge (9, 6): Node 6 has 2 connections, Node 9 has 4 connections, shared connection at node 6

There are 2 triangles: <3, 4, 5> and <4, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
