Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. 

The sorted order of vertices is: <7, 1, 9, 6, 5, 8, 0, 4, 2, 3>.

Now, let's count the triangles formed by the edges:

For edge (0, 2):
    - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 3, 4, and 6.
    - Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 3 and 4.
    - Both vertices share connections with vertices 3 and 4, forming a triangle <0, 2, 3>.
    
For edge (0, 3):
    - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 2, 4, and 6.
    - Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8.
    - Both vertices share connections with vertices 2 and 4, forming a triangle <0, 3, 2> and <0, 3, 4>.
    
For edge (0, 4):
    - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 2, 3, and 6.
    - Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 1, 2, 3, and 6.
    - Both vertices share connections with vertices 2 and 3, forming a triangle <0, 4, 2> and <0, 4, 3>.
    
For the rest of the edges, there are no additional triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
