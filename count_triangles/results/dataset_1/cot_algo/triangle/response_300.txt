Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method to count the triangles in this graph involves sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Node 9 has degree 1  
Nodes 5 and 6 have degree 2  
Nodes 2 and 8 have degree 3  
Nodes 1 and 9 have degree 3  
Nodes 5 and 6 have degree 3  
Node 4 has degree 4  
Node 7 has degree 5  
Node 3 has degree 6  
Node 0 has degree 7  

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 9 (degree 1) -> Node 0  
Nodes 5 and 6 (degree 2) -> Nodes 1 and 2  
Nodes 2 and 8 (degree 3) -> Nodes 3 and 4  
Nodes 1 and 9 (degree 3) -> Nodes 5 and 6  
Nodes 5 and 6 (degree 3) -> Nodes 7 and 8  
Node 4 (degree 4) -> Node 9  
Node 7 (degree 5) -> Node 10  
Node 3 (degree 6) -> Node 11  
Node 0 (degree 7) -> Node 12  

Checking for triangles:

1. Triangles involving Node 0:
- (0, 9, 4)
- (0, 9, 7)
- (0, 4, 7)

2. Triangles involving Node 1:
- None

3. Triangles involving Node 2:
- None

4. Triangles involving Node 3:
- None

5. Triangles involving Node 4:
- (4, 1, 2)

6. Triangles involving Node 5:
- None

7. Triangles involving Node 6:
- None

8. Triangles involving Node 7:
- None

9. Triangles involving Node 8:
- None

10. Triangles involving Node 9:
- None

Adding up all the triangles, we get a total of 4 triangles.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 9, 4>, <0, 9, 7>, <4, 1, 2>.
