Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

- Vertex 7 is connected to 2 nodes
- Vertices 4 and 5 are connected to 3 nodes
- Vertices 1, 8, and 9 are connected to 4 nodes
- Vertices 2 and 3 are connected to 5 nodes
- Vertex 0 is connected to 6 nodes
- Finally, vertex 6 is connected to 7 nodes

Now, we will relabel the vertices in ascending order of connections:

- Vertex 7 (2 connections) is now vertex 0
- Vertices 4 and 5 (3 connections) are now vertices 1 and 2 respectively
- Vertices 1, 8, and 9 (4 connections) are now vertices 3, 4, and 5 respectively
- Vertices 2 and 3 (5 connections) are now vertices 6 and 7 respectively
- Vertex 0 (6 connections) is now vertex 8
- Finally, vertex 6 (7 connections) is now vertex 9

Next, we will count the number of triangles:

- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 1, 3>
- <8, 0, 2>
- <8, 0, 6>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <6, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
