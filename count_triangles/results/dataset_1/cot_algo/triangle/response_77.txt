Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will involve sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections

Relabeling the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 5 -> 0
Vertex 3 -> 1
Vertex 7 -> 2
Vertex 6 -> 3
Vertex 0 -> 4
Vertex 4 -> 5
Vertex 2 -> 6
Vertex 1 -> 7
Vertex 8 -> 8
Vertex 9 -> 9

Now, we will check for triangles among the edges:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 8, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles: [5]
