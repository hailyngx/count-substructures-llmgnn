Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Node 0 (degree 3) -> Node 0
Node 2 (degree 0) -> Node 1
Node 7 (degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 8 (degree 2) -> Node 3
Node 9 (degree 2) -> Node 4
Node 3 (degree 4) -> Node 5
Node 4 (degree 4) -> Node 6
Node 1 (degree 5) -> Node 7
Node 6 (degree 4) -> Node 8
Node 5 (degree 5) -> Node 9

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles:
1. (0, 3) shares a connection with (1, 5) forming triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. (0, 5) shares a connection with (1, 3) forming triangle <0, 1, 3>
3. (0, 6) shares a connection with (5, 9) forming triangle <0, 5, 9>
4. (1, 3) shares a connection with (0, 5) forming triangle <0, 1, 3>
5. (1, 4) shares a connection with (6, 7) forming triangle <1, 4, 6>
6. (1, 5) shares a connection with (0, 3) forming triangle <0, 1, 3>
7. (1, 8) shares a connection with (6, 7) forming triangle <1, 6, 7>
8. (3, 0) shares a connection with (5, 1) forming triangle <0, 1, 3>
9. (3, 1) shares a connection with (5, 0) forming triangle <0, 1, 3>
10. (4, 1) shares a connection with (7, 6) forming triangle <1, 4, 6>
11. (4, 7) shares a connection with (6, 8) forming triangle <4, 6, 7>
12. (4, 9) shares a connection with (5, 0) forming triangle <0, 4, 5>
13. (5, 0) shares a connection with (0, 3) forming triangle <0, 1, 3>
14. (5, 1) shares a connection with (0, 3) forming triangle <0, 1, 3>
15. (5, 6) shares a connection with (0, 0) forming triangle <0, 5, 9>
16. (5, 9) shares a connection with (0, 6) forming triangle <0, 5, 9>
17. (6, 0) shares a connection with (0, 5) forming triangle <0, 5, 9>
18. (6, 5) shares a connection with (8, 1) forming triangle <1, 6, 7>
19. (6, 7) shares a connection with (4, 9) forming triangle <4, 6, 7>
20. (6, 8) shares a connection with (1, 4) forming triangle <1, 4, 6>
21. (7, 4) shares a connection with (6, 8) forming triangle <4, 6, 7>
22. (7, 6) shares a connection with (4, 9) forming triangle <4, 6, 7>
23. (8, 1) shares a connection with (6, 5) forming triangle <1, 6, 7>
24. (8, 6) shares a connection with (1, 4) forming triangle <1, 4, 6>
25. (9, 4) shares a connection with (5, 0) forming triangle <0, 4, 5>
26. (9, 5) shares a connection with (0, 6) forming triangle <0, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
