Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection

We then relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 0 (2 connections) -> Vertex A
Vertex 1 (3 connections) -> Vertex B
Vertex 3 (2 connections) -> Vertex C
Vertex 4 (2 connections) -> Vertex D
Vertex 5 (1 connection) -> Vertex E
Vertex 6 (1 connection) -> Vertex F
Vertex 7 (1 connection) -> Vertex G
Vertex 8 (4 connections) -> Vertex H
Vertex 9 (1 connection) -> Vertex I

Now, we will go through each edge following the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. Check edge (0, 1): Vertex A and Vertex B share a connection with Vertex 4 forming a triangle.
2. Check edge (0, 4): This edge will not form a triangle.
3. Check edge (1, 3): This edge will not form a triangle.
4. Check edge (1, 4): This edge will not form a triangle.
5. Check edge (3, 8): This edge will not form a triangle.
6. Check edge (5, 8): This edge will not form a triangle.
7. Check edge (6, 8): This edge will not form a triangle.
8. Check edge (7, 9): This edge will not form a triangle.
9. Check edge (8, 3): This edge will not form a triangle.
10. Check edge (8, 5): This edge will not form a triangle.
11. Check edge (8, 6): This edge will not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1], and the unique triangle found is <0, 1, 4>.
