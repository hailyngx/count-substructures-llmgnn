Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 8 has 0 connections
- Node 1 has 1 connection
- Nodes 3, 9 have 2 connections
- Nodes 0, 7 have 3 connections
- Nodes 6, 2 have 4 connections
- Node 5 has 5 connections
- Node 4 has 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- Triangles <3, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 7> are formed. (Due to vertex 4)
- Triangles <2, 4, 6> are formed. (Due to vertex 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
