Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order and relabeling them, the graph looks as follows:
Nodes: 6, 1, 5, 3, 9, 8, 2, 7, 4, 0
Edges: (6, 7) (1, 3) (5, 7) (3, 4) (9, 8) (8, 0) (2, 7) (7, 4) (4, 0) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 9) (2, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (3, 1) (7, 5) (9, 0) (0, 4) (7, 2)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <6, 7, 5>
