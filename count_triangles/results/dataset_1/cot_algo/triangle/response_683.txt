Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the list of vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 4: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 3
Vertex 1: Degree 3
Vertex 7: Degree 3
Vertex 9: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 6
Vertex 6: Degree 7
Vertex 3: Degree 8

Next, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles by considering the lower labeled vertex in each edge. 

Count of triangles: [7] 

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
