Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new vertex order is: 1, 7, 0, 4, 9, 5, 2, 6, 8, 3.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 has 3 connections and vertex 5 has 4 connections. Since vertex 0 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections between 0 and 5 which are vertices 6 and 8. Thus, <0, 5, 6> and <0, 5, 8> form triangles.

2. Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 has 3 connections and vertex 6 has 5 connections. Again, vertex 0 has fewer connections and shares vertices 5 and 8 with 6. Therefore, <0, 6, 5> and <0, 6, 8> form triangles.

3. Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has 3 connections and vertex 8 has 5 connections. Vertex 0 shares vertices 5 and 6 with 8. Hence, <0, 8, 5> and <0, 8, 6> form triangles.

4. Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 has 2 connections and vertex 3 has 4 connections. Since vertex 1 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections which are vertex 7. Therefore, <1, 3, 7> form a triangle.

5. Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 has 4 connections and vertex 6 has 5 connections. Since vertex 2 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections which are vertices 8 and 9. Thus, <2, 6, 8> and <2, 6, 9> form triangles.

6. Edge (3, 1): Already counted in step 4.

7. Edge (3, 6): Already counted in step 5.

8. Edge (3, 8): Already counted in step 5.

9. Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 has 4 connections and vertex 9 has 3 connections. Since vertex 9 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections which are vertices 5 and 6. Therefore, <3, 9, 5> and <3, 9, 6> form triangles.

10. Edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 has 1 connection and vertex 6 has 5 connections. Since vertex 4 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections which is vertex 0. Hence, <4, 6, 0> forms a triangle.

11. Edge (5, 0): Already counted in step 1.

12. Edge (5, 8): Already counted in step 3.

13. Edge (5, 9): Already counted in step 9.

14. Edge (6, 0): Already counted in step 2.

15. Edge (6, 2): Already counted in step 5.

16. Edge (6, 3): Already counted in step 5.

17. Edge (6, 4): Already counted in step 10.

18. Edge (7, 1): Already counted in step 4.

19. Edge (8, 0): Already counted in step 3.

20. Edge (8, 2): Already counted in step 5.

21. Edge (8, 3): Already counted in step 5.

22. Edge (8, 5): Already counted in step 3.

23. Edge (9, 2): Already counted in step 5.

24. Edge (9, 3): Already counted in step 9.

25. Edge (9, 5): Already counted in step 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
