Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their connections:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 6 connections

Now, we will list the edges based on the order of the vertices with fewer connections:

(4, 2), (5, 8), (0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 8), (1, 6), (2, 7), (5, 9), (8, 1), (9, 5), (4, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 8), (2, 7), (7, 2), (5, 8), (9, 5), (5, 9), (8, 1)

Now, we will check for shared connections to identify triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 3, 6>
<5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
