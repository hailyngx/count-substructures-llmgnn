Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After labeling the vertices by their degree from least to most connections, the new ordering is: (3, 1, 2, 0, 7, 5, 6, 4, 8, 9).

Now, we can count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Checking each edge in the order given:
   - Edge (0, 4): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (0, 9): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (1, 5): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (1, 6): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (2, 6): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (2, 8): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (3, 5): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (3, 9): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (4, 0): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (4, 6): Triangle <0, 4, 6> found.
   - Edge (4, 7): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (4, 8): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (5, 1): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (5, 3): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (5, 8): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (6, 1): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (6, 2): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (6, 4): Triangle <0, 4, 6> found.
   - Edge (6, 7): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (7, 4): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (7, 6): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (7, 9): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (8, 2): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (8, 4): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (8, 5): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (8, 9): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (9, 0): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (9, 3): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (9, 7): No triangles can be formed.
   - Edge (9, 8): No triangles can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>.
