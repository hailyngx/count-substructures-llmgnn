Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 4: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found in the graph are:
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
