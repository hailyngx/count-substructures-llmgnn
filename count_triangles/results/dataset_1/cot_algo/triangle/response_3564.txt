Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by number of connections (degree):
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
