Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertex 3 has 2 connections.
Vertex 1, 4, 5, 7 have 0 connections.
Vertex 6 has 1 connection.
Vertex 2 has 3 connections.
Vertex 0, 8, 9 have 5 connections.

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their number of connections:
Vertex 3 (0 connections) -> Label 0
Vertex 1, 4, 5, 7 (0 connections) -> Label 1, 2, 3, 4
Vertex 6 (1 connection) -> Label 5
Vertex 2 (3 connections) -> Label 6
Vertex 0, 8, 9 (5 connections) -> Label 7, 8, 9

Now, we will list the edges and count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
(0, 1) -> We cannot form a triangle
(0, 2) -> We cannot form a triangle
(0, 6) -> We cannot form a triangle
(0, 7) -> We cannot form a triangle
(0, 9) -> We cannot form a triangle
(1, 4) -> We cannot form a triangle
(2, 0) -> We cannot form a triangle
(2, 8) -> We cannot form a triangle
(2, 9) -> We cannot form a triangle
(3, 4) -> We cannot form a triangle
(3, 9) -> We cannot form a triangle
(4, 3) -> We cannot form a triangle
(5, 8) -> We cannot form a triangle
(5, 9) -> We cannot form a triangle
(6, 0) -> We cannot form a triangle
(6, 8) -> We cannot form a triangle
(7, 0) -> We cannot form a triangle
(8, 2) -> We cannot form a triangle
(8, 5) -> We cannot form a triangle
(8, 6) -> We cannot form a triangle
(8, 9) -> We cannot form a triangle
(9, 0) -> We cannot form a triangle
(9, 2) -> We can form a triangle: <6, 9, 7>
(9, 3) -> We cannot form a triangle
(9, 5) -> We cannot form a triangle
(9, 8) -> We can form a triangle: <9, 7, 8>

There are [2] triangles in the given graph.
