Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices: 0(4), 1(2), 2(2), 3(2), 4(3), 5(3), 6(4), 7(1), 8(3), 9(3)

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees from least to most:
Vertices: 1(2), 2(2), 3(2), 7(1), 4(3), 5(3), 8(3), 9(3), 0(4), 6(4)

Next, we will identify the triangles based on the edges given:
Triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 8, 9>, <8, 5, 9>

Finally, we count the total number of triangles which is 7:
Total number of triangles: [7]
