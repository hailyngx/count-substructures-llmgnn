Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we relabel them as follows:
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 5> (Shared connection: 1)
- Triangle <0, 4, 7> (Shared connection: 4)
- Triangle <0, 8, 9> (Shared connection: 0, 8)
- Triangle <1, 3, 5> (Shared connection: 1, 3)
- Triangle <1, 3, 9> (Shared connection: 1, 3)
- Triangle <4, 5, 8> (Shared connection: 4, 5)
- Triangle <4, 7, 8> (Shared connection: 4, 8)
- Triangle <8, 9, 0> (Shared connection: 0, 8, 9)
- Triangle <8, 9, 2> (Shared connection: 8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
