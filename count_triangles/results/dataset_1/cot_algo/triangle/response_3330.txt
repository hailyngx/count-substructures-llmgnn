Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles using the given edges:

For the edge (0, 1): 
- Node 0 and Node 1 share the connection (0, 1), so we have a triangle <0, 1, 6>.

For the edge (0, 8):
- Both Node 0 and Node 8 have a connection to Node 4, so we have a triangle <0, 4, 8>.

For the edge (1, 2):
- Node 1 and Node 2 share the connections (1, 2) and (2, 1), so we have a triangle <1, 2, 6>.

For the edge (3, 4):
- Node 3 and Node 4 share the connections (3, 4) and (4, 3), so we have a triangle <3, 4, 6>.

For the edge (3, 5):
- Node 3 and Node 5 share the connection (3, 5), so we have a triangle <3, 5, 6>.

For the edge (4, 6): 
- Node 4 and Node 6 share the connection (4, 6), so we have a triangle <4, 6, 5>.

For the edge (5, 6): 
- Node 5 and Node 6 share the connections (5, 6) and (6, 5), so we have a triangle <5, 6, 1>.

For the edge (5, 7): 
- Node 5 and Node 7 share the connection (5, 7), so we have a triangle <5, 7, 2>.

For the edge (7, 8): 
- Node 7 and Node 8 share the connection (7, 8), so we have a triangle <7, 8, 0>.

Counting the total number of triangles, we have: [8 triangles]
