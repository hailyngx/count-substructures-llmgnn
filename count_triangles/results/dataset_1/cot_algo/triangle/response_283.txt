Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0 - Degree: 2
Node 1 - Degree: 2
Node 2 - Degree: 3
Node 3 - Degree: 2
Node 4 - Degree: 2
Node 5 - Degree: 3
Node 6 - Degree: 1
Node 7 - Degree: 2
Node 8 - Degree: 2
Node 9 - Degree: 8

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method on the provided edges, we can count the triangles. 

Triangles:
