Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
0 (degree 1)
1 (degree 1)
6 (degree 2)
8 (degree 1)
3 (degree 2)
5 (degree 2)
7 (degree 2)
9 (degree 4)
2 (degree 4)
4 (degree 6)

Using the given edges and the ordering above, we count the triangles:

Triangles:
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
