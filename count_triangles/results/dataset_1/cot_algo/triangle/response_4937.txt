Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: <1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2>.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Counting the number of triangles formed by the shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
