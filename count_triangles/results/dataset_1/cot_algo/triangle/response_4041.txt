Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 1
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 1
Node 9 has degree 1
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 6

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
Node 5 (degree 1) -> relabeled as Node 0
Node 8 (degree 1) -> relabeled as Node 1
Node 9 (degree 1) -> relabeled as Node 2
Node 0 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 3
Node 4 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 4
Node 7 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 5
Node 2 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Node 6
Node 1 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Node 7
Node 6 (degree 6) -> relabeled as Node 8

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2): 
   Node 0 is connected to Nodes 2, 6
   Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 4, 7
   Shared connection forms a triangle: <0, 2, 6>

2. Edge (0, 6):
   Node 0 is connected to Nodes 2, 6
   Node 6 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
   Shared connection forms a triangle: <0, 6, 2>

3. Edge (1, 4):
   Node 1 is connected to Nodes 4, 6, 7
   Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 2
   No triangles formed.

4. Edge (1, 6):
   Node 1 is connected to Nodes 4, 6, 7
   Node 6 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
   Shared connection forms a triangle: <1, 6, 0>

5. Edge (1, 7):
   Node 1 is connected to Nodes 4, 6, 7
   Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1, 2
   No triangles formed.

6. Edge (2, 4):
   Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 4, 7
   Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 2
   No triangles formed.

7. Edge (2, 7):
   Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 4, 7
   Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1, 2
   Shared connection forms a triangle: <2, 7, 1>

8. Edge (4, 1):
   Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 2
   Node 1 is connected to Nodes 4, 6, 7
   No triangles formed.

9. Edge (4, 2):
   Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 2
   Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 4, 7
   No triangles formed.

10. Edge (5, 6):
   Node 5 is connected to Node 6
   No triangles formed.

11. Edge (6, 0):
   Node 6 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
   Node 0 is connected to Nodes 2, 6
   Shared connection forms a triangle: <6, 0, 2>

12. Edge (6, 1):
   Node 6 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
   Node 1 is connected to Nodes 4, 6, 7
   Shared connection forms a triangle: <6, 1, 4>

13. Edge (6, 5):
   Node 6 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
   Node 5 is connected to Node 6
   No triangles formed.

14. Edge (6, 8):
   Node 6 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
   Node 8 is connected to Node 6
   No triangles formed.

15. Edge (6, 9):
   Node 6 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
   Node 9 is connected to Node 6
   No triangles formed.

16. Edge (7, 1):
   Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1, 2
   Node 1 is connected to Nodes 4, 6, 7
   No triangles formed.

17. Edge (7, 2):
   Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1, 2
   Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 4, 7
   Shared connection forms a triangle: <7, 2, 0>

18. Edge (8, 6):
   Node 8 is connected to Node 6
   No triangles formed.

19. Edge (9, 6):
   Node 9 is connected to Node 6
   No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
