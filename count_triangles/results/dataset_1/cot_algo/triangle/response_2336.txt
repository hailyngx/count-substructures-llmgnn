Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree:
0 (degree 3), 8 (degree 1), 1 (degree 2), 5 (degree 2), 6 (degree 2), 3 (degree 3), 2 (degree 3), 7 (degree 4), 4 (degree 4), 9 (degree 5)

Edges for processing based on lower degree vertex:
(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (7, 9)

Triangles found: 
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [2]
