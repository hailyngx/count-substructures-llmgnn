Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are:

Node 6: Degree 0
Node 1: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now analyze the edges to count the number of triangles. The triangles found [in brackets] and unique triangles listed inside <> are as follows:

[30]

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
