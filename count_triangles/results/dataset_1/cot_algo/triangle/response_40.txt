Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 6 connections

Based on the given edges and the relabeled vertices, we can determine the triangles and count them.

The total number of triangles is [15].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <6, 7, 9>.
