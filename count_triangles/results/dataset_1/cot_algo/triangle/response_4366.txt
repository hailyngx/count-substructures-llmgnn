Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 3: degree 0
Node 7: degree 0
Nodes 0, 2, 5: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Nodes 4, 8: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 9: degree 6

Calculating the triangles:
- For edge (0, 1), both nodes 0 and 1 have degree 2 and 3 respectively, so we proceed. They share a connection with node 8, forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.
- For edge (0, 8), node 0 has degree 2 and node 8 has degree 4, so we proceed. They share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <0, 8, 9>.
- For edge (1, 9), both nodes have degree 3 and 6 respectively, so we proceed. They share a connection with node 4, forming a triangle <1, 9, 4>.
- For edge (2, 6), both nodes have degree 2 and 4 respectively, so we proceed. They do not share any common connection.
- For edge (4, 6), both nodes have degree 4, so we proceed. They share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <4, 6, 9>.
- For edge (4, 9), both nodes have degree 4 and 6 respectively, so we proceed. They share a connection with nodes 1 and 8, forming triangles <4, 9, 1> and <4, 9, 8>.
- For edge (5, 9), both nodes have degree 2 and 6 respectively, so we proceed. They share a connection with node 4, forming a triangle <5, 9, 4>.
- For edge (6, 2), both nodes have degree 4 and 2 respectively, so we proceed. They do not share any common connection.
- For edge (6, 4), both nodes have degree 4, so we proceed. They share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <6, 4, 9>.
- For edge (8, 0), node 8 has degree 4 and node 0 has degree 2, so we proceed. They share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <8, 0, 9>.
- For edge (8, 9), both nodes have degree 4 and 6 respectively, so we proceed. They share a connection with nodes 1 and 4, forming triangles <8, 9, 1> and <8, 9, 4>.
- For edge (9, 1), both nodes have degree 6 and 3 respectively, so we proceed. They share a connection with node 4, forming a triangle <9, 1, 4>.
- For edge (9, 5), both nodes have degree 6 and 2 respectively, so we proceed. They share a connection with node 4, forming a triangle <9, 5, 4>.
- For edge (9, 9), we don't proceed as it's a self-loop.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
