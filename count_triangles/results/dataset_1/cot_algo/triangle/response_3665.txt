Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

Sorting vertices by their number of connections:
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 5

Based on the sorted list, the edges that will result in counting triangles are:
(0, 1, 7)
(0, 2, 4)
(0, 2, 8)
(0, 4, 6)
(0, 4, 8)
(1, 7, 2)
(2, 7, 3)
(2, 7, 5)
(4, 0, 6)
(4, 6, 8)
(5, 3, 7)
(5, 7, 9)
(6, 2, 8)

Counting the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [13]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 2>
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 7, 5>
<4, 0, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 2, 8>
