Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labeling of the vertices is:  

Vertices: 2, 3, 6, 9, 0, 7, 5, 1, 8, 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we will analyze each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

- Edge (0, 1): Shared connection with vertex 4
- Edge (0, 7): No triangle formed
- Edge (1, 4): Shared connections with vertices 5 and 8
- Edge (1, 5): Shared connection with vertex 4
- Edge (1, 8): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 6): No triangle formed
- Edge (3, 4): No triangle formed
- Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed
- Edge (4, 8): Shared connection with vertex 1
- Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed
- Edge (7, 0): No triangle formed
- Edge (7, 8): Shared connection with vertex 9
- Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 9): No triangle formed

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<7, 8, 9>
