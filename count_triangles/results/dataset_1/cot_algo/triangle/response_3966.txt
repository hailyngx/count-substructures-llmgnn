Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Order the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Re-label the nodes based on degree:
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 4: 0 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections

Identify the triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<8, 3, 7>

Count the total number of triangles: [6]
