Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 

Vertex 0 has degree 2  
Vertex 9 has degree 2  
Vertex 8 has degree 1  
Vertex 6 has degree 2  
Vertex 3 has degree 4  
Vertex 5 has degree 4  
Vertex 2 has degree 4  
Vertex 7 has degree 5  
Vertex 1 has degree 6  
Vertex 4 has degree 6  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:  
- Checking edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:  
  - Triangle <1, 3, 9>  
  - Triangle <1, 4, 7>
  - Triangle <1, 5, 7>  
  - Triangle <2, 4, 7>  
  - Triangle <2, 5, 7>  
  - Triangle <4, 5, 7>  

Total number of triangles: [6]
