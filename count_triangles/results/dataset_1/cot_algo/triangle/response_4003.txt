Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices and their respective degrees in ascending order:

Vertices: 
1. 3 (vertex 3)
2. 5 (vertex 5)
3. 7 (vertex 7)
4. 9 (vertex 9)
5. 1 (vertex 1)
6. 2 (vertex 2)
7. 8 (vertex 8)
8. 0 (vertex 0)
9. 4 (vertex 4)
10. 6 (vertex 6)

Now, we will examine each edge based on the degree of its vertices:

(0, 6) - Proceed since vertex 0 has degree 1 and vertex 6 has degree 2. Shared connection: None.
(0, 9) - Proceed since vertex 0 has degree 1 and vertex 9 has degree 1. Shared connection: None.
(1, 2) - Proceed since vertex 1 has degree 2 and vertex 2 has degree 2. Shared connection: None.
(1, 7) - Proceed since vertex 1 has degree 2 and vertex 7 has degree 1. Shared connection: None.
(2, 5) - Proceed since vertex 2 has degree 2 and vertex 5 has degree 1. Shared connection: None.
(3, 4) - Proceed since vertex 3 has degree 1 and vertex 4 has degree 2. Shared connection: None.
(4, 6) - Proceed since vertex 4 has degree 2 and vertex 6 has degree 2. Shared connection: None.
(6, 0) - Proceed since vertex 6 has degree 2 and vertex 0 has degree 1. Shared connection: None.
(7, 1) - Proceed since vertex 7 has degree 1 and vertex 1 has degree 2. Shared connection: None.

Now, let's count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: 
<0, 6, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
