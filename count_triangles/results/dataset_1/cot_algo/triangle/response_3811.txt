Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The graph vertices with their respective connections are as follows:
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 9: 1 connection
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 0: 6 connections

Now, we will check each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

For edge (0, 1):
Node 1 has 1 connection, which is less than Node 0's 6 connections. No triangles are formed.

For edge (0, 2):
Node 2 has 2 connections, which is less than Node 0's 6 connections. No triangles are formed.

For edge (0, 3):
Node 3 has 5 connections, which is less than Node 0's 6 connections. A triangle is formed: <0, 3, 7>.

For edge (0, 6):
Node 6 has 3 connections, which is less than Node 0's 6 connections. A triangle is formed: <0, 6, 3>.

For edge (0, 7):
Node 7 has 4 connections, which is less than Node 0's 6 connections. Two triangles are formed: <0, 7, 3> and <0, 7, 6>.

For edge (1, 0):
Node 0 has 6 connections, which is more than Node 1's 1 connection. No triangles are formed.

For edge (2, 0):
Node 0 has 6 connections, which is more than Node 2's 2 connections. No triangles are formed.

For the remaining edges, we have already counted the triangles as we traverse the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
