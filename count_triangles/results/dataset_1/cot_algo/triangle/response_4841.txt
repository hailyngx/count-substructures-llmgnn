Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: 1 (degree 1), 8 (degree 1), 5 (degree 2), 1 (degree 2), 4 (degree 3), 3 (degree 3), 2 (degree 4), 0 (degree 4), 7 (degree 5), 9 (degree 5)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Edges to consider: (1, 8), (1, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 2), (3, 0), (2, 0), (0, 7), (0, 9)

Calculating triangles:
- (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
- (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- (4, 3) forms a triangle: <3, 4, 5>.
- (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
- (3, 5) forms a triangle: <3, 4, 5>.
- (3, 2) does not form a triangle.
- (3, 0) does not form a triangle.
- (2, 0) does not form a triangle.
- (0, 7) forms a triangle: <0, 6, 7>.
- (0, 9) does not form a triangle. 

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <3, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 7>.
