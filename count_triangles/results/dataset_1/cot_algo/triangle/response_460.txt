Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in finding the total number of triangles in the given graph.

Sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have:
Vertices: 4, 1, 9, 8, 5, 2, 3, 6, 0, 7

Based on the method, we proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Checking the edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<7, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 3>

Counting the total number of triangles gives us [3].
