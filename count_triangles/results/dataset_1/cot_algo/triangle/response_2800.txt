Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the nodes based on their number of connections:

0: Degree 3
1: Degree 3
3: Degree 3
5: Degree 2
8: Degree 3
9: Degree 3
4: Degree 4
7: Degree 3
6: Degree 4
2: Degree 7

Next, starting from the node with the least connections, we count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 3]
<0, 2, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 7>
