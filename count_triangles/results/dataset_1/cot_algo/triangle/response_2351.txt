Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 has 3 connections, Node 2 has 1 connection, Nodes 1, 5, 9 have 2 connections each, and Nodes 3, 4, 6, 8, and 7 have 4, 3, 4, 4, and 6 connections respectively.

Now, by following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

List of triangles found: 
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 7>
<3, 1, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 1>
<7, 8, 4>
<7, 9, 1>
<7, 9, 8>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
