Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 1 has degree 2.
Node 7 has degree 1.
Node 3 has degree 1.
Node 2 has degree 1.
Node 8 has degree 2.
Node 4 has degree 3.
Node 5 has degree 3.
Node 9 has degree 4.
Node 0 has degree 7.
Node 6 has degree 5.

Therefore, the ordered vertices are: 1, 7, 3, 2, 8, 4, 5, 9, 0, 6.

By following the instructions given, we look at each edge using the ordered vertices: 
- Edge (1, 5) is not valid as 1 < 5 but 1 has more connections than 5.
- Edge (7, 4) is valid and forms triangle <4, 6, 7>.
- Edge (3, 0) is not valid as 3 < 0 but 3 has more connections than 0.
- Edge (2, 0) is valid and forms triangle <0, 2, 6>.
- Edge (8, 4) is valid and forms triangle <0, 4, 8>.
- Edge (4, 6) is valid and forms triangle <4, 6, 0>.
- Edge (5, 6) is valid and forms triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- Edge (9, 1) is valid and forms triangle <1, 5, 9>.
- Edge (0, 6) is valid and forms triangle <0, 4, 6>.
- Edge (6, 9) is valid and forms triangle <4, 6, 9>.
- Edge (6, 5) is valid and forms triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- Edge (0, 8) is valid and forms triangle <0, 4, 8>.
- Edge (6, 5) is valid and forms triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- Edge (5, 0) is valid and forms triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- Edge (0, 9) is valid and forms triangle <0, 4, 6>.
- Edge (4, 8) is valid and forms triangle <0, 4, 8>.
- Edge (9, 1) is valid and forms triangle <1, 5, 9>.
- Edge (0, 3) is not valid as 0 < 3 but 0 has more connections than 3.
- Edge (0, 2) is valid and forms triangle <0, 2, 6>.
- Edge (1, 9) is valid and forms triangle <1, 5, 9>.
- Edge (5, 1) is valid and forms triangle <0, 1, 5>.

The total number of triangles is [11].
