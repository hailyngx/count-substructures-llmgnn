Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted vertices are: 8, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 3, 4, 0, 7.

After relabeling the vertices accordingly, the edges are filtered as follows:
(0, 2) - 0 has 4 connections, 2 has 6 connections
(0, 3) - 0 has 4 connections, 3 has 3 connections
(0, 4) - 0 has 4 connections, 4 has 5 connections
(0, 7) - 0 has 4 connections, 7 has 6 connections
(1, 2) - 1 has 1 connection, 2 has 6 connections
(1, 5) - 1 has 1 connection, 5 has 2 connections
(2, 3) - 2 has 6 connections, 3 has 3 connections
(2, 4) - 2 has 6 connections, 4 has 5 connections
(2, 6) - 2 has 6 connections, 6 has 2 connections
(2, 9) - 2 has 6 connections, 9 has 4 connections
(3, 9) - 3 has 3 connections, 9 has 4 connections
(4, 7) - 4 has 5 connections, 7 has 6 connections

Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections between the vertices in each edge:
[Total number of triangles: 4]
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 7>
