Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by the number of connections they have, from least to most. By relabeling the vertices accordingly, we assign the following new labels to the nodes: 

Node 0 with 4 edges,
Node 1 with 2 edges,
Node 3 with 1 edge,
Node 8 with 2 edges,
Node 9 with 3 edges,
Node 4 with 2 edges,
Node 6 with 3 edges,
Node 5 with 4 edges,
Node 7 with 4 edges,
Node 2 with 5 edges.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can identify and count the number of triangles in the graph. The total number of triangles is 6, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, and <2, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the output should be: [6]
