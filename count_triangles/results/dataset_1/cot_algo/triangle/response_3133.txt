Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, first, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
6: 1 connection
7: 1 connection
3: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
8: 5 connections
2: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start by examining the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Examining the edges:

(0, 2) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 2, 5>
(1, 8) does not form a triangle
(1, 9) does not form a triangle
(2, 0) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 2, 5>
(2, 5) does not form a triangle
(2, 8) does not form a triangle
(3, 4) does not form a triangle
(3, 5) does not form a triangle
(3, 7) does not form a triangle
(4, 3) does not form a triangle
(4, 8) does not form a triangle
(4, 9) does not form a triangle
(5, 2) does not form a triangle
(5, 3) does not form a triangle
(6, 8) does not form a triangle
(7, 3) does not form a triangle
(8, 1) does not form a triangle
(8, 2) does not form a triangle
(8, 4) does not form a triangle
(8, 6) does not form a triangle
(9, 1) does not form a triangle
(9, 4) does not form a triangle

By following these steps, we find that there are 2 triangles in the given graph: <0, 2, 5>, and the total number of triangles is [2].
