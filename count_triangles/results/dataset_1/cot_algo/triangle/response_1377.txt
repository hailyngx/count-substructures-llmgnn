Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we have the following labels for each node:
(1) Node 2 (degree 2)
(2) Node 5 (degree 2)
(3) Node 8 (degree 2)
(4) Node 1 (degree 2)
(5) Node 3 (degree 3)
(6) Node 4 (degree 3)
(7) Node 7 (degree 3)
(8) Node 0 (degree 5)
(9) Node 6 (degree 6)
(10) Node 9 (degree 6)

Analyzing the edges based on the ordering of nodes, we consider only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. (2, 5) forms a triangle with 6
2. (2, 6) forms a triangle with 0
3. (2, 8) does not form a triangle
4. (5, 9) forms a triangle with 6
5. (1, 6) forms a triangle with 0
6. (3, 7) forms a triangle with 0
7. (4, 6) forms a triangle with 0
8. (0, 3) forms a triangle with 6
9. (0, 4) forms a triangle with 6
10. (0, 6) does not form a triangle
11. (0, 7) forms a triangle with 4
12. (0, 9) does not form a triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 0>, <5, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 0>, <3, 7, 0>, <4, 6, 0>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 7>.
