Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To begin, we list the vertices and their respective degrees:

Node 1: 2  
Node 2: 2  
Node 5: 3  
Node 6: 6   
Node 7: 3  
Node 8: 5  
Node 9: 1  

Next, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees and then proceed with finding triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 9: 1  
Node 2: 2  
Node 1: 2  
Node 5: 3  
Node 7: 3  
Node 8: 5  
Node 6: 6  

Now, we will go through each edge and look for triangles:

1. Edge (1, 8): No triangles found.  
2. Edge (2, 6): No triangles found.  
3. Edge (5, 7): No triangles found.  
4. Edge (5, 8): No triangles found.  
5. Edge (6, 2): No triangles found.  
6. Edge (6, 7): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>.  
7. Edge (6, 8): Triangles found: <1, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>.  
8. Edge (6, 9): No triangles found.  
9. Edge (7, 5): No triangles found.  
10. Edge (7, 6): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>.  
11. Edge (8, 1): No triangles found.  
12. Edge (8, 5): No triangles found.  
13. Edge (8, 6): Triangles found: <1, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>.  
14. Edge (9, 6): No triangles found.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3], and the unique triangles found are <1, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, and <5, 6, 8>.
