Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
By analyzing the given graph and sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we have the following labels:

Node 0 - Degree 2
Node 1 - Degree 2
Node 3 - Degree 2
Node 6 - Degree 1
Node 7 - Degree 2
Node 9 - Degree 2
Node 5 - Degree 3
Node 8 - Degree 3
Node 4 - Degree 4
Node 2 - Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. (0, 2): Shared connections with 5, forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
2. (0, 5): No triangles formed.
3. (1, 3): No triangles formed.
4. (1, 8): No triangles formed.
5. (2, 0): Shared connections with 5, forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
6. (2, 4): Shared connections with 7, forming a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
7. (2, 7): Shared connections with 4, 9, forming a triangle <2, 7, 9>.
8. (2, 9): Shared connections with 7, forming a triangle <2, 7, 9>.
9. (3, 1): No triangles formed.
10. (3, 4): No triangles formed.
11. (4, 2): Shared connections with 7, forming a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
12. (4, 3): No triangles formed.
13. (4, 7): Shared connections with 2, forming a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
14. (5, 0): Shared connections with 2, forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
15. (5, 6): No triangles formed.
16. (5, 8): Shared connections with 1, 9, forming a triangle <1, 5, 8>.
17. (6, 5): No triangles formed.
18. (7, 2): Shared connections with 4, 9, forming a triangle <2, 7, 9>.
19. (7, 4): Shared connections with 2, forming a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
20. (8, 1): No triangles formed.
21. (8, 5): Shared connections with 1, 9, forming a triangle <1, 5, 8>.
22. (8, 9): Shared connections with 2, 5, 7, forming a triangle <2, 8, 9>.
23. (9, 2): Shared connections with 7, forming a triangle <2, 7, 9>.
24. (9, 8): Shared connections with 2, 5, 7, forming a triangle <2, 8, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [7]
Triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 9>
