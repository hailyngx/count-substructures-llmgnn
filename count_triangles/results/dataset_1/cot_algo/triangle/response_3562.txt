Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 1 connection.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.

Sorting the nodes by their number of connections:
Nodes in ascending order: 3, 5, 0, 2, 8, 9, 1, 4, 6, 7

From the given edges, we only consider the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Check (0, 1): Node 0 < Node 1
- Check (0, 4): Node 0 < Node 4
- Check (0, 4): Node 0 < Node 4
- Check (1, 6): Node 1 < Node 6
- Check (2, 4): Node 2 < Node 4
- Check (4, 7): Node 4 < Node 7
- Check (7, 8): Node 7 < Node 8
- Check (3, 9): Node 3 < Node 9
- Check (6, 7): Node 6 < Node 7
- Check (6, 7): Node 6 < Node 7
- Check (7, 9): Node 7 < Node 9

Counting the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
