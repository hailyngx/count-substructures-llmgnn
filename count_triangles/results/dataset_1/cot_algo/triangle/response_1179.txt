Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on the number of connections:

Node 4: 0 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3): Node 0 and Node 3 share connections with Node 5, forming triangle <0, 3, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 8): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 and Node 5 share connections with Node 3, forming triangle <1, 5, 3>.
5. Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (2, 1): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 3): Node 2 and Node 3 share connections with Node 1, forming triangle <2, 3, 1>.
8. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 and Node 6 share connections with Node 1, forming triangle <2, 6, 1>.
9. Edge (2, 7): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (3, 0): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (3, 2): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (3, 5): Counted earlier.
13. Edge (3, 7): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (4, 9): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (5, 1): Counted earlier.
16. Edge (5, 3): Counted earlier.
17. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (5, 9): Node 5 and Node 9 share connections with Node 4, forming triangle <5, 9, 4>.
19. Edge (6, 1): Counted earlier.
20. Edge (6, 2): Counted earlier.
21. Edge (7, 2): No triangle formed.
22. Edge (7, 3): No triangle formed.
23. Edge (8, 0): No triangle formed.
24. Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed.
25. Edge (9, 4): No triangle formed.
26. Edge (9, 5): Counted earlier.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <0, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 3>, <5, 9, 4>
