Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by the number of connections they have. Then, the vertices are relabeled accordingly. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 8: 0 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections

Now, we will check for triangles by examining each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles found is [8].

Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 9, 8>
