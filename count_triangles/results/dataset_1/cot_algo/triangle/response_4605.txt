Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 4, 3, 9, 8, 6, 5, 1, 7, 0, 2.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Counting the triangles formed:
1. Edge (4, 8): No triangles since both vertices have more than 3 connections.
2. Edge (3, 1): No triangles since both vertices have the same number of connections.
3. Edge (9, 1): No triangles since both vertices have the same number of connections.
4. Edge (8, 4): No triangles since both vertices have more than 3 connections.
5. Edge (6, 2): Triangle <2, 6, 8>.
6. Edge (5, 1): Triangle <1, 5, 8>.
7. Edge (1, 0): Triangle <0, 1, 5>.
8. Edge (7, 0): No triangles since vertex 0 has more than 3 connections.
9. Edge (0, 1): Triangle <0, 1, 5>.

Total number of triangles: [3]
