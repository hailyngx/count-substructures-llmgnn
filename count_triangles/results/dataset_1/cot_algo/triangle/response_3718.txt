Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 8: Degree 6
Node 3: Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the graph, we find:
Total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 5>, <5, 6, 9>
