Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling of vertices is as follows:
- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 1 has degree 3
- Vertex 4 has degree 2
- Vertex 5 has degree 2
- Vertex 2 has degree 4
- Vertex 9 has degree 4
- Vertex 3 has degree 5
- Vertex 6 has degree 4
- Vertex 8 has degree 4
- Vertex 7 has degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering the edges, we find the total number of triangles to be [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
