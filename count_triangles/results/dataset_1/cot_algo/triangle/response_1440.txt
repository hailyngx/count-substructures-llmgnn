Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each node has:  
Node 0: 2 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 4: 6 connections  
Node 5: 6 connections  
Node 6: 5 connections  
Node 7: 2 connections  
Node 8: 5 connections  
Node 9: 4 connections  

Now, let's re-label the nodes based on the number of connections (from least to most):  
Node 0 -> 0 connections  
Node 3 -> 2 connections  
Node 7 -> 2 connections  
Node 8 -> 2 connections  
Node 2 -> 3 connections  
Node 9 -> 4 connections  
Node 1 -> 4 connections  
Node 6 -> 5 connections  
Node 4 -> 6 connections  
Node 5 -> 6 connections  

Now, we will go through each edge and only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will count the triangles formed by shared connections.

Triangles:
<1, 4, 5>  
<1, 5, 6>  
<1, 5, 9>  
<4, 5, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
