Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices ordered by their degrees are: 
Vertex 3 (degree 2) <br>
Vertex 5 (degree 1) <br>
Vertex 7 (degree 1) <br>
Vertex 5 (degree 1) <br>
Vertex 7 (degree 1) <br>
Vertex 1 (degree 2) <br>
Vertex 2 (degree 2) <br>
Vertex 6 (degree 2) <br>
Vertex 8 (degree 4) <br>
Vertex 0 (degree 6) <br>

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles as follows:

For edge (3, 8):
- Vertex 3 and vertex 8 share a connection with vertex 0 forming a triangle.
- Triangle: <0, 3, 8>

For edge (3, 9):
- Vertex 3 and vertex 9 share a connection with vertex 0 forming a triangle.
- Triangle: <0, 3, 9>

For edge (8, 3):
- This triangle is already counted when considering edge (3, 8).

Adding these unique triangles, the total number of triangles is [2].
