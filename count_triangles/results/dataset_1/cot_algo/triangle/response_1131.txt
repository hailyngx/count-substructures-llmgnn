Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most. The sorted order of vertices in this case is: 5, 8, 2, 9, 4, 1, 3, 6, 7, 0.

Now, let's count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections between vertices.

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<6, 7, 9>
