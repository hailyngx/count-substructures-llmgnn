Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method aims to count the number of triangles in a graph efficiently. Let's follow the steps to count the triangles in the given graph:

First, we will sort the vertices by the number of connections:
- Node 9: Degree 1
- Nodes 2, 4, 7: Degree 2
- Nodes 1, 6, 8: Degree 4
- Nodes 3, 5: Degree 5

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on the degree:
- Node 9: Label 1
- Nodes 2, 4, 7: Label 2
- Nodes 1, 6, 8: Label 3
- Nodes 3, 5: Label 4

Next, we will check each edge, making sure to only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Edge (1, 3): Both 1 and 3 have the same label, but we proceed since 1 < 3
Common Neighbors: 7
Triangles: <1, 3, 7>

Edge (1, 6): Both 1 and 6 have the same label, but we proceed since 1 < 6
Common Neighbors: None

Edge (1, 7): Proceed since 1 < 7
Common Neighbors: 3, 6
Triangles: <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 7>

Edge (1, 8): Proceed since 1 < 8
Common Neighbors: 3
Triangles: <1, 3, 7>

Edge (2, 3): Proceed since 2 < 3
Common Neighbors: None

Edge (2, 5): Proceed since 2 < 5
Common Neighbors: None

Edge (2, 8): Proceed since 2 < 8
Common Neighbors: None

Edge (3, 5): Proceed since 3 < 5
Common Neighbors: None

Edge (3, 7): Proceed since 3 < 7
Common Neighbors: 1
Triangles: <1, 3, 7>

Edge (3, 8): Proceed since 3 < 8
Common Neighbors: 1
Triangles: <1, 3, 7>

Edge (4, 5): Proceed since 4 < 5
Common Neighbors: None

Edge (4, 6): Proceed since 4 < 6
Common Neighbors: None

Edge (4, 8): Proceed since 4 < 8
Common Neighbors: None

Edge (5, 6): Proceed since 5 < 6
Common Neighbors: None

Edge (5, 9): Proceed since 5 < 9
Common Neighbors: None

Finally, we count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:
Total triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 7>
