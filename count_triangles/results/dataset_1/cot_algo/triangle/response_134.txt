Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are:
0, 2, 9, 7, 8, 1, 4, 5, 6, 3.

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 6):
    Node 0 and node 6 have no common connections.

2. Edge (2, 1):
    Node 2 and node 1 have no common connections.

3. Edge (9, 5):
    Node 9 and node 5 have no common connections.

4. Edge (7, 1):
    Node 7 and node 1 have no common connections.

5. Edge (8, 3):
    Node 8 and node 3 have no common connections.

6. Edge (1, 4):
    Node 1 and node 4 have no common connections.

7. Edge (4, 5):
    Node 4 and node 5 have a common connection with node 6, forming a triangle: <4, 5, 6>.

8. Edge (4, 6):
    Node 4 and node 6 have no common connections.

9. Edge (6, 0):
    Node 6 and node 0 have no common connections.

10. Edge (6, 3):
    Node 6 and node 3 have common connections with nodes 4 and 5, forming two triangles: <3, 6, 4> and <3, 6, 5>.

11. Edge (6, 4):
    Node 6 and node 4 have no common connections.

12. Edge (6, 7):
    Node 6 and node 7 have no common connections.

13. Edge (6, 8):
    Node 6 and node 8 have common connections with node 4, forming a triangle: <4, 6, 8>.

14. Edge (3, 5):
    Node 3 and node 5 have common connections with nodes 4 and 6, forming two triangles: <3, 5, 4> and <3, 5, 6>.

15. Edge (3, 6):
    Node 3 and node 6 have common connections with nodes 4 and 5, forming two triangles: <3, 6, 4> and <3, 6, 5>.

16. Edge (3, 7):
    Node 3 and node 7 have no common connections.

17. Edge (3, 8):
    Node 3 and node 8 have no common connections.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is 7, and they are:
<4, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 5>, <4, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 5, 6>. 

Therefore, the answer is [7].
