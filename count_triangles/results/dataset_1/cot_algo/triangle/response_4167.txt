Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are: 
Vertex 5 (degree 1)
Vertex 9 (degree 2)
Vertex 1 (degree 2)
Vertex 3 (degree 2)
Vertex 0 (degree 2)
Vertex 8 (degree 2)
Vertex 6 (degree 3)
Vertex 4 (degree 3)
Vertex 7 (degree 5)
Vertex 2 (degree 5)

Now we will check each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 4) - Both vertices have 2 connections. No triangles are formed.
2. Edge (0, 6) - Vertex 0 has 2 connections and Vertex 6 has 3 connections. No triangles are formed.
3. Edge (1, 2) - Both vertices have 2 connections. No triangles are formed.
4. Edge (1, 6) - Both vertices have 2 connections. No triangles are formed.
5. Edge (2, 1) - Vertex 2 has 5 connections and Vertex 1 has 2 connections. No triangles are formed.
6. Edge (2, 4) - Vertex 2 has 5 connections and Vertex 4 has 3 connections. A triangle is formed with Vertex 0.
7. Edge (2, 7) - Vertex 2 has 5 connections and Vertex 7 has 5 connections. A triangle is formed with Vertex 4.
8. Edge (2, 9) - Vertex 2 has 5 connections and Vertex 9 has 2 connections. No triangles are formed.
9. Edge (3, 7) - Both vertices have 2 connections. No triangles are formed.
10. Edge (4, 0) - Vertex 4 has 3 connections and Vertex 0 has 2 connections. No triangles are formed.
11. Edge (4, 2) - Vertex 4 has 3 connections and Vertex 2 has 5 connections. A triangle is formed with Vertex 0.
12. Edge (4, 9) - Vertex 4 has 3 connections and Vertex 9 has 2 connections. No triangles are formed.
13. Edge (5, 8) - Both vertices have 1 connection. No triangles are formed.
14. Edge (6, 0) - Vertex 6 has 3 connections and Vertex 0 has 2 connections. No triangles are formed.
15. Edge (6, 1) - Vertex 6 has 3 connections and Vertex 1 has 2 connections. No triangles are formed.
16. Edge (6, 7) - Vertex 6 has 3 connections and Vertex 7 has 5 connections. A triangle is formed with Vertex 0.
17. Edge (7, 2) - Vertex 7 has 5 connections and Vertex 2 has 5 connections. A triangle is formed with Vertex 4.
18. Edge (7, 3) - Both vertices have 2 connections. No triangles are formed.
19. Edge (7, 6) - Vertex 7 has 5 connections and Vertex 6 has 3 connections. A triangle is formed with Vertex 0.
20. Edge (7, 8) - Vertex 7 has 5 connections and Vertex 8 has 2 connections. A triangle is formed with Vertex 5.
21. Edge (8, 5) - Vertex 8 has 2 connections and Vertex 5 has 1 connection. No triangles are formed.
22. Edge (8, 7) - Vertex 8 has 2 connections and Vertex 7 has 5 connections. A triangle is formed with Vertex 5.
23. Edge (9, 2) - Vertex 9 has 2 connections and Vertex 2 has 5 connections. No triangles are formed.
24. Edge (9, 4) - Vertex 9 has 2 connections and Vertex 4 has 3 connections. No triangles are formed.

The total number of triangles in the graph is 4.
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <5, 7, 8>.
