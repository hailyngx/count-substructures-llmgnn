Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph after sorting the vertices based on their degree is as follows:
Node 3 (Degree 2): Connected to nodes 4, 7
Node 5 (Degree 2): Connected to nodes 6, 7
Node 9 (Degree 2): Connected to nodes 1, 8
Node 0 (Degree 3): Connected to nodes 1, 2
Node 2 (Degree 3): Connected to nodes 0, 8
Node 1 (Degree 4): Connected to nodes 0, 7, 9
Node 8 (Degree 4): Connected to nodes 2, 6, 9
Node 4 (Degree 4): Connected to nodes 3, 7
Node 6 (Degree 4): Connected to nodes 5, 7, 8
Node 7 (Degree 6): Connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6

After following the degree-based ordering method and considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
