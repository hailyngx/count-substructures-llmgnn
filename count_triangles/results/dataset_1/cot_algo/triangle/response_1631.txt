Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:  
Node 4 (Degree: 2)  
Node 7 (Degree: 2)  
Node 9 (Degree: 2)  
Node 5 (Degree: 3)  
Node 3 (Degree: 3)  
Node 7 (Degree: 3)  
Node 6 (Degree: 4)  
Node 0 (Degree: 6)  
Node 1 (Degree: 6)  
Node 2 (Degree: 6)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

Triangles:  
[10]  

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles are:  
<0, 1, 2>  
<0, 1, 6>  
<0, 1, 8>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 2, 6>  
<0, 3, 9>  
<1, 2, 6>  
<1, 6, 8>  
<2, 5, 6>  
<6, 7, 8>
