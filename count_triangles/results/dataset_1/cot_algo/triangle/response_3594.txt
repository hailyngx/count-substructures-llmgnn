Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, the graph is as follows:
    
Vertices: 
0 (degree 3)
1 (degree 4)
2 (degree 4)
3 (degree 4)
4 (degree 2)
5 (degree 3)
6 (degree 4)
7 (degree 1)
8 (degree 2)
9 (degree 4)

Edges to consider based on the Degree-Based Ordering:
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6)
