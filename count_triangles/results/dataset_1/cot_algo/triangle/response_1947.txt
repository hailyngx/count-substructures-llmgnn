Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Node 4: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5

Next, we will label the nodes based on their sorted degrees:

Node 4: Degree 2 (Label 0)
Node 7: Degree 2 (Label 1)
Node 0: Degree 4 (Label 2)
Node 5: Degree 4 (Label 3)
Node 6: Degree 4 (Label 4)
Node 8: Degree 4 (Label 5)
Node 9: Degree 4 (Label 6)
Node 1: Degree 5 (Label 7)
Node 2: Degree 5 (Label 8)
Node 3: Degree 5 (Label 9)

Now, applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles:

<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 8>
<5, 8, 2>
<5, 8, 1>
<6, 9, 0>

Total number of triangles: [10]
