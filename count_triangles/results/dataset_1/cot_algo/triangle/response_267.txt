Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the degrees of each node:

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Next, we relabel the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
Node 3 (Degree 1) -> Node 0
Node 2 (Degree 2) -> Node 1
Node 9 (Degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 6 (Degree 3) -> Node 3
Node 7 (Degree 3) -> Node 4
Node 1 (Degree 3) -> Node 5
Node 4 (Degree 5) -> Node 6
Node 0 (Degree 4) -> Node 7

Now, we can iterate through the edges and count the triangles:
Triangles:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
