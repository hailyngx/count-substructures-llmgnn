Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
By using the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices in ascending order of degree:
1. Vertex 4 (degree 0)
2. Vertex 1 (degree 2)
3. Vertex 6 (degree 2)
4. Vertex 7 (degree 2)
5. Vertex 5 (degree 3)
6. Vertex 2 (degree 4)
7. Vertex 9 (degree 4)
8. Vertex 3 (degree 4)
9. Vertex 8 (degree 6)
10. Vertex 0 (degree 6)

Now, let's identify the triangles:

- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle 4: <0, 7, 1>
- Triangle 5: <0, 9, 3>
- Triangle 6: <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle 7: <3, 6, 8>
- Triangle 8: <3, 9, 8>

Total number of triangles: [8]
