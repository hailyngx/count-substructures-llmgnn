Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 1 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 6 connections.
Node 7 has 7 connections.
Node 9 has 7 connections.

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[12] 

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
