Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabelling them accordingly, the new edge list becomes:
(1, 0) (3, 0) (5, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (8, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (5, 6) (8, 6) (9, 5) (6, 5) (1, 5) (4, 5) (1, 6) (4, 6) (8, 6) (0, 7) (9, 5) (5, 9)

So, the triangles in the given graph are:
[7]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 5, 1>
