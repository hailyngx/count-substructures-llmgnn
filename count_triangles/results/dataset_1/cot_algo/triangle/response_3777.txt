Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
0 (degree 4), 3 (degree 2), 4 (degree 1), 8 (degree 2), 5 (degree 3), 9 (degree 3), 1 (degree 4), 7 (degree 4), 2 (degree 5), 6 (degree 6).

Checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Edge (0, 1):
- Shared connections with 0: 2, 9
- Formed triangle: <0, 1, 2>

Edge (0, 2):
- Shared connections with 0: 1, 7
- Formed triangle: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 1>

Edge (0, 7):
- Shared connections with 0: 2
- Formed triangle: <0, 2, 7>

Edge (0, 9):
- Shared connections with 0: 1
- Formed triangle: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 9, 7>

Edge (3, 5):
- Shared connections with 3: 6
- Formed triangle: <3, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [6]
