Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

- Node 0 has degree 2.
- Node 1 has degree 3.
- Node 3 has degree 2.
- Node 6 has degree 2.
- Node 8 has degree 2.
- Node 7 has degree 3.
- Node 4 has degree 3.
- Node 2 has degree 2.
- Node 5 has degree 5.
- Node 9 has degree 5.

Next, we will relabel the vertices from 0 to 9 based on their degrees:

- Node 0 (degree 2) -> 0
- Node 2 (degree 2) -> 1
- Node 3 (degree 2) -> 2
- Node 6 (degree 2) -> 3
- Node 8 (degree 2) -> 4
- Node 1 (degree 3) -> 5
- Node 7 (degree 3) -> 6
- Node 4 (degree 3) -> 7
- Node 5 (degree 5) -> 8
- Node 9 (degree 5) -> 9

Now, we will go through each edge according to the lower labeled vertex to count the triangles:

1. (0, 2): Check shared connections [0, 2]: None
2. (0, 4): Check shared connections [0, 4]: None
3. (1, 4): Check shared connections [5, 7]: None
4. (1, 5): Check shared connections [5, 8]: None
5. (1, 6): Check shared connections [5, 3]: None
6. (2, 9): Check shared connections [1, 9]: None
7. (3, 7): Check shared connections [2, 6]: None
8. (3, 9): Check shared connections [2, 9]: 2
9. (4, 5): Check shared connections [7, 8]: None
10. (6, 9): Check shared connections [3, 9]: None
11. (5, 7): Check shared connections [8, 6]: None
12. (5, 8): Check shared connections [8, 6]: None
13. (5, 9): Check shared connections [8, 9]: None
14. (7, 8): Check shared connections [6, 8]: None
15. (9, 6): Check shared connections [9, 3]: None

There are 1 triangle identified from the (3, 9) edge. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1]. 
The unique triangle found is <2, 3, 9>.
