Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes by their degree, we have: <7, 0, 1, 7, 9, 6, 3, 5, 5, 9>
Calculating the triangles:
- Looking at edge (0, 6): nodes 0 and 6 share a connection with node 8 forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
- Looking at edge (0, 8): nodes 0 and 8 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (1, 5): nodes 1 and 5 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (2, 3): nodes 2 and 3 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (2, 4): nodes 2 and 4 share a connection with node 6 forming a triangle <2, 4, 6>.
- Looking at edge (2, 6): nodes 2 and 6 share a connection with node 8 forming a triangle <2, 6, 8>.
- Looking at edge (3, 2): nodes 2 and 3 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (3, 4): nodes 3 and 4 share a connection with node 9 forming a triangle <3, 4, 9>.
- Looking at edge (3, 9): nodes 3 and 9 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (4, 2): nodes 2 and 4 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (4, 3): nodes 3 and 4 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (4, 8): nodes 4 and 8 share a connection with node 6 forming a triangle <4, 8, 6>.
- Looking at edge (4, 9): nodes 4 and 9 share a connection with node 8 forming a triangle <4, 9, 8>.
- Looking at edge (5, 1): nodes 1 and 5 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (5, 8): nodes 5 and 8 share a connection with node 9 forming a triangle <5, 8, 9>.
- Looking at edge (5, 9): nodes 5 and 9 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (6, 0): nodes 0 and 6 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (6, 2): nodes 2 and 6 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (6, 8): nodes 6 and 8 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (7, 9): nodes 7 and 9 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (8, 0): nodes 0 and 8 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (8, 4): nodes 4 and 8 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (8, 5): nodes 5 and 8 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (8, 6): nodes 6 and 8 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (8, 9): nodes 8 and 9 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (9, 3): nodes 3 and 9 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (9, 4): nodes 4 and 9 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (9, 5): nodes 5 and 9 do not form a triangle.
- Looking at edge (9, 7): nodes 7 and 9 do not form a triangle.

The total number of triangles is [3].
