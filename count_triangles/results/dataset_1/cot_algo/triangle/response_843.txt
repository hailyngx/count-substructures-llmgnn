Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.
Node 7 has 5 connections.
Node 0 has 6 connections.
Node 4 has 6 connections.
Node 6 has 6 connections.
Node 8 has 6 connections.
Node 2 has 7 connections.
Node 2 has 7 connections.
Node 4 has 7 connections.
Node 6 has 7 connections.
Node 8 has 7 connections.
Node 2 has 8 connections.
Node 4 has 8 connections.
Node 6 has 8 connections.
Node 8 has 8 connections.
Node 2 has 9 connections.
Node 8 has 9 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles:

1. Node 0 (4 connections) connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7, but no triangles.
2. Node 2 (7 connections) connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8:
   - Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4. Triangle: <0, 2, 4>.
   - Forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 8. Triangle: <2, 4, 8>.
3. Node 4 also forms the same triangles as node 2, so we don't count them again.
4. Node 6 (6 connections) connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9, but no triangles.
5. Node 1 (4 connections) connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8, but no triangles.
6. Node 8 (9 connections) connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7:
   - Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 4. Triangle: <2, 4, 8>.
   - Forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 7. Triangle: <4, 7, 8>.
   - Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 7. Triangle: <2, 7, 8>.

Total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
