Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following labels for the vertices:

0 -> degree 3  
1 -> degree 1  
2 -> degree 2  
3 -> degree 3  
4 -> degree 3  
5 -> degree 1  
6 -> degree 5  
7 -> degree 2  
8 -> degree 2  
9 -> degree 4  

Following the degree-based ordering, we can now proceed to count the number of triangles by looking at each edge and checking for shared connections.

There are 5 triangles in this graph:  
[5]

The unique triangles are:  
<0, 4, 6>  
<0, 6, 9>  
<2, 6, 7>  
<3, 6, 9>  
<6, 8, 9>
