Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling of vertices is as follows:
- Node 0 (Degree 3)
- Node 2 (Degree 2)
- Node 8 (Degree 2)
- Node 5 (Degree 4)
- Node 4 (Degree 4)
- Node 7 (Degree 4)
- Node 6 (Degree 5)
- Node 1 (Degree 4)
- Node 3 (Degree 5)
- Node 9 (Degree 7)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph.

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 7, 5>
- <0, 9, 5>
- <0, 9, 7>
- <4, 1, 6>
- <4, 6, 5>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <3, 6, 9>
