Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
0(1) 1(2) 3(2) 6(2) 4(0) 9(0) 10(0) 5(4) 8(4) 2(7)

Triangles found: <2, 0, 1> <2, 0, 3> <2, 1, 3> <2, 5, 7> <2, 5, 8> <5, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
