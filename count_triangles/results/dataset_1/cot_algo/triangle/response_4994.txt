Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 8: 1 connection  
Node 4: 2 connections  
Node 7: 2 connections  
Node 3: 3 connections  
Node 9: 3 connections  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 6: 4 connections  
Node 5: 5 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start examining the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections.  
Counting the triangles formed based on the shared connections gives us:  

Triangles:  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 4, 5>  
<2, 5, 9>  
<2, 6, 5>  
<1, 6, 5>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
