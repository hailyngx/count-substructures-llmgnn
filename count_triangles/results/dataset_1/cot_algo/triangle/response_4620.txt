Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new numbering will be:
Node 1 (1 connection): 1
Node 4 (1 connection): 2
Node 6 (1 connection): 3
Node 8 (1 connection): 4
Node 0 (2 connections): 5
Node 1 (2 connections): 6
Node 3 (2 connections): 7
Node 4 (2 connections): 8
Node 7 (3 connections): 9
Node 9 (3 connections): 10

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following:
[Total number of triangles: 3]
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
