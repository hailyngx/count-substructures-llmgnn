Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labelings are: 
- Node 5 with degree 1
- Nodes 7 and 8 with degree 2
- Nodes 4 and 6 with degree 3
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 9 with degree 4

Following the degree-based ordering method and considering only the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we can count the triangles.

Triangles:
[5 triangles total]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 6>
