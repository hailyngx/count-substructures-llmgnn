Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices in order of their degrees:

Vertices:
0 (degree 2)
4 (degree 2)
9 (degree 1)
5 (degree 2)
2 (degree 3)
8 (degree 2)
7 (degree 4)
6 (degree 4)
1 (degree 5)

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 -> 0
4 -> 1
9 -> 2
5 -> 3
2 -> 4
8 -> 5
7 -> 6
6 -> 7
1 -> 8

Now, we will go through the edges following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Check shared connections -> none
2. Edge (0, 4): Check shared connections -> none
3. Edge (1, 6): Check shared connections -> Triangle formed: <1, 6, 4>
4. Edge (1, 7): Check shared connections -> Triangle formed: <1, 7, 6>
5. Edge (1, 9): Check shared connections -> none
6. Edge (2, 7): Proceed to check shared connections as 2 has fewer connections
7. Edge (2, 8): Proceed to check shared connections as 2 has fewer connections
8. Edge (4, 7): Check shared connections -> Triangle formed: <4, 7, 1>
9. Edge (5, 6): Check shared connections -> none
10. Edge (6, 8): Check shared connections -> none

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 1>
