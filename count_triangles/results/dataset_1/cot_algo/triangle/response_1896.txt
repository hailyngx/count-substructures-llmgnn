Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 1 (degree 0): 1
Vertex 6 (degree 0): 6
Vertex 7 (degree 0): 7
Vertex 3 (degree 1): 3
Vertex 1 (degree 1): 1
Vertex 9 (degree 2): 9
Vertex 8 (degree 2): 8
Vertex 4 (degree 2): 4
Vertex 0 (degree 3): 0
Vertex 5 (degree 3): 5

Next, we relabel the vertices:
Vertex 1 (degree 0): 0
Vertex 6 (degree 0): 1
Vertex 7 (degree 0): 2
Vertex 3 (degree 1): 3
Vertex 1 (degree 1): 4
Vertex 9 (degree 2): 5
Vertex 8 (degree 2): 6
Vertex 4 (degree 2): 7
Vertex 0 (degree 3): 8
Vertex 5 (degree 3): 9

We will now check the edges using the relabeled vertices:
- (0, 5): Both 0 and 5 have degree 3, proceed.
- (0, 7): 0 has degree 3 and 7 has degree 0, proceed. They share a connection with 5, forming the triangle <0, 5, 7>.
- (2, 3): Both 2 and 3 have degree 1, proceed. They do not form a triangle with any other vertices.
- (2, 9): 2 has degree 1 and 9 has degree 2, proceed. They share a connection with 0, forming the triangle <0, 2, 9>.
- (3, 2): Ignored as per the method.
- (4, 5): Both 4 and 5 have degree 3, proceed.
- (4, 8): 4 has degree 2 and 8 has degree 2, proceed. They share a connection with 0, forming the triangle <0, 4, 8>.
- (5, 0): Ignored as per the method.
- (5, 4): Ignored as per the method.
- (7, 0): Ignored as per the method.
- (8, 4): Ignored as per the method.
- (8, 9): 8 has degree 2 and 9 has degree 2, proceed. They share a connection with 0, forming the triangle <0, 8, 9>.
- (9, 2): Ignored as per the method.
- (9, 8): Ignored as per the method.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles are <0, 5, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, and <0, 4, 8>.
