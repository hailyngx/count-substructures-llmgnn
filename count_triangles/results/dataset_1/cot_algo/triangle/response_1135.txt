Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Nodes in order of degree: 7, 0, 9, 2, 3, 6, 4, 8, 5, 1

Now, we will relabel the nodes:
Node 7 --> 0
Node 0 --> 1
Node 9 --> 2
Node 2 --> 3
Node 3 --> 4
Node 6 --> 5
Node 4 --> 6
Node 8 --> 7
Node 5 --> 8
Node 1 --> 9

Now, we will analyze the edges for triangles starting from the edge with the lower labeled vertex:
(0, 5): No triangles
(0, 9): No triangles
(1, 2): No triangles
(1, 4): No triangles
(1, 5): No triangles
(1, 6): No triangles
(1, 7): No triangles
(1, 8): Triangle found! <6, 7, 8>
(1, 9): No triangles
(2, 1): No triangles
(2, 3): No triangles
(2, 5): Triangle found! <3, 4, 8>
(2, 8): No triangles
(3, 2): No triangles
(3, 4): No triangles
(3, 6): No triangles
(4, 1): No triangles
(4, 3): No triangles
(4, 8): No triangles
(4, 9): No triangles
(5, 0): No triangles
(5, 1): No triangles
(5, 2): No triangles
(5, 6): Triangle found! <0, 1, 5>
(5, 8): Triangle found! <0, 1, 8>
(6, 1): No triangles
(6, 3): No triangles
(6, 5): Triangle found! <0, 1, 5>
(7, 1): No triangles
(8, 1): Triangle found! <0, 6, 7>
(8, 2): Triangle found! <3, 4, 8>
(8, 4): Triangle found! <3, 4, 8>
(8, 5): Triangle found! <0, 1, 8>
(9, 0): No triangles
(9, 1): No triangles
(9, 4): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <6, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 7>
