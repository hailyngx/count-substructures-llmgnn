Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
0: 2 connections
1: 1 connection
3: 2 connections
4: 1 connection
5: 2 connections
8: 1 connection
7: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
2: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree:
1: 1 connection
4: 1 connection
8: 1 connection
0: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
2: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
9: 4 connections

Next, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Triangle <0, 2, 3>
- Triangle <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle <5, 6, 7>
- Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
