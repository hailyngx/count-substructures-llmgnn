Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices by their degree. The degrees of each vertex in the given graph are as follows:

0: 5
1: 4
2: 2
3: 2
4: 1
5: 5
6: 4
7: 2
8: 2
9: 4

By sorting the vertices by their degree in non-decreasing order, we get the following list: 2 3 4 7 8 1 9 6 0 5.

Next, we examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Using this method, we find the following triangles: 

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
