Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree from least to most connections:
Vertices: 7, 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 2, 4, 6

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 → 0
1 → 1
2 → 2
3 → 3
4 → 4
5 → 5
6 → 6
7 → 7
8 → 8
9 → 9

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Starting with edge (0, 1): both vertices have the same degree so we proceed.
    - Looking for shared connections: (0, 1) shares node 6.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 6>
- Moving on to edge (0, 6): vertex 0 has fewer connections so we proceed.
    - Looking for shared connections: (0, 6) shares node 2.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>
- Continuing in this manner, we find the following triangles: 
    - <0, 1, 6>
    - <0, 2, 6>
    - <1, 4, 8>
    - <1, 4, 9>
    - <2, 3, 4>
    - <2, 5, 9>
    - <2, 6, 5>
    - <2, 6, 8>
    - <4, 8, 6>
    - <9, 1, 7>
    - <9, 2, 5>
    
Total number of triangles: [11]
