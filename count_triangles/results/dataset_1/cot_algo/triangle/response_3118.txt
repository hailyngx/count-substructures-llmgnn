Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) 

Response:
Firstly, let's list the nodes by their degrees from least to most:
Nodes: 4, 6, 0, 3, 7, 1, 5, 2

Now, let's list the edges in the same order keeping in mind that we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Edges: (1, 4), (3, 6), (0, 7), (2, 5), (2, 3), (1, 5)

Now we will count the triangles formed by these edges:

- Triangle <1, 4, 5>
- Triangle <2, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
