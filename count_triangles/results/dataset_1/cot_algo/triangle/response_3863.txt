Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 1
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 6

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 7 (degree 1) -> Node 0
Node 3 (degree 2) -> Node 1
Node 4 (degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 5 (degree 2) -> Node 3
Node 9 (degree 2) -> Node 4
Node 6 (degree 2) -> Node 5
Node 2 (degree 4) -> Node 6
Node 0 (degree 4) -> Node 7
Node 1 (degree 5) -> Node 8
Node 8 (degree 6) -> Node 9

Now let's list the edges with the corresponding relabeled nodes:

(7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 4)
(8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6)
(6, 7) (6, 5)
(5, 8) (5, 2)
(4, 7) (4, 2)
(0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9)
(9, 0) (9, 8)

Now we will count the triangles. Note that we only consider cases where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

From (7, 8), we have a triangle <7, 8, 0>.
From (7, 6), we have a triangle <7, 6, 0>.
From (7, 0), we have a triangle <7, 0, 8>.
From (4, 7), we have a triangle <4, 7, 2>.
From (6, 7), we have a triangle <6, 7, 0>.
From (0, 7), we have a triangle <0, 7, 6>.
From (5, 8), we have a triangle <5, 8, 2>.

So, the total number of triangles is [7] and the unique triangles found are <7, 8, 0>, <7, 6, 0>, <7, 0, 8>, <4, 7, 2>, <6, 7, 0>, <0, 7, 6>, <5, 8, 2>.
