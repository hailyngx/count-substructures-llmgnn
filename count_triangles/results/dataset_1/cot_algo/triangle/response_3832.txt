Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of connections for each node:

- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 9: 3 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their number of connections in ascending order:
- Node 0 (1 connection) --> Node A
- Node 2 (1 connection) --> Node B
- Node 6 (1 connection) --> Node C
- Node 8 (1 connection) --> Node D
- Node 1 (2 connections) --> Node E
- Node 4 (2 connections) --> Node F
- Node 9 (3 connections) --> Node G
- Node 3 (3 connections) --> Node H
- Node 5 (3 connections) --> Node I
- Node 7 (5 connections) --> Node J

Now, we will list the edges based on the new labeling:
- (A, E), (E, A), (E, G), (B, J), (H, F), (H, I), (H, J), (F, H), (F, J), (I, H), (I, J), (I, G), (C, D), (J, B), (J, H), (J, F), (J, I), (J, G), (D, C), (G, E), (G, I), (G, J)

Now, we will count the triangles formed:
- Triangle <E, F, H>
- Triangle <G, H, J>

Finally, we output the total number of triangles and the unique triangles found:
There are [2] triangles found.
The unique triangles are: <E, F, H> and <G, H, J>.
