Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertex 0 -> Degree 2
Vertex 1 -> Degree 3
Vertex 2 -> Degree 2
Vertex 3 -> Degree 7
Vertex 4 -> Degree 2
Vertex 5 -> Degree 4
Vertex 6 -> Degree 2
Vertex 7 -> Degree 2
Vertex 8 -> Degree 2
Vertex 9 -> Degree 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge and count the triangles based on shared connections:

Triangles:
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
