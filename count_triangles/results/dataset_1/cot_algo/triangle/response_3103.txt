Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 0 has 1 connection.
- Node 7 has 1 connection.
- Node 8 has 1 connection.
- Node 3 has 2 connections.
- Node 2 has 2 connections.
- Node 6 has 3 connections.
- Node 5 has 4 connections.
- Node 4 has 4 connections.
- Node 1 has 6 connections.
- Node 9 has 7 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph.

Triangles:
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <2, 1, 9>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <6, 9, 1>

Final count: [10]
