Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 4 has 1 connection
Vertices 2, 7, and 8 have 2 connections each
Vertices 1 and 5 have 3 connections each
Vertices 3 and 9 have 4 connections each
Vertex 0 has 5 connections
Vertex 6 has 6 connections

We will start counting triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Examining the edges in the sorted order, we find the following triangles:

<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

After counting all the triangles, we find a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
