Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles:

Vertices by their number of connections:
Node 8: 0 connections
Nodes 1, 4, 5: 1 connection
Nodes 0, 1: 2 connections
Nodes 6, 9: 3 connections
Nodes 2, 3, 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

Relabeling of the vertices:
Node 8 -> 0
Node 1 -> 1
Node 4 -> 2
Node 5 -> 3
Node 0 -> 4
Node 1 -> 5
Node 6 -> 6
Node 9 -> 7
Node 2 -> 8
Node 3 -> 9
Node 5 -> 10
Node 7 -> 11

Now, we will check for triangles:
1. For edge (0, 2): No triangle formed.
2. For edge (0, 5): No triangle formed.
3. For edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
4. For edge (2, 0): No triangle formed.
5. For edge (2, 7): Triangle <2, 8, 11>.
6. For edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
7. For edge (3, 7): Triangle <3, 9, 11>.
8. For edge (3, 9): No triangle formed.
9. For edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.
10. For edge (5, 0): No triangle formed.
11. For edge (6, 1): No triangle formed.
12. For edge (6, 3): No triangle formed.
13. For edge (7, 2): Triangle <2, 8, 11>.
14. For edge (7, 3): Triangle <3, 9, 11>.
15. For edge (7, 4): No triangle formed.
16. For edge (7, 9): No triangle formed.
17. For edge (9, 3): No triangle formed.
18. For edge (9, 7): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles found: <2, 8, 11>, <3, 9, 11>.
