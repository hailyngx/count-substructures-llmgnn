Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 1 (Degree 2)
- Node 4 (Degree 2)
- Node 5 (Degree 2)
- Node 3 (Degree 2)
- Node 7 (Degree 2)
- Node 2 (Degree 2)
- Node 9 (Degree 3)
- Node 0 (Degree 5)
- Node 6 (Degree 6)
- Node 8 (Degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 1): Forms triangle with node 6. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
- Edge (0, 6): No additional triangles
- Edge (0, 8): Forms triangle with node 1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Edge (0, 9): No additional triangles
- Edge (1, 3): No additional triangles
- Edge (1, 6): No additional triangles
- Edge (1, 8): No additional triangles
- Edge (2, 4): No additional triangles
- Edge (2, 5): No additional triangles
- Edge (3, 7): No additional triangles
- Edge (4, 8): No additional triangles
- Edge (5, 6): No additional triangles
- Edge (6, 7): Forms triangle with node 3. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
- Edge (6, 8): Forms triangles with nodes 0 and 1. Triangles <0, 1, 6> and <1, 6, 8>
- Edge (6, 9): No additional triangles
- Edge (7, 3): No additional triangles
- Edge (8, 0): Forms triangle with node 1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Edge (8, 4): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
- Edge (8, 6): Forms triangles with nodes 0 and 1. Triangles <0, 1, 8> and <1, 6, 8>
- Edge (9, 0): No additional triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, and <3, 6, 7>.
