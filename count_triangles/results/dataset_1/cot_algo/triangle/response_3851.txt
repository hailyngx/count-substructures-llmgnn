Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 6 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.

Relabeling the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes in order: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9, 1, 6, 5

Now, we will check each edge and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge between nodes 0 and 8: No triangle.
2. Edge between nodes 1 and 3: No triangle.
3. Edge between nodes 1 and 5: Triangle <1, 5, 7>.
4. Edge between nodes 1 and 6: No triangle.
5. Edge between nodes 1 and 7: Triangle <1, 7, 5>.
6. Edge between nodes 1 and 8: No triangle.
7. Edge between nodes 2 and 5: No triangle.
8. Edge between nodes 2 and 6: No triangle.
9. Edge between nodes 3 and 7: Triangle <1, 7, 5>.
10. Edge between nodes 4 and 5: No triangle.
11. Edge between nodes 4 and 6: No triangle.
12. Edge between nodes 4 and 9: No triangle.
13. Edge between nodes 5 and 1: Triangle <1, 5, 7>.
14. Edge between nodes 5 and 2: No triangle.
15. Edge between nodes 5 and 4: No triangle.
16. Edge between nodes 5 and 6: Triangle <1, 6, 5> and Triangle <6, 5, 9>.
17. Edge between nodes 5 and 7: Triangle <1, 7, 5>.
18. Edge between nodes 5 and 9: Triangle <1, 6, 5> and Triangle <6, 5, 9>.
19. Edge between nodes 6 and 1: No triangle.
20. Edge between nodes 6 and 2: No triangle.
21. Edge between nodes 6 and 4: No triangle.
22. Edge between nodes 6 and 5: Triangle <1, 6, 5> and Triangle <6, 5, 9>.
23. Edge between nodes 6 and 9: No triangle.
24. Edge between nodes 7 and 1: Triangle <1, 7, 5>.
25. Edge between nodes 7 and 3: Triangle <1, 7, 5>.
26. Edge between nodes 7 and 5: Triangle <1, 7, 5>.
27. Edge between nodes 7 and 8: No triangle.
28. Edge between nodes 8 and 0: No triangle.
29. Edge between nodes 8 and 1: No triangle.
30. Edge between nodes 8 and 7: No triangle.
31. Edge between nodes 9 and 4: No triangle.
32. Edge between nodes 9 and 5: Triangle <1, 6, 5> and Triangle <6, 5, 9>.
33. Edge between nodes 9 and 6: No triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10] and unique triangles found are <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 5>, and <6, 5, 9>.
