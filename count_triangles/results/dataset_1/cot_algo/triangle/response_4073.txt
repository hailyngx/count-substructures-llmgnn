Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 5 has 0 connections.
Nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 3 and 9 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 4 and 7 have 4 connections each.
Node 0 has 5 connections.
Node 6 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges to count the number of triangles:
1. Edge (1, 0): No triangles are formed.
2. Edge (2, 0): No triangles are formed.
3. Edge (5, 8): No triangles are formed.
4. Edge (5, 8): No triangles are formed.
5. Edge (3, 1): No triangles are formed.
6. Edge (3, 7): No triangles are formed.
7. Edge (3, 9): No triangles are formed.
8. Edge (3, 9): No triangles are formed.
9. Edge (4, 0): No triangles are formed.
10. Edge (4, 2): No triangles are formed.
11. Edge (4, 6): No triangles are formed.
12. Edge (4, 6): No triangles are formed.
13. Edge (6, 4): Forms a triangle <4, 6, 9>.
14. Edge (6, 7): No triangles are formed.
15. Edge (6, 7): Forms a triangle <6, 7, 3>.
16. Edge (6, 9): Forms a triangle <4, 6, 9>.
17. Edge (7, 0): Forms a triangle <7, 0, 8>.
18. Edge (7, 1): No triangles are formed.
19. Edge (7, 3): Forms a triangle <6, 7, 3>.
20. Edge (7, 6): Forms a triangle <6, 7, 3>.
21. Edge (8, 0): Forms a triangle <7, 0, 8>.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles: <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 3>, <7, 0, 8>.
