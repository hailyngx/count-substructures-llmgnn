Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 9 has 0 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Nodes 1, 7, and 8 have 4 connections.
Nodes 0 and 4 have 5 connections.
Node 6 has 6 connections.

Now, we analyze each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

For the edge (0, 1):
Both nodes 0 and 1 have 4 shared connections: 3, 4, 5, and 8.
Therefore, <0, 1, 3> and <0, 1, 4> triangles are formed.

For the edge (0, 3):
Both nodes 0 and 3 have 2 shared connections: 4 and 5.
Therefore, <0, 3, 4> triangle is formed.

For the edge (0, 4):
Both nodes 0 and 4 have 2 shared connections: 5 and 8.
Therefore, <0, 4, 5> triangle is formed.

For the edge (0, 5):
Both nodes 0 and 5 have 1 shared connection: 4.
Therefore, <0, 5, 4> triangle is formed.

For the edge (0, 8):
Both nodes 0 and 8 have 1 shared connection: 4.
Therefore, <0, 8, 4> triangle is formed.

For the edge (1, 6):
Node 1 has fewer connections than 6.
Node 1 and 6 have 1 shared connection: 7.
Therefore, <1, 6, 7> triangle is formed.

For the edge (1, 7):
Both nodes 1 and 7 have 1 shared connection: 1.
Therefore, <1, 7, 1> triangle is formed.

For the edge (2, 4):
Node 2 has fewer connections than 4.
Both nodes 2 and 4 have 1 shared connection: 6.
Therefore, <2, 4, 6> triangle is formed.

For the edge (2, 6):
Node 2 has fewer connections than 6.
Both nodes 2 and 6 have 1 shared connection: 1.
Therefore, <2, 6, 1> triangle is formed.

For the edge (3, 7):
Node 3 has fewer connections than 7.
Both nodes 3 and 7 have 1 shared connection: 1.
Therefore, <3, 7, 1> triangle is formed.

For the edge (4, 8):
Node 4 has fewer connections than 8.
Both nodes 4 and 8 have 1 shared connection: 0.
Therefore, <4, 8, 0> triangle is formed.

For the edge (6, 7):
Both nodes 6 and 7 have 2 shared connections: 1 and 3.
Therefore, <6, 7, 1> triangle is formed.

For the edge (8, 7):
Node 8 has fewer connections than 7.
Both nodes 8 and 7 have 1 shared connection: 0.
Therefore, <8, 7, 0> triangle is formed.

The total number of triangles is [13].
