Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following labels for the vertices:
Vertex 7 has 0 connections
Vertex 6 has 1 connections
Vertices 8 and 1 have 1 connections
Vertices 2, 4, and 7 have 2 connections
Vertices 3 and 0 have 3 connections
Vertices 5 and 9 have 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will proceed to count the number of triangles:
1. Edge (0, 5): Check shared connections between vertices 0 and 5 (1 shared connection with vertex 9): Triangle <0, 5, 9>.
2. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 9, so we proceed.
3. Edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 has the same number of connections as vertex 4, so we skip this edge.
4. Edge (1, 5): Check shared connections between vertices 1 and 5 (1 shared connection with vertex 4): Triangle <1, 5, 4>.
5. Edge (2, 5): Check shared connections between vertices 2 and 5 (1 shared connection with vertex 9): Triangle <2, 5, 9>.
6. Edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 9, so we proceed.
7. Edge (3, 5): Check shared connections between vertices 3 and 5 (2 shared connections with vertices 6 and 8): Triangles <3, 5, 6> and <3, 5, 8>.
8. Edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 6, so we skip this edge.
9. Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 8, so we skip this edge.
10. Edge (4, 1): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 4, so we proceed.
11. Edge (4, 5): Check shared connections between vertices 4 and 5 (1 shared connection with vertex 9): Triangle <4, 5, 9>.
12. Edge (4, 9): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 9, so we proceed.
13. Edge (5, 0): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 5, so we proceed.
14. Edge (5, 1): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 5, so we proceed.
15. Edge (5, 2): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 5, so we proceed.
16. Edge (5, 3): Check shared connections between vertices 3 and 5 (2 shared connections with vertices 6 and 8): Triangles <5, 3, 6> and <5, 3, 8>.
17. Edge (5, 4): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 5, so we proceed.
18. Edge (5, 9): Check shared connections between vertices 5 and 9 (1 shared connection with vertex 4): Triangle <5, 9, 4>.
19. Edge (6, 3): Vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 6, so we skip this edge.
20. Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has fewer connections than vertex 9, so we proceed.
21. Edge (8, 3): Vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 8, so we skip this edge.
22. Edge (9, 0): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 9, so we proceed.
23. Edge (9, 2): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 9, so we proceed.
24. Edge (9, 4): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 9, so we proceed.
25. Edge (9, 5): Check shared connections between vertices 9 and 5 (1 shared connection with vertex 4): Triangle <9, 5, 4>.
26. Edge (9, 7): Vertex 7 has fewer connections than vertex 9, so we proceed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9] with unique triangles being <0, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 4>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 3, 6>, <5, 3, 8>, and <9, 5, 4>.
