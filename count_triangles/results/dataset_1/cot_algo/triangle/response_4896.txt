Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
By using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Using the degree-based ordering, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 1), (2, 1), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 4), (1, 2), (6, 3), (6, 7), (5, 8), (9, 5), (3, 4), (9, 6), (5, 9), (4, 9), (6, 9), (3, 5), (4, 7), (5, 1), (4, 6), (4, 8), (1, 5), (3, 6), (7, 4), (9, 3).

After checking the shared connections between the vertices of each edge, the total number of triangles is [7].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
