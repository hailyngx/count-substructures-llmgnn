Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following relabeling: 
Node 0 has degree 2 
Node 1 has degree 2 
Node 2 has degree 1 
Node 5 has degree 1 
Node 7 has degree 1 
Node 8 has degree 2 
Node 6 has degree 2 
Node 3 has degree 2 
Node 9 has degree 4 
Node 4 has degree 5 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles in the graph: 
1. Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <0, 3, 4> 
2. Edge (0, 5) does not form a triangle 
3. Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle 
4. Edge (1, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <1, 8, 6> 
5. Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle 
6. Edge (3, 0) already counted 
7. Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle 
8. Edge (4, 1) already counted 
9. Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle 
10. Edge (4, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 8: <4, 6, 8> 
11. Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <4, 9, 3> 
12. Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle 
13. Edge (6, 4) already counted 
14. Edge (6, 8) already counted 
15. Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle 
16. Edge (8, 1) already counted 
17. Edge (8, 6) already counted 
18. Edge (9, 3) already counted 
19. Edge (9, 4) already counted 
20. Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle 

Total number of triangles: [3] 

Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 4>, <1, 8, 6>, <4, 6, 8>
