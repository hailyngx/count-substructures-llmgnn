Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each vertex in the graph:

Vertex 0: Degree 2
Vertex 1: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 2
Vertex 3: Degree 2
Vertex 4: Degree 3
Vertex 5: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 1
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 4

Next, we need to reorder the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:

Vertex 6 (Degree 1)
Vertex 0 (Degree 2)
Vertex 2 (Degree 2)
Vertex 3 (Degree 2)
Vertex 4 (Degree 3)
Vertex 1 (Degree 3)
Vertex 8 (Degree 4)
Vertex 5 (Degree 4)
Vertex 9 (Degree 4)

Now, we will count the number of triangles by examining each edge following the degree-based ordering:

Triangles:
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <4, 3, 5>
- <8, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
