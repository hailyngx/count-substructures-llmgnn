Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections

Edges to be considered based on the method:
(0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 9) (6, 7) (7, 4)

Calculating the triangles:

For edge (0, 1):
No triangles can be formed.

For edge (0, 2):
No triangles can be formed.

For edge (0, 5):
No triangles can be formed.

For edge (0, 6):
Triangle found: <0, 2, 6>

For edge (0, 9):
No triangles can be formed.

For edge (1, 8):
No triangles can be formed.

For edge (2, 6):
No triangles can be formed.

For edge (3, 5):
No triangles can be formed.

For edge (4, 9):
No triangles can be formed.

For edge (6, 7):
Triangle found: <6, 0, 7>

For edge (7, 4):
No triangles can be formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
