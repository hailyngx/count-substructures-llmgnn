Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Node 3 - 2 connections
Node 6 - 2 connections
Node 8 - 2 connections
Node 0 - 3 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 2 - 4 connections
Node 9 - 5 connections
Node 4 - 6 connections
Node 7 - 6 connections
Now, we will examine each edge based on the labeling to count the number of triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): No triangle formed.
- Edge (0, 7): Triangle <0, 2, 7> found.
- Edge (0, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 4): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 0): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 7): Triangle <0, 2, 7> found.
- Edge (2, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 1): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 1): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 5): Triangle <1, 4, 5> found.
- Edge (4, 7): Triangle <0, 4, 7> found.
- Edge (4, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 1): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 5> found.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 7): Triangle <0, 5, 7> found.
- Edge (6, 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 0): Triangle <0, 2, 7> found.
- Edge (7, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 7> found.
- Edge (7, 4): Triangle <0, 4, 7> found.
- Edge (7, 5): Triangle <0, 5, 7> found.
- Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 0): No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 2): No triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 1): No triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 2): No triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 4): No triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 7): No triangle formed.

By counting the triangles formed, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
