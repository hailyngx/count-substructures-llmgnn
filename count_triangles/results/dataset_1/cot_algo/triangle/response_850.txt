Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 2

Nodes in increasing order of degree: 3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 0, 6, 8, 1, 7

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles:

- Triangle <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle <0, 1, 7>

Total number of triangles: [2]
