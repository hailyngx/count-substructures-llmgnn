Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
We will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph. First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections).

The vertices with their connections are as follows:
0: 3 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 2 connections

Now we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:
1: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
0: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
8: 3 connections

Next, we will list the triangles formed by shared connections:
- Triangle 1: <0, 6, 8>
- Triangle 2: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle 4: <0, 9, 2>
- Triangle 5: <6, 7, 0>
- Triangle 6: <6, 7, 8>
- Triangle 7: <6, 8, 5>
- Triangle 8: <6, 8, 3>
- Triangle 9: <7, 0, 6>
- Triangle 10: <8, 6, 0>

Now, we count the total number of triangles, which is 10.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
