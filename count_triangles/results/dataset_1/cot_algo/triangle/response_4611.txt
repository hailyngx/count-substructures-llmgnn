Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted list of vertices is: 8, 1, 6, 4, 5, 7, 2, 9, 0, 3.

Now, we proceed with the edges based on the order of the vertices:

1. Edge between 8 and 0: Both vertices have 2 connections, so we proceed because the lower labeled vertex, 8, has fewer connections.
    - Shared connections: {0}

2. Edge between 1 and 2: Vertex 1 has 3 connections while vertex 2 has 4 connections, so we don't proceed.

3. Edge between 6 and 4: Both vertices have 2 connections, so we proceed because the lower labeled vertex, 6, has fewer connections.
    - Shared connections: {7}

4. Edge between 4 and 8: Both vertices have 2 connections, so we proceed because the lower labeled vertex, 4, has fewer connections.
    - Shared connections: {9}

5. Edge between 5 and 9: Both vertices have 4 connections, so we don't proceed.

6. Edge between 7 and 6: Vertex 7 has 3 connections while vertex 6 has 2 connections, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections: {0}

7. Edge between 2 and 3: Vertex 2 has 4 connections while vertex 3 has 4 connections, so we don't proceed.

8. Edge between 9 and 0: Both vertices have 4 connections, so we don't proceed.

9. Edge between 0 and 3: Both vertices have 4 connections, so we don't proceed.

10. Edge between 3 and 7: Vertex 3 has 4 connections while vertex 7 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections: {0}

11. Edge between 2 and 5: Vertex 2 has 4 connections while vertex 5 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections: {1}

12. Edge between 2 and 1: Vertex 2 has 4 connections while vertex 1 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections: {5}

There are 5 triangles in total, and they are <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <6, 4, 7>, <2, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
