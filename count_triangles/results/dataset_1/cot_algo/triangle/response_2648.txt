Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are: 5, 1, 9, 0, 7, 8, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3

The triangles found in the graph are:
<4, 0, 2>
<6, 0, 4>
<6, 3, 4>
<8, 1, 6>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
