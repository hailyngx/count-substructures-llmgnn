Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0 has 1 connection
- Node 1 has 0 connections
- Node 2 has 1 connection
- Node 3 has 3 connections
- Node 4 has 3 connections
- Node 5 has 3 connections
- Node 6 has 3 connections
- Node 7 has 2 connections
- Node 8 has 2 connections
- Node 9 has 2 connections

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 3): Node 0 (label 1) has 1 connection, and Node 3 (label 4) has 3 connections. We can form triangles <0, 3, x> where x is any shared connection between nodes 0 and 3. In this case, the shared connection between nodes 0 and 3 is node 4.

2. Edge (2, 5): Node 2 (label 1) has 1 connection, and Node 5 (label 4) has 3 connections. We can form triangles <2, 5, x> where x is any shared connection between nodes 2 and 5. In this case, the shared connection between nodes 2 and 5 is node 4.

3. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 (label 4) has 3 connections, and Node 4 (label 4) has 3 connections. We can form triangles <3, 4, x> where x is any shared connection between nodes 3 and 4. In this case, the shared connections between nodes 3 and 4 are nodes 5 and 6.

4. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 (label 4) has 3 connections, and Node 6 (label 4) has 3 connections. We can form triangles <3, 6, x> where x is any shared connection between nodes 3 and 6. In this case, the shared connection between nodes 3 and 6 is node 4.

5. Edge (4, 5): Node 4 (label 4) has 3 connections, and Node 5 (label 4) has 3 connections. We can form triangles <4, 5, x> where x is any shared connection between nodes 4 and 5. In this case, the shared connection between nodes 4 and 5 is node 3.

6. Edge (4, 6): Node 4 (label 4) has 3 connections, and Node 6 (label 4) has 3 connections. We can form triangles <4, 6, x> where x is any shared connection between nodes 4 and 6. In this case, the shared connection between nodes 4 and 6 is node 3.

7. Edge (5, 7): Node 5 (label 4) has 3 connections, and Node 7 (label 4) has 2 connections. We can form triangles <5, 7, x> where x is any shared connection between nodes 5 and 7. In this case, there are no shared connections between nodes 5 and 7.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 3>, <4, 6, 3>.
