Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 1: 2 connections  
Node 4: 2 connections  
Node 9: 3 connections  
Node 7: 3 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 8: 5 connections  
Node 0: 5 connections  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles by following the steps mentioned earlier.

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
