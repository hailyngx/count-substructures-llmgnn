Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes by their degrees:

Node 1: 0 connections
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection 
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Now, let's re-label the nodes accordingly:
Node 1: 0 connections -> Node 0
Node 3: 0 connections -> Node 1
Node 5: 0 connections -> Node 2
Node 6: 1 connection -> Node 3
Node 8: 1 connection -> Node 4
Node 9: 2 connections -> Node 5
Node 2: 3 connections -> Node 6
Node 4: 4 connections -> Node 7
Node 7: 6 connections -> Node 8
Node 0: 6 connections -> Node 9

Now, let's check for triangles:

- (0, 2) shares a connection with 7 forming the triangle <0, 2, 7>
- (0, 7) doesn't form a triangle
- (0, 9) doesn't form a triangle
- (2, 4) forms the triangle <2, 4, 7>
- (2, 7) doesn't form a triangle
- (3, 6) doesn't form a triangle
- (4, 6) forms the triangle <4, 6, 7>
- (4, 7) forms the triangle <4, 7, 0>
- (4, 8) doesn't form a triangle
- (5, 7) doesn't form a triangle
- (6, 3) doesn't form a triangle
- (7, 5) doesn't form a triangle
- (7, 9) doesn't form a triangle

Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [3]
Unique triangles found inside <>: <0, 2, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 7>
