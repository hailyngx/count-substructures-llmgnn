Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 3 -> 0 connections
Node 1 -> 1 connection
Node 5 -> 2 connections
Node 7 -> 2 connections
Node 4 -> 3 connections
Node 9 -> 3 connections
Node 6 -> 4 connections
Node 8 -> 4 connections
Node 2 -> 5 connections
Node 0 -> 5 connections

Let's identify the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

By examining the edges and considering only cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4> (Shared connection: 2)
2. Triangle <0, 4, 8> (Shared connection: 4)
3. Triangle <0, 6, 8> (Shared connection: 0)
4. Triangle <0, 6, 9> (Shared connection: 6)
5. Triangle <1, 0, 2> (Shared connection: 0)
6. Triangle <4, 7, 8> (Shared connection: 7)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
