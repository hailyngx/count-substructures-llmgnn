Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

The sorted vertices based on the number of connections they have are:
0(5), 1(2), 5(3), 7(1), 4(2), 8(3), 6(3), 2(2), 9(6), 3(4)

Starting with the edge with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 2: [0, 3, 9]
Edge (0, 3): Shared connections with 3: [0, 5, 9]
Edge (0, 4): No triangle
Edge (0, 6): No triangle
Edge (0, 9): Shared connections with 9: [0, 2, 3, 6]

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 9>
