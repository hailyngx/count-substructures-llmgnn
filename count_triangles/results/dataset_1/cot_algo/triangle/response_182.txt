Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:  
Vertex 0: 2 connections  
Vertex 1: 6 connections  
Vertex 2: 1 connection  
Vertex 3: 2 connections  
Vertex 4: 5 connections  
Vertex 5: 2 connections  
Vertex 6: 5 connections  
Vertex 7: 5 connections  
Vertex 8: 4 connections  
Vertex 9: 4 connections  

Now, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order and relabel them accordingly:  
Vertex 2: 0 connections  
Vertex 5: 2 connections  
Vertex 3: 2 connections  
Vertex 0: 2 connections  
Vertex 8: 4 connections  
Vertex 9: 4 connections  
Vertex 4: 5 connections  
Vertex 6: 5 connections  
Vertex 7: 5 connections  
Vertex 1: 6 connections  

Next, we will iterate through the edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:  
<0, 1, 6>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<0, 6, 4>  
<1, 2, 3>  
<1, 2, 8>  
<1, 3, 6>  
<1, 3, 9>  
<1, 4, 9>  
<1, 6, 3>  
<1, 6, 4>  
<1, 6, 9>  
<1, 8, 4>  
<1, 9, 4>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 6, 8>  
<4, 7, 8>  
<4, 8, 7>  
<4, 9, 5>  
<6, 7, 4>  
<6, 7, 8>  
<6, 7, 9>  
<6, 8, 7>  
<6, 9, 4>  
<6, 9, 5>  
<7, 8, 4>  
<7, 8, 6>  
<7, 9, 6>  
<8, 9, 4>  
<8, 9, 7>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [29].
