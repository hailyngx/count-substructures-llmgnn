Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0: 2 connections 
Node 1: 2 connections 
Node 4: 2 connections 
Node 3: 3 connections 
Node 9: 3 connections 
Node 5: 4 connections 
Node 8: 4 connections 
Node 7: 5 connections 
Node 6: 6 connections 
Node 2: 6 connections 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check the edges using the new vertex labels to count the triangles. 

Count of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 7, 5>
<3, 0, 7>
<4, 5, 2>
