Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on their degrees:
Vertices: 2, 7, 8, 5, 1, 6, 3, 9, 0, 4

Using the given edges, we find the triangles formed as follows:
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection to 9: <0, 4, 9>
- Edge (0, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection to 4: <0, 9, 4>
- Edge (1, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection to 6: <3, 2, 6>
- Edge (3, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection to 1: <3, 6, 1>
- Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection to 9: <4, 0, 9>
- Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection to 0: <4, 9, 0>
- Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection to 0: <5, 9, 0>
- Edge (6, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection to 4: <9, 0, 4>
- Edge (9, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <3, 2, 6>, <3, 6, 1>, <5, 9, 0>, <9, 0, 4>
