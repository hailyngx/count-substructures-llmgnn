Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by number of connections:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
Checking edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 0 and 2 are 4. Triangle <0, 2, 4> found.
- Edge (0, 4): Shared connections with 0 and 4 are 2. No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 3): Shared connections with 1 and 3 are 4. Triangle <1, 3, 4> found.
