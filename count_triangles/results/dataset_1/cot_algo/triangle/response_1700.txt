Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the resulting order is: 5, 7, 6, 0, 2, 8, 9, 3, 1, 4. 

Counting the triangles with the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Starting with vertex 5: No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to vertex 7: No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to vertex 6: No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to vertex 0: No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to vertex 2: No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to vertex 8: No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to vertex 9: No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to vertex 3: Triangles can be formed with edges (0,3), (2,3), and (3,4). These form the triangle <0, 2, 3>.
- Moving to vertex 1: Triangles can be formed with edges (0,1), (1,4), and (1,9). These form the triangle <0, 1, 4>.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3> and <0, 1, 4>.
