Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertex 1: degree 1
Vertex 3: degree 1
Vertex 4: degree 1
Vertex 9: degree 1
Vertex 7: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 4

Now, let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method:

(1, 9) - No triangles
(3, 2) - No triangles
(4, 7) - No triangles
(9, 1) - No triangles

(0, 2):
- Shared connections: 5
- Triangle: <0, 2, 5>

(0, 5) - No triangles
(0, 6) - No triangles
(0, 8) - No triangles

(2, 3) - No triangles

(7, 4) - No triangles
(7, 8) - No triangles

(8, 6) - No triangles
(8, 7) - No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 2, 5>.
