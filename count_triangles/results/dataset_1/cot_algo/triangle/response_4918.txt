Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Based on the provided information, the sorted vertices are as follows:
Vertices: 7, 0, 8, 2, 4, 5, 9, 3, 6, 1

Now, we will count the triangles by looking at the edges and checking for shared connections:
1. Edge (0, 1) - Vertices 0 and 1 share connections with vertices 3 and 4. Therefore, a triangle is formed <0, 1, 3>.
2. Edge (0, 3) - Vertices 0 and 3 share connections with vertices 1 and 4. Therefore, another triangle is formed <0, 1, 3>.
3. Edge (0, 4) - Vertices 0 and 4 share a connection with vertex 1. Therefore, no new triangles are formed as it is a duplicate.
4. Edge (1, 2) - No triangles are formed.
5. Edge (1, 3) - Vertices 1 and 3 share connections with vertices 0, 4, 6, and 9. Therefore, triangles are formed <1, 3, 0> and <1, 3, 6>.
6. Edge (1, 5) - No triangles are formed.
7. Edge (1, 6) - Vertices 1 and 6 share connections with vertices 3 and 5. Therefore, a triangle is formed <1, 6, 3>.
8. Edge (1, 8) - No triangles are formed.
9. Edge (2, 1) - No triangles are formed.
10. Edge (3, 0) - No new triangles formed as it is a duplicate.
11. Edge (3, 1) - No new triangles formed as it is a duplicate.
12. Edge (3, 6) - Vertices 3 and 6 share connections with vertices 1 and 9. Therefore, a triangle is formed <3, 6, 1>.
13. Edge (3, 9) - Vertices 3 and 9 share connections with vertices 1 and 6. Therefore, a triangle is formed <3, 9, 1>.
14. Edge (4, 0) - No new triangles formed as it is a duplicate.
15. Edge (5, 1) - No triangles are formed.
16. Edge (5, 6) - No new triangles are formed as it is a duplicate.
17. Edge (6, 1) - No new triangles formed as it is a duplicate.
18. Edge (6, 3) - No new triangles are formed as it is a duplicate.
19. Edge (6, 5) - No triangles are formed.
20. Edge (6, 9) - No new triangles are formed as it is a duplicate.
21. Edge (8, 1) - No triangles are formed.
22. Edge (9, 3) - No new triangles formed as it is a duplicate.
23. Edge (9, 6) - No new triangles are formed as it is a duplicate.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] with unique triangles being <0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 6>, and <3, 9, 1>.
