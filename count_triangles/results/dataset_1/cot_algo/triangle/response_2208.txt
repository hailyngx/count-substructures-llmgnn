Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes: 
0 (degree 3)
1 (degree 0)
2 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
4 (degree 4)
5 (degree 2)
6 (degree 1)
7 (degree 2)
8 (degree 4)
9 (degree 2)

Now, we will relabel the nodes according to their degree in ascending order: 
Nodes: 
1 (degree 0)
6 (degree 1)
5 (degree 2)
7 (degree 2)
9 (degree 2)
0 (degree 3)
2 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
8 (degree 4)
4 (degree 4)

Next, we will go through each edge and identify the triangles:

Triangles: 
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 9, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 0>
<8, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
