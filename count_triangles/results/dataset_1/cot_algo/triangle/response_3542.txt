Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their degrees, we have:
Vertex 0: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 4: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 5
Vertex 2: degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the triangles formed by shared connections:
- Edge (0, 2): <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 8): <1, 8, 5>
- Edge (2, 0): <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (2, 5): <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (2, 7): <2, 7, 5>
- Edge (2, 8): <1, 8, 2>
- Edge (3, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6): <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (4, 8): <1, 8, 4>
- Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 2): <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (5, 7): <2, 7, 5>
- Edge (5, 8): <1, 8, 5>
- Edge (6, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 4): <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (6, 8): <1, 8, 4>
- Edge (7, 2): <2, 7, 5>
- Edge (7, 5): <2, 7, 5>
- Edge (7, 9): <7, 9, 4>
- Edge (8, 1): <1, 8, 5>
- Edge (8, 2): <1, 8, 2>
- Edge (8, 4): <1, 8, 4>
- Edge (8, 5): <1, 8, 5>
- Edge (8, 6): <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (9, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7): <7, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
