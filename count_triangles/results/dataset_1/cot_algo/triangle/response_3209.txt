Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 1 has degree 1
- Vertices 0, 1, 6, and 9 have degree 2
- Vertices 4 and 7 have degree 3
- Vertices 3 and 5 have degree 4
- Vertex 2 has degree 5
- Vertex 8 has degree 6

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 1 (degree 1) becomes vertex 0
- Vertices 0, 1, 6, and 9 (degree 2) become vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4
- Vertices 4 and 7 (degree 3) become vertices 5 and 6
- Vertices 3 and 5 (degree 4) become vertices 7 and 8
- Vertex 2 (degree 5) becomes vertex 9
- Vertex 8 (degree 6) becomes vertex 10

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
1. Edge between vertices 1 and 2: Forms a triangle with vertex 0. <0, 1, 2>
2. Edge between vertices 1 and 4: Forms a triangle with vertex 6. <1, 4, 5>
3. Edge between vertices 1 and 9: Forms a triangle with vertex 2. <1, 2, 4>
4. Edge between vertices 2 and 3: Forms a triangle with vertex 0. <0, 2, 3>
5. Edge between vertices 2 and 6: Forms a triangle with vertex 8. <2, 3, 6>
6. Edge between vertices 2 and 9: Forms a triangle with vertex 4. <2, 4, 9>
7. Edge between vertices 3 and 5: Forms a triangle with vertex 0. <0, 3, 5>
8. Edge between vertices 4 and 5: Forms a triangle with vertex 7. <4, 5, 8>
9. Edge between vertices 5 and 8: Forms a triangle with vertex 6. <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
