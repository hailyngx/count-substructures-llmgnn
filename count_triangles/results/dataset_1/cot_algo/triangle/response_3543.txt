Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After arranging the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 1: 4 connections  
Vertex 2: 3 connections  
Vertex 8: 3 connections  
Vertex 6: 1 connection  
Vertex 9: 2 connections  
Vertex 5: 6 connections  
Vertex 3: 5 connections  
Vertex 7: 5 connections  
Vertex 4: 7 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following sequence:  
(6, 3) (9, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 9) (3, 7) (7, 1) (1, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (3, 6) (1, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (5, 2) (5, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (5, 4)

After considering the given edges in the specified order, we count the total number of triangles to be [11].  
The unique triangles identified in the graph are:  
<1, 4, 7>  
<1, 4, 5>  
<1, 7, 3>  
<1, 7, 5>  
<2, 5, 4>  
<3, 5, 7>  
<3, 4, 5>  
<3, 5, 7>  
<4, 7, 5>  
<5, 7, 4>  
<7, 4, 5>
