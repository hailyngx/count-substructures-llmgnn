Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 1: degree 2
Node 5: degree 1
Node 7: degree 1
Node 8: degree 2
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 9: degree 6
Node 2: degree 7

Relabeling the vertices:
Node 2 (degree 7) -> Node 0
Node 9 (degree 6) -> Node 1
Node 3 (degree 5) -> Node 2
Node 0 (degree 5) -> Node 3
Node 6 (degree 4) -> Node 4
Node 4 (degree 4) -> Node 5
Node 1 (degree 2) -> Node 6
Node 8 (degree 2) -> Node 7
Node 5 (degree 1) -> Node 8
Node 7 (degree 1) -> Node 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
