Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree:
Node 3: degree 0
Node 5: degree 1
Node 8: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5

Triangles:
[8]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1]. 
The unique triangle found is <6, 1, 4>.
