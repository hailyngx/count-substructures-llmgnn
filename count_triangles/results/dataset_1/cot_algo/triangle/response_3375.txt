Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Vertex 0 has 4 connections
Vertex 1 has 2 connections
Vertex 2 has 2 connections
Vertex 3 has 2 connections
Vertex 4 has 5 connections
Vertex 5 has 5 connections
Vertex 6 has 4 connections
Vertex 7 has 3 connections
Vertex 8 has 3 connections
Vertex 9 has 2 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges in the following order:
(1, 6)
(1, 7)
(2, 0) - Triangle <0, 2, 4>
(2, 4)
(3, 4)
(3, 8) - Triangle <3, 4, 8>
(4, 6)
(4, 5) - Triangle <4, 5, 6>
(5, 7)
(7, 9)

After analyzing all edges, we found a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
