Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 4, degree 1
Node 7, degree 2
Node 9, degree 2
Node 5, degree 3
Node 8, degree 3
Node 1, degree 4
Node 2, degree 4
Node 6, degree 4
Node 3, degree 5

Edges considered based on lower label having fewer connections:
(1, 2) - Nodes 1 and 2 share a connection with Node 6, forming triangle <1, 2, 6>.
(1, 6) - Nodes 1 and 6 share a connection with Node 2, forming triangle <1, 2, 6>.
(2, 3) - Nodes 2 and 3 share a connection with Node 1, forming triangle <1, 2, 3>.
(3, 5) - No triangles formed.
(3, 6) - Nodes 3 and 6 share a connection with Node 1, forming triangle <1, 3, 6>.
(4, 9) - No triangles formed.
(5, 7) - No triangles formed.
(6, 8) - Nodes 6 and 8 share a connection with Node 1, forming triangle <1, 6, 8>.
(7, 8) - No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 3>, and <1, 6, 8>.
