Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
0 (2 connections), 5 (2 connections), 7 (1 connection), 8 (1 connection), 1 (3 connections), 2 (3 connections), 9 (3 connections), 4 (3 connections), 6 (6 connections), 3 (6 connections).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:
- For edge (0, 4):
  - Both 0 and 4 are connected to 6, forming the triangle <0, 4, 6>.

- For edge (0, 9):
  - Both 0 and 9 are connected to 6, forming the triangle <0, 9, 6>.

- For edge (1, 3):
  - Both 1 and 3 are connected to 6, forming the triangle <1, 3, 6>.

- For edge (1, 6):
  - 1 is connected to 3 and 6, forming the triangle <1, 6, 3>.

- For edge (2, 5):
  - No triangle formed.

- For edge (2, 6):
  - 2 is connected to 6, forming the triangle <2, 6, 3>.

- For edge (3, 8):
  - No triangle formed.

- For edge (3, 7):
  - No triangle formed.

- For edge (3, 8):
  - No triangle formed.

- For edge (3, 6):
  - No triangle formed.

- For edge (4, 6):
  - Both 4 and 6 are connected to 0, forming the triangle <4, 6, 0>.

- For edge (6, 1):
  - No triangle formed.

- For edge (6, 2):
  - No triangle formed.

- For edge (6, 4):
  - 6 is connected to 0 and 4, forming the triangle <6, 4, 0>.

- For edge (6, 9):
  - 6 is connected to 0 and 9, forming the triangle <6, 9, 0>.

- For edge (9, 6):
  - No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
