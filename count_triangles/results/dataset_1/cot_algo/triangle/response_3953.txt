Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
(0: 2), (1: 3), (2: 2), (3: 2), (4: 3), (5: 4), (6: 1), (7: 2), (8: 2), (9: 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <0, 3, 9>
- Edge (1, 5) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 6) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 8: <2, 4, 8>
- Edge (2, 7) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 7) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 8: <2, 4, 8>
- Edge (4, 8) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (5, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <4, 5, 8>
- Edge (6, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 3) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 4) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <4, 5, 8>
- Edge (9, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <0, 3, 9>
- Edge (9, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) doesn't form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, and <4, 5, 8>.
