Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: 3 connections
1: 1 connection
2: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 5 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 2 connections

Now we relabel the vertices accordingly:
1 -> 0
5 -> 1
6 -> 2
9 -> 5
2 -> 3
8 -> 4
3 -> 6
4 -> 7
0 -> 8

Now, based on the sorted vertices and their connections, we consider the edges in the following order:

(1, 4): No triangle.
(5, 8): No triangle.
(6, 4): No triangle.
(9, 4): No triangle.
(3, 6): No triangle.
(8, 2): No triangle.
(3, 2): No triangle.
(8, 3): No triangle.
(4, 2): Triangle formed: <2, 3, 7>.
(0, 8): Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>.
(4, 6): No triangle.
(4, 0): No triangle.
(0, 3): No triangle.
(4, 9): No triangle.
(2, 8): Triangle formed: <4, 3, 6>.
(5, 9): No triangle.
(8, 5): No triangle.
(9, 5): No triangle.
(2, 4): Triangle formed: <3, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 4>, and <3, 6, 7>.
