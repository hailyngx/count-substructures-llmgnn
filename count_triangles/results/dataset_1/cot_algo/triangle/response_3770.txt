Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 1
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 4

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees as follows:
- Node 0 (degree 1) becomes Node 0
- Node 1 (degree 5) becomes Node 1
- Node 2 (degree 3) becomes Node 2
- Node 3 (degree 2) becomes Node 3
- Node 4 (degree 4) becomes Node 4
- Node 5 (degree 2) becomes Node 5
- Node 6 (degree 4) becomes Node 6
- Node 7 (degree 2) becomes Node 7
- Node 8 (degree 2) becomes Node 8
- Node 9 (degree 4) becomes Node 9

Next, we will go through each edge, starting from the one with the node with the lower label, and count the triangles formed by shared connections. 

After going through all the edges, we count a total of 8 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 9>.
