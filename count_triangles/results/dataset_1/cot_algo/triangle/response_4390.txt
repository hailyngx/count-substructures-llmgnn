Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the reordered vertices are: 

1, 3, 4, 7, 6, 5, 9, 8, 2

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections, we can count the triangles in the graph:
[Total number of triangles = 3]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 2, 8> <2, 5, 9> <4, 5, 9>
