Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 5: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 5: 0 connections - relabeled as node 0
Node 1: 1 connection - relabeled as node 1
Node 4: 1 connection - relabeled as node 2
Node 8: 1 connection - relabeled as node 3
Node 0: 3 connections - relabeled as node 4
Node 9: 4 connections - relabeled as node 5
Node 6: 4 connections - relabeled as node 6
Node 3: 4 connections - relabeled as node 7
Node 7: 5 connections - relabeled as node 8
Node 2: 5 connections - relabeled as node 9

Now, let's check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 2) skipped because both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with node 7: <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 5: <0, 4, 5>
- Edge (1, 2) skipped because both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (2, 0) skipped because (0, 2) was skipped earlier.
- Edge (2, 1) skipped because (1, 2) was skipped earlier.
- Edge (2, 3) skipped because both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (3, 2) skipped because (2, 3) was skipped earlier.
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 7: <3, 4, 6>
- Edge (3, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5: <0, 3, 5>
- Edge (4, 3) skipped because (3, 4) was counted earlier.
- Edge (5, 7) is invalid as 5 has a lower label than 7.
- Edge (6, 0) is invalid as 0 has a higher label than 6.
- Edge (6, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5: <0, 6, 5>
- Edge (6, 8) is invalid as 8 has a lower label than 6.
- Edge (6, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7: <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (7, 3) is invalid as 3 has a lower label than 7.
- Edge (7, 5) is invalid as 5 has a lower label than 7.
- Edge (7, 6) is invalid as 6 has a lower label than 7.
- Edge (7, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 6: <0, 7, 6>
- Edge (8, 6) is invalid as 6 has a higher label than 8.
- Edge (9, 0) is invalid as 0 has a higher label than 9.
- Edge (9, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7: <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (9, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 6: <0, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 6, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 9, 6>.
