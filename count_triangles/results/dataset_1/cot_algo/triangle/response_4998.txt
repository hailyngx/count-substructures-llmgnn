Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following order: 

Vertices: 2, 6, 5, 9, 7, 4, 8, 1, 3, 0 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [8] 

Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 8, 9>
