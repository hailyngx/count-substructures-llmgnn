Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Here is the list of vertices with their respective number of connections:

Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 7 connections
Vertex 4: 8 connections

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. Starting from the vertices with the least connections, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

After analyzing the graph, we find the following triangles:
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 4>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
