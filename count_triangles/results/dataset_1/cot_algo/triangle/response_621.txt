Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
Degrees: (3, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5)

Now, we will relabel the vertices as follows:
Vertex 0 has the lowest degree, so it will be relabeled as 0.
Vertex 4 has the next lowest degree, so it will be relabeled as 1.
Vertex 6 has the next lowest degree, so it will be relabeled as 2.
Vertex 2 has the next lowest degree, so it will be relabeled as 3.
Vertex 3 has the next lowest degree, so it will be relabeled as 4.
Vertex 5 has the next lowest degree, so it will be relabeled as 5.
Vertex 1 has the next lowest degree, so it will be relabeled as 6.
Vertex 7 has the next lowest degree, so it will be relabeled as 7.
Vertex 8 has the next lowest degree, so it will be relabeled as 8.
Vertex 9 has the highest degree, so it will be relabeled as 9.

After relabeling, the edges will be as follows: 
(0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7)

Now, we will count the triangles:
- <0, 3, 9>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, and <5, 7, 9>.
