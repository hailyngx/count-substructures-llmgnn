Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new node labels will be: <6, 7, 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9>.

Now, we will only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (0, 5) forms a triangle with node 2: <0, 2, 5>.
- (0, 2) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 5: <0, 1, 2> and <0, 2, 5>.
- (0, 3) does not form a triangle since node 0 has more connections than node 3.
- (0, 1) forms a triangle with node 3: <0, 1, 3>.
- (1, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 8: <1, 3, 4> and <1, 4, 8>.
- (2, 5) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 2, 5>.
- (3, 7) forms a triangle with node 4: <3, 4, 7>.
- (4, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 9: <1, 4, 8> and <4, 8, 9>.
- (5, 0) forms a triangle with node 2: <0, 2, 5>.
- (6, 8) does not form a triangle since node 6 has more connections than node 8.
- (6, 9) does not form a triangle since node 6 has more connections than node 9.
- (7, 3) forms a triangle with node 4: <3, 4, 7>.
- (8, 6) does not form a triangle since node 8 has more connections than node 6.
- (8, 9) does not form a triangle since node 8 has more connections than node 9.
- (9, 6) does not form a triangle since node 9 has more connections than node 6.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 1, 3>, <3, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, and <4, 8, 9>.
