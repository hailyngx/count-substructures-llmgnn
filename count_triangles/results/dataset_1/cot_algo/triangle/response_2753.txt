Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method steps are as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections:
   Node 7: 0 connections
   Nodes 3, 6, 8: 1 connection
   Nodes 1, 4: 2 connections
   Nodes 2, 9: 3 connections
   Nodes 0, 5: 6 connections

2. Relabel the nodes from lowest degree to highest degree:
   Node 7: 0 connections
   Nodes 3, 6, 8: 1 connection
   Nodes 1, 4: 2 connections
   Nodes 2, 9: 3 connections
   Nodes 0, 5: 6 connections

3. Analyze each edge based on the relabeled nodes:
   - (0, 1): Node 0 (6 connections) is higher ranked, proceed.
   - (0, 2): Node 0 (6 connections) is higher ranked, proceed.
   - (0, 3): Node 0 (6 connections) is higher ranked, proceed.
   - (0, 4): Node 0 (6 connections) is higher ranked, proceed.
   - (0, 5): Node 0 (6 connections) is higher ranked, proceed.
   - (0, 9): Node 0 (6 connections) is higher ranked, proceed.
   - (1, 2): Node 1 (2 connections) is higher ranked, proceed.
   - (1, 9): Node 1 (2 connections) is higher ranked, proceed.
   - (2, 5): Node 2 (3 connections) is higher ranked, proceed.
   - (5, 6): Node 5 (6 connections) is higher ranked, proceed.
   - (5, 9): Node 5 (6 connections) is higher ranked, proceed.

4. Count the triangles formed by the shared connections:
   - <0, 1, 2>
   - <0, 1, 9>
   - <0, 2, 5>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
