Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degree in ascending order, we get the following graph:

Vertices:
0 -> degree 0
4 -> degree 1
5 -> degree 1
8 -> degree 1
7 -> degree 2
6 -> degree 2
9 -> degree 3
3 -> degree 4
2 -> degree 4
1 -> degree 8

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (4, 2): No triangle
2. (5, 3): No triangle
3. (8, 1): No triangle
4. (7, 6): Triangle <6, 7, 1>
5. (9, 2): Triangle <2, 9, 1>
6. (9, 3): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <6, 7, 1>, <2, 9, 1>
