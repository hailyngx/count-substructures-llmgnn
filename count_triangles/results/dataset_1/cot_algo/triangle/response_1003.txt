Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes sorted by their degree: 
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 6

Re-labeling the nodes:
Node 5 → 0
Node 8 → 1
Node 9 → 2
Node 7 → 3
Node 4 → 4
Node 2 → 5
Node 6 → 6
Node 1 → 7
Node 3 → 8
Node 0 → 9

After relabeling, the edges are: 
(9, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3)
(7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 4) 
(5, 9) (5, 7)
(8, 9) (8, 6)
(6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4)
(3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6)
(4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6)

The triangles formed are:
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [4]
