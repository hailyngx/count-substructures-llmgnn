Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly. 

Sorted vertices with their corresponding degrees:
0: 2 connections
1: 1 connection
2: 3 connections
5: 2 connections
8: 1 connection
7: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
9: 4 connections
4: 7 connections
3: 6 connections

Now, we can count the number of triangles:
1. Edge (0, 4): Forms triangle <0, 4, 1>.
2. Edge (0, 9): Forms triangle <0, 9, 7>.
3. Edge (1, 4): Does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (2, 3): Forms triangle <2, 3, 4>.
5. Edge (2, 4): Forms triangle <2, 4, 0>.
6. Edge (3, 4): Forms triangle <3, 4, 0>.
7. Edge (3, 5): Does not form a triangle.
8. Edge (3, 6): Does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (4, 0): Does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (4, 1): Does not form a triangle.
11. Edge (4, 2): Does not form a triangle.
12. Edge (4, 3): Does not form a triangle.
13. Edge (4, 8): Does not form a triangle.
14. Edge (5, 3): Does not form a triangle.
15. Edge (5, 7): Forms triangle <5, 7, 9>.
16. Edge (6, 3): Forms triangle <6, 3, 5>.
17. Edge (6, 9): Forms triangle <6, 9, 0>.
18. Edge (7, 5): Does not form a triangle.
19. Edge (7, 9): Forms triangle <7, 9, 0>.
20. Edge (8, 4): Does not form a triangle.
21. Edge (9, 0): Does not form a triangle.
22. Edge (9, 6): Forms triangle <9, 6, 3>.
23. Edge (9, 7): Does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9] in the given graph.
