Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in increasing order, we get the following relabeling: 

Node 1 -> degree 1
Node 5 -> degree 1
Node 8 -> degree 2
Node 7 -> degree 3
Node 6 -> degree 4
Node 3 -> degree 4
Node 2 -> degree 5
Node 4 -> degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 has degree 1 and Node 4 has degree 6. No triangles are formed.
2. Edge (2, 3): Node 2 has degree 5 and Node 3 has degree 4. No triangles are formed.
3. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 has degree 5 and Node 4 has degree 6. Shared connection with Node 3, forming triangle <2, 3, 4>.
4. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 has degree 5 and Node 7 has degree 3. No triangles are formed.
5. Edge (2, 8): Node 2 has degree 5 and Node 8 has degree 2. No triangles are formed.
6. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has degree 4 and Node 4 has degree 6. Shared connection with Node 2, forming triangle <2, 3, 4>.
7. Edge (3, 5): Node 3 has degree 4 and Node 5 has degree 1. No triangles are formed.
8. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 has degree 4 and Node 6 has degree 4. Shared connection with Node 4, forming triangle <3, 4, 6>.
9. Edge (4, 1): Node 4 has degree 6 and Node 1 has degree 1. No triangles are formed.
10. Edge (4, 6): Node 4 has degree 6 and Node 6 has degree 4. Shared connection with Node 3, forming triangle <3, 4, 6>.
11. Edge (5, 3): Node 5 has degree 1 and Node 3 has degree 4. No triangles are formed.
12. Edge (6, 3): Node 6 has degree 4 and Node 3 has degree 4. Shared connection with Node 4, forming triangle <3, 4, 6>.
13. Edge (6, 5): Node 6 has degree 4 and Node 5 has degree 1. No triangles are formed.
14. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 has degree 4 and Node 7 has degree 3. No triangles are formed.
15. Edge (7, 2): Node 7 has degree 3 and Node 2 has degree 5. No triangles are formed.
16. Edge (7, 6): Node 7 has degree 3 and Node 6 has degree 4. No triangles are formed.
17. Edge (7, 8): Node 7 has degree 3 and Node 8 has degree 2. No triangles are formed.
18. Edge (8, 2): Node 8 has degree 2 and Node 2 has degree 5. No triangles are formed.
19. Edge (8, 7): Node 8 has degree 2 and Node 7 has degree 3. No triangles are formed.

Count of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 6>.
