Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
0 - 3 connections
1 - 3 connections
2 - 4 connections
3 - 1 connection
4 - 4 connections
5 - 3 connections
6 - 2 connections
7 - 1 connection
8 - 5 connections
9 - 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through each edge to count the number of triangles formed:

1. Edge (0, 1): Both vertices have 3 connections each. No triangles formed.
2. Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has 3 connections, and vertex 8 has 5 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <0, 4, 8>.
3. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has 3 connections, and vertex 9 has 4 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <0, 4, 9>.
4. Edge (1, 5): Both vertices have 3 connections each. No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has 3 connections, and vertex 8 has 5 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <1, 4, 8>.
6. Edge (2, 3): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (2, 4): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (2, 7): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (3, 2): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (4, 2): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (4, 8): Vertex 4 has 4 connections, and vertex 8 has 5 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <2, 4, 8>.
13. Edge (4, 9): Vertex 4 has 4 connections, and vertex 9 has 4 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <0, 4, 9>.
14. Edge (5, 1): Both vertices have 3 connections each. No triangles formed.
15. Edge (5, 2): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (6, 8): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 has 2 connections, and vertex 9 has 4 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <0, 6, 9>.
18. Edge (7, 2): No triangles formed.
19. Edge (8, 0): Vertex 0 has 3 connections, and vertex 8 has 5 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <0, 4, 8>.
20. Edge (8, 1): Vertex 1 has 3 connections, and vertex 8 has 5 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <1, 4, 8>.
21. Edge (8, 4): Vertex 4 has 4 connections, and vertex 8 has 5 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <2, 4, 8>.
22. Edge (8, 6): No triangles formed.
23. Edge (8, 9): Vertex 8 has 5 connections, and vertex 9 has 4 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <0, 4, 9>.
24. Edge (9, 0): Vertex 0 has 3 connections, and vertex 9 has 4 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <0, 4, 9>.
25. Edge (9, 4): Vertex 4 has 4 connections, and vertex 9 has 4 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <0, 4, 9>.
26. Edge (9, 6): Vertex 6 has 2 connections, and vertex 9 has 4 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <0, 6, 9>.
27. Edge (9, 8): Vertex 8 has 5 connections, and vertex 9 has 4 connections. We check for shared connections and find the triangle <0, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
