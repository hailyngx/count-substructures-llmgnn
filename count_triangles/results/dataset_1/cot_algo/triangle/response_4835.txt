Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 0 has degree 4
- Vertex 3 has degree 3
- Vertices 5 and 8 have degree 2
- Vertices 6 and 2 have degree 5
- Vertices 1 and 5 have degree 6
- Vertex 4 has degree 7
- Vertices 7 and 9 have degree 8

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Now, let's find the triangles formed by the shared connections between vertices:

- Triangle <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle <1, 2, 8>
- Triangle <1, 2, 9>
- Triangle <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle <1, 7, 4>
- Triangle <1, 7, 9>
- Triangle <2, 8, 4>
- Triangle <2, 9, 4>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <4, 7, 9>
- Triangle <4, 8, 7>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
