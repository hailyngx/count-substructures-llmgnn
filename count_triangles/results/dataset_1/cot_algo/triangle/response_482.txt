Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting vertices by degree:
Vertex 6: 0 connections
Vertex 8: 0 connections
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Edge: (0, 1) (Vertex 0 and Vertex 1 both have 4 connections, no triangle)
Edge: (0, 2) (Vertex 0 has 4 connections, Vertex 2 has 5 connections, triangle found: <0, 2, 7>)
Edge: (0, 7) (Vertex 0 has 4 connections, Vertex 7 has 2 connections, no triangle)
Edge: (0, 9) (Vertex 0 has 4 connections, Vertex 9 has 6 connections, triangle found: <0, 1, 9>)
Edge: (1, 2) (Vertex 1 has 4 connections, Vertex 2 has 5 connections, no triangle)
Edge: (1, 5) (Vertex 1 has 4 connections, Vertex 5 has 5 connections, no triangle)
Edge: (1, 9) (Vertex 1 has 4 connections, Vertex 9 has 6 connections, triangle found: <1, 0, 9>)
Edge: (2, 3) (Vertex 2 has 5 connections, Vertex 3 has 1 connection, no triangle)
Edge: (2, 4) (Vertex 2 has 5 connections, Vertex 4 has 5 connections, triangle found: <2, 5, 4>)
Edge: (2, 5) (Vertex 2 has 5 connections, Vertex 5 has 5 connections, triangle found: <2, 1, 5>)
Edge: (2, 7) (Vertex 2 has 5 connections, Vertex 7 has 2 connections, no triangle)
Edge: (4, 5) (Vertex 4 has 5 connections, Vertex 5 has 5 connections, no triangle)
Edge: (4, 7) (Vertex 4 has 5 connections, Vertex 7 has 2 connections, no triangle)
Edge: (4, 9) (Vertex 4 has 5 connections, Vertex 9 has 6 connections, triangle found: <4, 0, 9>)
Edge: (5, 9) (Vertex 5 has 5 connections, Vertex 9 has 6 connections, triangle found: <5, 1, 9>)

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 1, 5>
