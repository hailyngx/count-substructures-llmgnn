Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 8: 0 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices in ascending order based on their degrees:
Node 6 (0 connections) -> Node 0
Node 3 (0 connections) -> Node 1
Node 8 (0 connections) -> Node 2
Node 2 (1 connection) -> Node 3
Node 1 (2 connections) -> Node 4
Node 5 (2 connections) -> Node 5
Node 4 (2 connections) -> Node 6
Node 7 (2 connections) -> Node 7
Node 0 (3 connections) -> Node 8
Node 9 (5 connections) -> Node 9

Now, we will go through each edge in the sorted order and count triangles:
(0, 2): No triangle
(0, 4): No triangle
(0, 9): No triangle
(1, 9): No triangle
(2, 0): No triangle
(4, 0): No triangle
(4, 9): Triangle <0, 4, 9>
(5, 7): No triangle
(7, 5): No triangle
(7, 9): Triangle <7, 9, 0>
(9, 0): No triangle
(9, 1): No triangle
(9, 4): Triangle <9, 4, 0>
(9, 7): Triangle <9, 7, 0>

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 9>, <7, 9, 0>, <9, 4, 0>, <9, 7, 0>
