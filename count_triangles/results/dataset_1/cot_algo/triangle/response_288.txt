Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0: degree 1
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 1
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 5
- Vertex 9: degree 4

Now, let's identify the triangles:
For edge (0, 1):
- Vertex 0 doesn't proceed as it has fewer connections than vertex 1.

For edge (1, 6):
- Vertex 1 proceeds as it has fewer connections than vertex 6.
- Shared connections between vertices 1 and 6 are 7 and 2, forming triangles <1, 7, 2> and <1, 6, 2>.

For edge (1, 7):
- Vertex 1 doesn't proceed as it has more connections than vertex 7.

For edge (2, 4):
- Vertex 2 proceeds as it has fewer connections than vertex 4.
- Shared connection between vertices 2 and 4 is 6, forming triangle <2, 6, 4>.

For edge (2, 5):
- Vertex 2 proceeds as it has fewer connections than vertex 5.
- No shared connections; no triangle formed.

For edge (2, 6):
- Vertex 2 proceeds as it has fewer connections than vertex 6.
- Shared connection between vertices 2 and 6 is 1, forming triangle <2, 6, 1>.

For edge (3, 8):
- Vertex 3 proceeds as it has fewer connections than vertex 8.
- No shared connections; no triangle formed.

For edge (3, 9):
- Vertex 3 proceeds as it has fewer connections than vertex 9.
- No shared connections; no triangle formed.

For edge (6, 8):
- Vertex 6 proceeds as it has fewer connections than vertex 8.
- Shared connection between vertices 6 and 8 is 9, forming triangle <6, 8, 9>.

For edge (6, 9):
- Vertex 6 proceeds as it has fewer connections than vertex 9.
- No shared connections; no triangle formed.

For edge (8, 9):
- Vertex 8 proceeds as it has fewer connections than vertex 9.
- No shared connections; no triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
