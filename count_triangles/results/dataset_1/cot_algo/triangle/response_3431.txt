Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 5: (0 connections) -> relabeled as 0
Vertex 6: (0 connections) -> relabeled as 1
Vertex 0: (1 connection)  -> relabeled as 2
Vertex 2: (1 connection)  -> relabeled as 3
Vertex 1: (2 connections) -> relabeled as 4
Vertex 7: (2 connections) -> relabeled as 5
Vertex 3: (2 connections) -> relabeled as 6
Vertex 8: (3 connections) -> relabeled as 7
Vertex 4: (4 connections) -> relabeled as 8
Vertex 9: (4 connections) -> relabeled as 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we look at each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 9): Both vertices have 0 common connections. No triangle.
- Edge (1, 4): Both vertices have 1 common connection - vertex 3. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 3>.
- Edge (1, 8): Both vertices have 1 common connection - vertex 7. Triangle formed: <1, 8, 7>.
- Edge (2, 8): Both vertices have 0 common connections. No triangle.
- Edge (3, 4): Both vertices have 1 common connection - vertex 7. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 7>.
- Edge (3, 9): Both vertices have 0 common connections. No triangle.
- Edge (4, 1): Both vertices have 1 common connection - vertex 3. Triangle formed: <4, 1, 3>.
- Edge (4, 3): Both vertices have 2 common connections - vertices 1 and 7. Triangle formed: <4, 3, 1>.
- Edge (4, 7): Both vertices have 2 common connections - vertices 1 and 3. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 1>.
- Edge (4, 9): Both vertices have 0 common connections. No triangle.
- Edge (7, 4): Both vertices have 2 common connections - vertices 3 and 1. Triangle formed: <7, 4, 1>.
- Edge (7, 8): Both vertices have 1 common connection - vertex 1. Triangle formed: <7, 8, 1>.
- Edge (8, 1): Both vertices have 1 common connection - vertex 4. Triangle formed: <8, 1, 4>.
- Edge (8, 2): Both vertices have 0 common connections. No triangle.
- Edge (8, 7): Both vertices have 1 common connection - vertex 1. Triangle formed: <8, 7, 1>.
- Edge (9, 0): Both vertices have 0 common connections. No triangle.
- Edge (9, 3): Both vertices have 0 common connections. No triangle.
- Edge (9, 4): Both vertices have 2 common connections - vertices 1 and 7. Triangle formed: <9, 4, 1>.

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [7].
