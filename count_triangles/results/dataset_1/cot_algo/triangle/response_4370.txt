Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labeling based on the number of connections each vertex has is as follows:
Node 0 - degree 3
Node 1 - degree 3
Node 2 - degree 2
Node 3 - degree 2
Node 4 - degree 2
Node 5 - degree 7
Node 6 - degree 2
Node 7 - degree 4
Node 8 - degree 4
Node 9 - degree 2

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will calculate the number of triangles in this graph.

- Looking at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
  - Edge (0, 1): Forms a triangle with Node 5 <0, 1, 5>.
  - Edge (0, 5): No triangles.
  - Edge (0, 8): No triangles.
  - Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle with Node 0 <1, 5, 0>.
  - Edge (1, 8): No triangles.
  - Edge (2, 6): No triangles.
  - Edge (2, 7): No triangles.
  - Edge (3, 5): Forms a triangle with Node 4 <3, 5, 4>.
  - Edge (3, 8): No triangles.
  - Edge (4, 5): No triangles.
  - Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with Node 2 <4, 7, 2>.
  - Edge (5, 6): No triangles.
  - Edge (5, 9): No triangles.
  - Edge (6, 7): No triangles.
  - Edge (7, 9): Forms a triangle with Node 5 <7, 9, 5>.

The total number of triangles is [4].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <1, 5, 0>, <3, 5, 4>, and <4, 7, 2>.
