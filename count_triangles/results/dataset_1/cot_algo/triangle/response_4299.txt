Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 1, 2, 6, 8, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the process of counting triangles yields the following result:
- Triangle <0, 7, 3>
- Triangle <0, 7, 4>
- Triangle <0, 7, 5>
- Triangle <0, 7, 8>
- Triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle <0, 4, 3>
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle <0, 5, 3>
- Triangle <0, 5, 4>
- Triangle <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle <0, 8, 7>
- Triangle <0, 8, 3>
- Triangle <0, 8, 4>
- Triangle <0, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
