Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices: 
0 - degree 1
1 - degree 2
5 - degree 2
8 - degree 1
7 - degree 0
3 - degree 3
6 - degree 3
4 - degree 3
9 - degree 4
2 - degree 5

Using the degree-based ordering, we start with the edges connecting vertices with lower degrees to higher degrees:

1. Edge (0, 3) - Both vertices have lower degrees, so we proceed.
   Shared connections: None
2. Edge (1, 2) - Proceed because vertex 1 has a lower degree than vertex 2.
   Shared connections: None
3. Edge (2, 5) - Proceed because vertex 2 has a lower degree than vertex 5.
   Shared connections: None
4. Edge (3, 6) - Proceed because vertex 3 has a lower degree than vertex 6.
   Shared connections: None
5. Edge (4, 5) - Proceed because vertex 4 has a lower degree than vertex 5.
   Shared connections: None
6. Edge (6, 8) - Proceed because vertex 6 has a lower degree than vertex 8.
   Shared connections: None
7. Edge (9, 1) - Proceed because vertex 1 has a lower degree than vertex 9.
   Shared connections: None
8. Edge (9, 2) - Proceed because vertex 2 has a lower degree than vertex 9.
   Shared connections: None
9. Edge (9, 4) - Proceed because vertex 4 has a lower degree than vertex 9.
   Shared connections: None

Based on the shared connections, we find the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 1]
Unique triangles: <2, 4, 9>
