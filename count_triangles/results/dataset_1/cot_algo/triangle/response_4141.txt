Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Vertices sorted based on their degree:
Vertices: 8, 1, 5, 6, 9, 0, 7, 3, 2, 4
Edges:
(8, 0), (1, 0), (5, 1), (6, 2), (9, 4), (0, 2), (7, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 7), (4, 9), (2, 5), (3, 6), (7, 9)
Triangles:
[10]
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 2>, <2, 6, 3>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 9, 7>, <5, 2, 0>, <7, 3, 6>
