Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
Reordering vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 9, 3, 5, 6, 9, 2, 2, 5, 2, 4
Degrees: 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4

Edges with lower degree vertex first: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 8)

Calculating triangles formed by shared connections:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 2, 7>
- Triangle 4: <0, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [4]
