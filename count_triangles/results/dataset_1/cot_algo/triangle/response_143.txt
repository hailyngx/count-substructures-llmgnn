Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph, after sorting the vertices based on their degrees, can be represented as follows:
Vertices: 1, 6, 9, 5, 3, 7, 0, 4, 8, 2

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 0, 5>
<4, 8, 5>
