Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we can relabel the vertices as follows:
- Node 0 has 2 connections
- Node 1 has 2 connections
- Node 8 has 1 connection
- Node 9 has 1 connection
- Node 4 has 2 connections
- Node 5 has 3 connections
- Node 7 has 3 connections
- Node 3 has 4 connections
- Node 2 has 4 connections
- Node 6 has 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 6): Node 0 and Node 6 share 2 mutual connections (Node 7 and Node 1). So, there is 1 triangle <0, 6, 1>.

2. Edge (0, 7): Node 0 and Node 7 share no mutual connections.

3. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 and Node 2 share 1 mutual connection (Node 6). So, there is 1 triangle <1, 2, 6>.

4. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 and Node 6 share 1 mutual connection (Node 2). So, there is 1 triangle <1, 6, 2>.

5. Edge (2, 3): Node 2 and Node 3 share 2 mutual connections (Node 6 and Node 1). So, there are 2 triangles <2, 3, 6> and <2, 3, 1>.

6. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 and Node 4 share no mutual connections.

7. Edge (3, 5): Node 3 and Node 5 share 2 mutual connections (Node 6 and Node 7). So, there is 1 triangle <3, 5, 6>.

8. Edge (3, 9): Node 3 and Node 9 share no mutual connections.

9. Edge (4, 7): Node 4 and Node 7 share no mutual connections.

10. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 and Node 6 share 2 mutual connections (Node 7 and Node 0). So, there is 1 triangle <5, 6, 7>.

11. Edge (5, 7): Node 5 and Node 7 share 1 mutual connection (Node 6). So, there is 1 triangle <5, 7, 6>.

12. Edge (6, 8): Node 6 and Node 8 share no mutual connections.

The total number of triangles is [8] inside brackets.
