Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices can be relabeled according to their number of connections in ascending order: 

Vertices: 
1. 5 connections: 6
2. 4 connections: 0, 3, 7
3. 3 connections: 4, 9
4. 2 connections: 2
5. 1 connection: 1, 8

Considering the edges in ascending order of the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections, we find the following triangles:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <0, 4, 6>
5. <0, 6, 9>
6. <3, 6, 9>
7. <3, 7, 9>
8. <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
