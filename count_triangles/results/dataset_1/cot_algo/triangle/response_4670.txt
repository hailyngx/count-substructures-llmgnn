Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph with vertices sorted by the number of connections is as follows:
Vertices: 3, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the graph are:
[13]

The unique triangles found are: <1, 4, 7>
