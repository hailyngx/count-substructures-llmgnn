Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 1, 3, 6, 8 - (degree 1)
Vertices: 4, 9 - (degree 2)
Vertices: 5 - (degree 3)
Vertices: 0, 7 - (degree 4)
Vertices: 2 - (degree 5)

Using the degree-based ordering method, we count the triangles as follows:

Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5> (Shared connection: 2)
Triangle 2: <0, 4, 7> (Shared connection: 4)

The total number of triangles is [2].
