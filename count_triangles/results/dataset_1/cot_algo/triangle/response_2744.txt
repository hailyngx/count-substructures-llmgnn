Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, we have the following order: <4, 7, 8, 9, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 0>.

Now, counting the triangles:

For edge (0, 3):
- Vertices 3 and 0 share connections with 1 and 2.
- Therefore, a triangle is formed: <0, 2, 3>.

For edge (0, 6):
- Vertices 0 and 6 share a connection with 5.
- Therefore, a triangle is formed: <0, 5, 6>.

For edge (0, 9):
- Vertex 0 has no connections shared with vertex 9.

For edge (1, 3):
- Vertices 3 and 1 share a connection with 2.
- Therefore, a triangle is formed: <1, 2, 3>.

For edge (1, 4):
- Vertex 1 has no connections shared with vertex 4.

For edge (1, 5):
- Vertex 1 has no connections shared with vertex 5.

For edge (1, 7):
- Vertex 1 has a connection shared with 2 and 3.
- Therefore, a triangle is formed: <1, 2, 3>.

For edge (2, 3):
- Vertex 2 has no connections shared with vertex 3.

For edge (2, 7):
- Vertex 2 has a connection shared with 1.
- Therefore, a triangle is formed: <2, 1, 7>.

For edge (3, 5):
- Vertex 3 and 5 share a connection with 1.
- Therefore, a triangle is formed: <3, 1, 5>.

For edge (3, 5):
- Vertex 3 and 5 share a connection with 1.
- Therefore, a triangle is formed: <3, 1, 5>.

For edge (5, 6):
- Vertex 5 has no connections shared with vertex 6.

For edge (6, 8):
- Vertex 6 has no connections shared with vertex 8.

Counting the total number of unique triangles found: [6].
