Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on the number of connections:

Node 4: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Now, looking at the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections, we can check for triangles:

- Edge (0, 6): Forms a triangle with node 9: <0, 6, 9>
- Edge (0, 1): No triangles
- Edge (0, 2): No triangles
- Edge (0, 5): No triangles
- Edge (0, 9): No triangles
- Edge (1, 2): No triangles
- Edge (2, 3): No triangles
- Edge (2, 7): No triangles
- Edge (3, 5): No triangles
- Edge (4, 9): No triangles
- Edge (6, 7): Forms a triangle with node 8: <6, 7, 8>
- Edge (6, 8): No triangles
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 6, 9> and <6, 7, 8>.
