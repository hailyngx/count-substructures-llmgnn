Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding degrees are:
Node 0: 1
Node 2: 2
Node 3: 2
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 1
Node 7: 1
Node 9: 2
Node 4: 5

Relabeling the nodes based on the degrees:
Node 0 -> 1
Node 5 -> 2
Node 6 -> 3
Node 7 -> 4
Node 3 -> 5
Node 2 -> 6
Node 9 -> 7
Node 4 -> 8

Now, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

- (0, 4) doesn't form a triangle.
- (2, 6) doesn't form a triangle.
- (2, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
- (3, 4) forms a triangle <3, 4, 5>.
- (3, 5) forms a triangle <3, 4, 5>.
- (4, 0) doesn't form a triangle.
- (4, 3) forms a triangle <3, 4, 5>.
- (4, 7) doesn't form a triangle.
- (4, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
- (5, 3) forms a triangle <3, 4, 5>.
- (6, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
- (7, 4) doesn't form a triangle.
- (9, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
- (9, 4) doesn't form a triangle.

Count of triangles = 1

The total number of triangles is [1].
The unique triangles found are <3, 4, 5>.
