Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices with their respective degrees are:
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 4 connections

Relabeled vertices based on their degree:
Vertex 0 -> 8
Vertex 1 -> 8
Vertex 2 -> 6
Vertex 3 -> 8
Vertex 4 -> 8
Vertex 5 -> 8
Vertex 6 -> 8
Vertex 7 -> 8
Vertex 8 -> 9
Vertex 9 -> 6

Now we go through the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
(0, 4) - No triangle
(1, 2) - No triangle
(1, 6) - No triangle
(2, 5) - Triangle: <2, 5, 9>
(3, 7) - No triangle
(3, 9) - No triangle
(4, 8) - No triangle
(5, 9) - Triangle: <2, 5, 9>
(6, 9) - Triangle: <1, 6, 9>
(7, 2) - No triangle

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <2, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 9>
