Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9, 5, 8, 1, 3, 4

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degree order:

0 → 0 (degree: 2)
2 → 1 (degree: 2)
6 → 2 (degree: 2)
7 → 3 (degree: 5)
9 → 4 (degree: 4)
5 → 5 (degree: 4)
8 → 6 (degree: 3)
1 → 7 (degree: 5)
3 → 8 (degree: 4)
4 → 9 (degree: 4)

Now, let's count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 7) connects vertices 0 and 3 but has to be skipped since 0 has fewer connections.
- Edge (1, 3) connects vertices 7 and 8. Shared connections: 5.
- Edge (1, 4) connects vertices 7 and 9. Shared connections: 5.
- Edge (1, 5) connects vertices 7 and 5. Shared connections: No triangle.
- Edge (1, 9) connects vertices 7 and 4. Shared connections: 5.
- Edge (3, 1) connects vertices 8 and 7. Shared connections: 5.
- Edge (3, 5) connects vertices 8 and 5. Shared connections: No triangle.
- Edge (3, 6) connects vertices 8 and 2. Shared connections: No triangle.
- Edge (4, 1) connects vertices 9 and 7. Shared connections: 5.
- Edge (4, 7) connects vertices 9 and 3. Shared connections: 5.
- Edge (4, 9) connects vertices 9 and 4. Shared connections: 1, 5.
- Edge (5, 1) connects vertices 5 and 7. Shared connections: No triangle.
- Edge (5, 3) connects vertices 5 and 8. Shared connections: No triangle.
- Edge (5, 8) connects vertices 5 and 6. Shared connections: No triangle.
- Edge (6, 3) connects vertices 2 and 8. Shared connections: No triangle.
- Edge (7, 0) connects vertices 3 and 0. Shared connections: No triangle.
- Edge (7, 4) connects vertices 3 and 9. Shared connections: 5.
- Edge (7, 8) connects vertices 3 and 6. Shared connections: No triangle.
- Edge (8, 5) connects vertices 6 and 5. Shared connections: No triangle.
- Edge (8, 7) connects vertices 6 and 3. Shared connections: No triangle.
- Edge (9, 1) connects vertices 4 and 7. Shared connections: 5.
- Edge (9, 4) connects vertices 4 and 9. Shared connections: 5.

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles: <4, 1, 9>, <4, 9, 7>, <1, 4, 9>
