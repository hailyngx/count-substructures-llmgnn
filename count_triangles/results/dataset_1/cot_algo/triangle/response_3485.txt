Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 3, 1, 6, 4, 2, 5, 7, 8, 0, 9.

The unique triangles in the graph are as follows:
<2, 1, 7>
<4, 3, 0>
<4, 5, 7>
<8, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
