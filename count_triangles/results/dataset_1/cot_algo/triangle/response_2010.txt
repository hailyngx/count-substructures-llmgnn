Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, re-labeling the vertices according to this sorting.

The vertices are re-labeled as follows:
Node 0: 7 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Now, we go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:
- Edge (0, 1): Node 0 has a connection with Node 1. We check shared connections and find a triangle with Node 2 (0, 1, 2).
- Edge (0, 2): Node 0 has a connection with Node 2. We check shared connections and find a triangle with Node 1 (0, 2, 1).
- Edge (0, 7): Node 0 has a connection with Node 7. We check shared connections and find a triangle with Node 1 (0, 7, 1).
- Edge (0, 9): Node 0 has a connection with Node 9, but no triangles are formed.
- Edge (1, 2): Node 1 has a connection with Node 2. We check shared connections and find a triangle with Node 0 (1, 2, 0).
- Edge (1, 6): Node 1 has a connection with Node 6. We check shared connections and find a triangle with Node 7 (1, 6, 7).
- Edge (1, 7): Node 1 has a connection with Node 7. We check shared connections and find a triangle with Node 0 (1, 7, 0).
- Edge (2, 3): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (2, 4): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (2, 7): Node 2 has a connection with Node 7. We check shared connections and find a triangle with Node 0 (2, 7, 0).
- Edge (2, 8): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (3, 2): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (4, 2): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (6, 1): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (6, 7): Node 6 has a connection with Node 7. We check shared connections and find a triangle with Node 1 (6, 7, 1).
- Edge (6, 8): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (7, 0): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (7, 1): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (7, 2): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (7, 6): Node 7 has a connection with Node 6. We check shared connections and find a triangle with Node 1 (7, 6, 1).
- Edge (8, 2): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (8, 6): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (9, 0): No triangles are formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 7, 1>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 0>
