Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 3: degree 1
Nodes 1 and 7: degree 2
Nodes 4 and 5: degree 3
Nodes 0 and 3: degree 4
Nodes 2 and 6: degree 6

Relabeling the nodes:
Node 3 → 0
Nodes 1 and 7 → 1
Nodes 4 and 5 → 2
Nodes 0 and 3 → 3
Nodes 2 and 6 → 4

Now we will list the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
(0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 7)

Calculating the number of triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4> formed by connections (0, 2), (0, 4), and (2, 4)
- Triangle <0, 5, 6> formed by connections (0, 5), (0, 6), and (5, 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
