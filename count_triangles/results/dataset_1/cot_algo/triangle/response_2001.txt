Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After rearranging the nodes based on their degrees, the new ordering is: 

Node 5 : 2 edge(s) 
Node 9 : 3 edge(s) 
Node 0 : 3 edge(s) 
Node 4 : 3 edge(s) 
Node 1 : 3 edge(s) 
Node 2 : 3 edge(s) 
Node 6 : 4 edge(s) 
Node 3 : 4 edge(s) 
Node 7 : 5 edge(s) 

Now, we can start counting the triangles. 

There are 3 triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
