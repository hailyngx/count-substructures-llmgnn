Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 2

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 1 (degree 1) becomes 0
- Node 7 (degree 1) becomes 1
- Node 0 (degree 2) becomes 2
- Node 9 (degree 2) becomes 3
- Node 6 (degree 3) becomes 4
- Node 3 (degree 4) becomes 5
- Node 4 (degree 4) becomes 6
- Node 2 (degree 5) becomes 7
- Node 5 (degree 5) becomes 8
- Node 8 (degree 5) becomes 9

The new edges in the relabeled graph based on their new node numbers:
- (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 3) (4, 7) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (9, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Triangle <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle <5, 6, 7>
- Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
