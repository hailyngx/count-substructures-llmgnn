Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are:  

Node 3: 0 connections  
Node 9: 1 connection  
Node 0: 2 connections  
Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 4: 5 connections  
Node 6: 5 connections  
Node 7: 6 connections  
Node 8: 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following triangles:  
[Total number of triangles: 6]  
<3, 4, 6>  
<3, 4, 8>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 6, 8>  
<4, 7, 8>  
<6, 7, 8>
