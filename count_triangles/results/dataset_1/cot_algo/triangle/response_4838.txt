Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 7
- Node 3: degree 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found in the graph are:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 9
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 8
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 7
- Node 3, Node 5, Node 9
- Node 4, Node 7, Node 9

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 2, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 9>.
