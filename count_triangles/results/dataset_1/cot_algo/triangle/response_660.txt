Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degree:
1. Vertices with 2 connections: 3, 4
2. Vertices with 3 connections: 0, 5, 7, 8, 9
3. Vertices with 4 connections: 1, 2, 6

Now we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Label 3 as A, 4 as B
- Label 0 as C, 5 as D, 7 as E, 8 as F, 9 as G
- Label 1 as H, 2 as I, 6 as J

Next, we will identify the triangles using the given edges:
- A (3) has 2 connections with 6 (J) and 8 (F), forming triangle <3, 6, 8>
- B (4) has 2 connections with 6 (J) and 3 (A), forming triangle <4, 6, 3>

Counting the total number of triangles, we have found 2 triangles.

Therefore, the output is [2] once we've listed the unique triangles found as <3, 6, 8> and <4, 6, 3>.
