Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we observe the following triangles:
- Triangle <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
