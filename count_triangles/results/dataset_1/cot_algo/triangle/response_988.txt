Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Degrees: 2 3 3 4 5 1 4 3 1 4

Sorted vertices: 5 8 0 9 1 7 3 6 2 4

Based on the sorted vertices, the edges we will consider are: (0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 6), (4, 7), (6, 7), (6, 9)

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. (0, 5): No triangles
2. (0, 9): No triangles
3. (1, 3): No triangles
4. (1, 6): Triangle <1, 3, 6>
5. (1, 7): No triangles
6. (2, 3): No triangles
7. (2, 4): No triangles
8. (3, 4): No triangles
9. (4, 6): Triangle <3, 4, 6>
10. (4, 7): No triangles
11. (6, 7): No triangles
12. (6, 9): Triangle <3, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 9>
