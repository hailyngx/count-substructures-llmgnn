Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabelling them accordingly, the new ordering of the vertices are: 

Vertex 0 has 4 connections  
Vertex 2 has 2 connections  
Vertex 3 has 2 connections  
Vertex 5 has 2 connections  
Vertex 6 has 1 connection  
Vertex 9 has 2 connections  
Vertex 1 has 3 connections  
Vertex 4 has 4 connections  
Vertex 7 has 4 connections  
Vertex 8 has 2 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we focus on the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Examining the edges, we can count the triangles: 
- For edge (0, 1): shared connection with vertex 7 forms a triangle <0, 1, 7>
- For edge (0, 4): shared connection with vertex 7 forms a triangle <0, 4, 7>
- For edge (0, 6): no triangle formed
- For edge (0, 7): shared connection with vertices 1 and 4 forms triangles <0, 1, 7> and <0, 4, 7>
- For edge (1, 3): no triangle formed
- For edge (1, 7): shared connection with vertices 0 and 4 forms triangles <0, 1, 7> and <1, 4, 7>
- For edge (2, 8): no triangle formed
- For edge (2, 9): no triangle formed
- For edge (3, 4): shared connection with vertex 1 forms a triangle <1, 3, 4>
- For edge (4, 5): no triangle formed
- For edge (5, 7): no triangle formed
- For edge (7, 5): no triangle formed
- For edge (8, 9): no triangle formed
