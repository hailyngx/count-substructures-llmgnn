Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking only the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we find the triangles formed by shared connections:
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle <1, 5, 6>
- Triangle <2, 8, 9>
- Triangle <4, 8, 9>
- Triangle <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
