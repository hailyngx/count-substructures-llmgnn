Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 4: 0 connections  
Node 6: 1 connection  
Node 7: 1 connection  
Node 9: 3 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 8: 5 connections  
Node 5: 5 connections  
Node 3: 5 connections  
Node 0: 6 connections  
Node 2: 6 connections  

Next, we examine the edges by starting from the edge with the vertex of lower label and fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 share Node 5 as a common connection, forming triangle <0, 2, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 3): Node 0 and Node 3 share no common connection.
3. Edge (0, 5): Node 0 and Node 5 share Node 2 as a common connection, forming triangle <0, 2, 5>.
4. Edge (0, 8): Node 0 and Node 8 share Node 2 as a common connection, forming triangle <0, 2, 8>.
5. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 and Node 5 share no common connection.
6. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 and Node 9 share Node 5 as a common connection, forming triangle <1, 5, 9>.
7. Edge (2, 5): Node 2 and Node 5 share no common connection.
8. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 and Node 6 share no common connection.
9. Edge (7, 2): Node 2 and Node 7 share no common connection.
10. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 and Node 9 share Node 5 as a common connection, forming triangle <8, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
