Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 7, 8, 1, 2, 5, 6, 4, 3, 9, 0.

Now, we will process the edges based on the vertices' labels and count the number of triangles:
- Edge (7, 9) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 1) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 0) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 3) will form a triangle: <2, 3, 0>.
- Edge (9, 7) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 1) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 3) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 4) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 5) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 6) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 9) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 1) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 2) will form a triangle: <3, 2, 0>.
- Edge (3, 4) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 5) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 0) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 3) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 0) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 3) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 0) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 4) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) won't form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) won't form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <2, 3, 0> and <3, 2, 0>.
