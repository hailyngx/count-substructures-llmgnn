Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for each vertex are:  
Node 0 : Degree 2  
Node 1 : Degree 2  
Node 2 : Degree 3  
Node 3 : Degree 6  
Node 4 : Degree 4  
Node 5 : Degree 1  
Node 6 : Degree 4  
Node 7 : Degree 4  
Node 8 : Degree 1  
Node 9 : Degree 4  

Now, we can begin counting the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method.  

Counting triangles:  
- (0, 3): Shared connections with 7  
- (0, 7): Shared connections with 3  
- (1, 3): Shared connections with 4  
- (1, 4): Shared connections with 3  
- (2, 3): Shared connections with 6, 4  
- (2, 4): Shared connections with 3  
- (2, 6): Shared connections with 3  
- (3, 0): Shared connections with 7  
- (3, 1): Shared connections with 4  
- (3, 2): Shared connections with 6, 4  
- (3, 4): Shared connections with 1, 2  
- (3, 6): Shared connections with 2  
- (3, 9): Shared connections with 6  
- (4, 1): Shared connections with 3  
- (4, 2): Shared connections with 3  
- (4, 3): Shared connections with 1, 2  
- (4, 7): Shared connections with 6  
- (5, 9): No triangle  
- (6, 2): Shared connections with 3  
- (6, 3): Shared connections with 2  
- (6, 7): Shared connections with 4  
- (6, 9): Shared connections with 3  
- (7, 0): Shared connections with 3  
- (7, 4): Shared connections with 6  
- (7, 6): Shared connections with 4  
- (7, 8): No triangle  
- (8, 7): No triangle  
- (9, 3): Shared connections with 6  
- (9, 5): No triangle  
- (9, 6): Shared connections with 3  

There are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.  

The unique triangles found are:  
<3, 0, 7>  
<3, 1, 4>  
<3, 2, 6>  
<3, 2, 4>  
<3, 6, 9>  
<4, 7, 6>  
<6, 2, 3>  
<6, 9, 3>  
<7, 0, 3>
