Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 5 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 1, 3, 9 have 1 connection each.
- Nodes 4, 7, 8 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 0 and 6 have 7 connections each.
- Node 2 has 4 connections.

Checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
