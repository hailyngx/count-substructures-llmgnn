Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
7: 3 connections
3: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
2: 1 connection
6: 1 connection
8: 1 connection

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

2: 0 connections
6: 1 connection
8: 2 connections
9: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
3: 5 connections
7: 6 connections
1: 7 connections
4: 8 connections
0: 9 connections

Next, we will examine each edge and count the number of triangles:

(0, 5): Forms a triangle with 4 since 4 is connected to both 0 and 5. Triangle: <0, 4, 5>
(0, 8): No triangle formed.
(0, 9): Forms a triangle with 7 since 7 is connected to both 0 and 9. Triangle: <0, 7, 9>
(1, 3): No triangle formed.
(1, 4): Forms a triangle with 7 since 7 is connected to both 1 and 4. Triangle: <1, 4, 7>
(1, 7): Forms a triangle with 4 since 4 is connected to both 1 and 7. Triangle: <1, 4, 7>
(2, 4): No triangle formed.
(3, 1): No triangle formed.
(3, 6): No triangle formed.
(4, 1): No triangle formed.
(4, 2): No triangle formed.
(4, 5): No triangle formed.
(4, 7): Forms a triangle with 1 since 1 is connected to both 4 and 7. Triangle: <1, 4, 7>
(5, 0): Forms a triangle with 4 since 4 is connected to both 0 and 5. Triangle: <0, 4, 5>
(5, 4): No triangle formed.
(6, 3): No triangle formed.
(7, 1): No triangle formed.
(7, 4): Forms a triangle with 1 since 1 is connected to both 4 and 7. Triangle: <1, 4, 7>
(7, 9): Forms a triangle with 0 since 0 is connected to both 7 and 9. Triangle: <0, 7, 9>
(8, 0): No triangle formed.
(9, 0): Forms a triangle with 7 since 7 is connected to both 0 and 9. Triangle: <0, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 7>.
