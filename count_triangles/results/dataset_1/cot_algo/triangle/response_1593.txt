Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 -- 1 -- 4
      |    |
      5 -- 9
      |
      8
      |
      7
      |
      2
```

Now, we will reorder the nodes based on their degree:
- Node 0: Degree 1
- Node 2: Degree 1
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. We will go through each edge and check for triangles:
1. (0, 1) -> No triangle
2. (1, 4) -> Triangle: <1, 4, 9>
3. (1, 5) -> No triangle
4. (1, 9) -> Triangle: <1, 4, 9>
5. (2, 7) -> No triangle
6. (4, 9) -> Triangle: <1, 4, 9>
7. (5, 8) -> No triangle
8. (5, 9) -> Triangle: <1, 5, 9> and <4, 5, 9>
9. (7, 8) -> No triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>.
