Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 6 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 4 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections

Now, let's sort the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order:
1. Vertex 1 with 1 connection
2. Vertex 2 with 1 connection
3. Vertex 0 with 2 connections
4. Vertex 3 with 2 connections
5. Vertex 4 with 2 connections
6. Vertex 7 with 2 connections
7. Vertex 9 with 2 connections
8. Vertex 5 with 4 connections
9. Vertex 8 with 4 connections
10. Vertex 6 with 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

1. Edge: (1, 6)
    - No triangles formed.

2. Edge: (1, 6)
    - No triangles formed.

3. Edge: (0, 5)
    - Triangle <0, 5, 6>.

4. Edge: (2, 8)
    - No triangles formed.

5. Edge: (3, 7)
    - No triangles formed.

6. Edge: (3, 8)
    - No triangles formed.

7. Edge: (4, 6)
    - Triangle <4, 6, 5>.

8. Edge: (4, 9)
    - Triangle <4, 9, 0>.

9. Edge: (0, 5)
    - Triangle <0, 5, 6>.

10. Edge: (5, 6)
    - Triangle <5, 6, 4>.

11. Edge: (5, 7)
    - Triangle <5, 7, 3>.

12. Edge: (6, 1)
    - No triangles formed.

12. Edge: (6, 4)
    - Triangle <6, 4, 9>.
    - Triangle <6, 4, 5>.

14. Edge: (6, 5)
    - Triangle <6, 5, 0>.
    - Triangle <6, 5, 4>.

15. Edge: (6, 8)
    - Triangle <6, 8, 3>.

16. Edge: (7, 3)
    - Triangle <7, 3, 8>.

17. Edge: (7, 5)
    - Triangle <7, 5, 0>.

18. Edge: (8, 2)
    - No triangles formed.

19. Edge: (8, 3)
    - Triangle <8, 3, 7>.

20. Edge: (8, 6)
    - Triangle <8, 6, 5>.
    - Triangle <8, 6, 7>.

21. Edge: (9, 0)
    - Triangle <9, 0, 5>.

22. Edge: (9, 4)
    - Triangle <9, 4, 6>.
    - Triangle <9, 4, 5>.

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [16]
We found the following unique triangles: <0, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 9, 0>, <5, 6, 4>, <5, 7, 3>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 4, 5>, <6, 5, 0>, <6, 8, 3>, <7, 3, 8>, <7, 5, 0>, <8, 3, 7>, <8, 6, 5>, <8, 6, 7>, <9, 0, 5>, <9, 4, 6>.
