Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting the number of triangles in this graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0: Degree 3
- Vertex 1: Degree 4
- Vertex 2: Degree 4
- Vertex 3: Degree 6
- Vertex 4: Degree 4
- Vertex 5: Degree 4
- Vertex 6: Degree 3
- Vertex 7: Degree 2
- Vertex 8: Degree 5
- Vertex 9: Degree 3

2. Relabel the vertices:
- Vertex 7: 0
- Vertex 0: 1
- Vertex 6: 2
- Vertex 9: 3
- Vertex 2: 4
- Vertex 1: 5
- Vertex 5: 6
- Vertex 4: 7
- Vertex 8: 8
- Vertex 3: 9

3. Count the triangles:
- Triangle <5, 1, 0>
- Triangle <5, 1, 3>
- Triangle <5, 1, 8>
- Triangle <5, 3, 0>
- Triangle <5, 3, 2>
- Triangle <5, 4, 8>
- Triangle <2, 0, 1>
- Triangle <2, 0, 3>
- Triangle <2, 0, 8>
- Triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle <2, 3, 7>
- Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle <4, 8, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 13]
