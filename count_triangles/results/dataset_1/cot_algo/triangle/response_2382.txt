Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, then relabeling the vertices accordingly. The vertices will be relabeled as follows:

Vertex 0 has degree 3.
Vertex 3 has degree 1.
Vertex 5 has degree 2.
Vertex 9 has degree 2.
Vertex 2 has degree 2.
Vertex 4 has degree 3.
Vertex 6 has degree 3.
Vertex 1 has degree 4.
Vertex 7 has degree 4.
Vertex 8 has degree 4.

Following the rule to only consider an edge if the vertex with the smaller label has fewer connections, we will analyze the edges:

1. Edge (0, 2) [Node 0 < Node 2]:
Shared connections of Node 0 and Node 2: {6, 8}
Triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>

2. Edge (0, 6) [Node 0 < Node 6]:
Shared connections of Node 0 and Node 6: {1}
Triangle: <0, 6, 1>

3. Edge (0, 8) [Node 0 < Node 8]:
Shared connections of Node 0 and Node 8: {1}
Triangle: <0, 8, 1>

4. Edge (1, 4) [Node 1 < Node 4]:
Shared connections of Node 1 and Node 4: {6}
Triangle: <1, 4, 6>

5. Edge (1, 6) [Node 1 = Node 6; Skip as both have the same label]

6. Edge (1, 8) [Node 1 < Node 8]:
Shared connections of Node 1 and Node 8: {0}
Triangle: <1, 8, 0>

7. Edge (1, 9) [Node 1 < Node 9]:
Shared connections of Node 1 and Node 9: {}
No triangle.

8. Edge (4, 5) [Node 4 < Node 5]:
Shared connections of Node 4 and Node 5: {}
No triangle.

9. Edge (5, 8) [Node 5 < Node 8]:
Shared connections of Node 5 and Node 8: {}
No triangle.

10. Edge (6, 7) [Node 6 < Node 7]:
Shared connections of Node 6 and Node 7: {}
No triangle.

11. Edge (7, 2) [Node 2 < Node 7]:
Shared connections of Node 2 and Node 7: {}
No triangle.

12. Edge (8, 7) [Node 7 < Node 8]:
Shared connections of Node 7 and Node 8: {}
No triangle.

The triangles found are: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 8, 1>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 8, 0>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
