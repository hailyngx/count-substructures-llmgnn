Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 6: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 9: degree 5

Using the degree-based ordering, we will examine the edges in the following order:
(0, 1), (0, 9), (1, 9), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 9), (8, 4)

By analyzing the shared connections, we find the triangles:
<0, 1, 9>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
