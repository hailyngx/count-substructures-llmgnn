Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 2

Now, we will reorder the nodes based on their degrees: 
- Node 1 and Node 7 (degree 1) will have labels 0 and 1
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9 (degree 2) will have labels 2, 3, 4, and 5
- Node 0, Node 2, and Node 8 (degree 3) will have labels 6, 7, and 8
- Node 6 (degree 5) will have label 9

The graph with the new labels is as follows:
- (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
- There are 4 triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
