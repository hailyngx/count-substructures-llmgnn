Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

0: 1
1: 0
2: 2
3: 4
4: 3
5: 3
6: 4
7: 2
8: 3
9: 2

Now, we can start counting the triangles. Since the vertex with the lower label will have fewer connections, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
