Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Then, the vertices are relabeled accordingly. 

The sorted vertices are:  
Vertex 1: 1 connection  
Vertex 0: 2 connections  
Vertex 8: 2 connections  
Vertex 7: 2 connections  
Vertex 4: 2 connections  
Vertex 3: 2 connections  
Vertex 6: 3 connections  
Vertex 9: 4 connections  
Vertex 2: 4 connections  
Vertex 5: 8 connections  

Now, we will go through the edges based on the lowest labeled vertex having fewer connections than the other vertex:

For edge (1, 9): Proceed
For edge (0, 7): Proceed
For edge (2, 3): Proceed
For edge (2, 4): Proceed
For edge (2, 5): Proceed
For edge (3, 5): Proceed
For edge (4, 5): Proceed
For edge (5, 6): Proceed
For edge (7, 5): Proceed
For edge (8, 6): Proceed
For edge (9, 6): Proceed
For edge (9, 5): Proceed

The total number of triangles is [8]  
The unique triangles are:  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 5, 7>  
<0, 5, 9>  
<2, 3, 5>  
<2, 4, 5>  
<2, 5, 6>  
<5, 6, 9>  
<5, 7, 9>
