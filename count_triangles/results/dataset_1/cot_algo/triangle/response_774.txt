Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their degree are: 

Vertices: 1 -> 7 -> 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 9 -> 6 -> 8 -> 2

Based on their labels, the unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
