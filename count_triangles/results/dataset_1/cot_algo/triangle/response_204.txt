Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most connections, the new vertex order is: 3, 5, 2, 9, 7, 5, 0, 6, 1, 8.

Now, we will examine each edge in the order specified:

1. Edge (0, 4): Both vertices have common neighbors 6 and 8, forming the triangle <0, 4, 6>.
2. Edge (0, 6): Both vertices have a common neighbor 8, forming the triangle <0, 6, 8>.
3. Edge (0, 8): Both vertices have a common neighbor 4 and 6, forming the triangle <0, 8, 4>.
4. Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed as the conditions are not met.
5. Edge (1, 6): No triangles formed as the conditions are not met.
6. Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed as the conditions are not met.
7. Edge (1, 8): Both vertices have a common neighbor 0 and 6, forming the triangle <1, 8, 0>.
8. Edge (2, 1): No triangles formed as the conditions are not met.
9. Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed as the conditions are not met.
10. Edge (4, 0): Triangle already counted.
11. Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed as the conditions are not met.
12. Edge (4, 7): No triangles formed as the conditions are not met.
13. Edge (4, 8): Triangle already counted.
14. Edge (5, 4): No triangles formed as the conditions are not met.
15. Edge (6, 0): Triangle already counted.
16. Edge (6, 1): Triangle already counted.
17. Edge (6, 8): Triangle already counted.
18. Edge (7, 1): No triangles formed as the conditions are not met.
19. Edge (7, 4): No triangles formed as the conditions are not met.
20. Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed as the conditions are not met.
21. Edge (8, 0): Triangle already counted.
22. Edge (8, 1): Triangle already counted.
23. Edge (8, 4): Triangle already counted.
24. Edge (8, 6): Triangle already counted.
25. Edge (9, 3): No triangles formed as the conditions are not met.
26. Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed as the conditions are not met.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles are <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, and <0, 8, 4>.
