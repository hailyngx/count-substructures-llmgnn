Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Reorder the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 9: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 0: Degree 7

Now, we will count the triangles:

- Triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle <0, 5, 4>
- Triangle <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle <0, 8, 9>
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle <1, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
