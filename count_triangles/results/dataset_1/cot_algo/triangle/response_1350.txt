Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we'll sort the vertices by their degrees:

- Vertex 0 has 2 edges
- Vertex 1 has 3 edges
- Vertex 3 has 3 edges
- Vertex 4 has 3 edges
- Vertex 7 has 1 edge
- Vertex 8 has 3 edges
- Vertex 9 has 3 edges

Relabeling the vertices from least to most connected:

- Vertex 7 (with 1 edge) becomes V0
- Vertex 0 (with 2 edges) becomes V1
- Vertex 1 (with 3 edges) becomes V2
- Vertex 3 (with 3 edges) becomes V3
- Vertex 4 (with 3 edges) becomes V4
- Vertex 8 (with 3 edges) becomes V5
- Vertex 9 (with 3 edges) becomes V6

Looking at the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 1): Shared connections with vertex 3 form a triangle: <0, 1, 3>
- Edge (0, 3): No triangles
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles
- Edge (3, 4): Shared connections with vertex 1 form a triangle: <1, 3, 4>
- Edge (4, 7): No triangles
- Edge (8, 9): No triangles

Now, we count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found:

The total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 3> and <1, 3, 4>.
