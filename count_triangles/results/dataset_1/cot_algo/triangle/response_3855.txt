Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new numbering of the nodes is as follows:
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:
- (0, 1) shares the connection 2 in common, forming the triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- (0, 2) shares the connection 3 in common, forming the triangle <0, 2, 3>.
- (1, 2) shares the connection 3 in common, forming the triangle <1, 2, 3>.
- (3, 4) shares the connection 7 in common, forming the triangle <3, 4, 7>.
- (6, 8) shares the connection 2 in common, forming the triangle <6, 8, 2>.
- (6, 8) shares the connection 3 in common, forming the triangle <6, 8, 3>.
- (6, 8) shares the connection 9 in common, forming the triangle <6, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 3>, <3, 4, 7>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 8, 3>, and <6, 8, 9>.
