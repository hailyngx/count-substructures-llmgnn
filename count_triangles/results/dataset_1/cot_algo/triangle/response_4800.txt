Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 8: 0 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

After relabeling the nodes:
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 8: 0 connections
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

Now, we will check for triangles with the edges where the node with lower label has fewer connections:

Triangle 1: <1, 2, 5>
Triangle 2: <1, 2, 9>
Triangle 3: <2, 5, 9>
Triangle 4: <2, 5, 6>
Triangle 5: <2, 6, 9>
Triangle 6: <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
