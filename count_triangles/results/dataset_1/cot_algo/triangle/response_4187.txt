Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new label for each vertex would be:
Vertices: 4, 3, 6, 6, 5, 3, 5, 4, 3, 3

Checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 5, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
