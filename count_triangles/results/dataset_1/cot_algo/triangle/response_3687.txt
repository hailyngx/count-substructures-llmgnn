Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 1: 7 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Examining each edge, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 2> through edge (0, 1)
- Triangle <0, 1, 3> through edge (0, 3)
- Triangle <1, 5, 8> through edge (1, 8)
- Triangle <1, 6, 9> through edge (1, 6)
- Triangle <2, 1, 5> through edge (2, 5)
- Triangle <3, 4, 5> through edge (3, 4)
- Triangle <5, 8, 9> through edge (5, 8)
- Triangle <5, 8, 9> through edge (8, 9)
- Triangle <5, 7, 9> through edge (7, 9)

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
