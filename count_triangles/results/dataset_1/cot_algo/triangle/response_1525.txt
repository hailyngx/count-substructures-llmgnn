Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 0 has 2 connections
- Node 4 has 2 connections
- Node 9 has 2 connections
- Node 1 has 3 connections
- Node 8 has 3 connections
- Node 3 has 4 connections
- Node 7 has 4 connections
- Node 5 has 6 connections
- Node 2 has 5 connections
- Node 6 has 5 connections

Now, we will go through the edges and check for triangles:

- Edge (0, 3): Forms triangle with node 5. Triangle <0, 3, 5>.
- Edge (0, 6): No triangle.
- Edge (1, 5): No triangle.
- Edge (1, 6): No triangle.
- Edge (1, 8): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle <1, 8, 2>.
- Edge (2, 5): Forms triangle with nodes 9 and 7. Triangles <2, 5, 9> and <2, 5, 7>.
- Edge (2, 6): Forms triangle with node 4. Triangle <2, 6, 4>.
- Edge (2, 8): Forms triangle with node 1. Triangle <2, 8, 1>.
- Edge (3, 0): No triangle.
- Edge (3, 5): Forms triangle with node 7. Triangle <3, 5, 7>.
- Edge (3, 7): Forms triangle with node 5. Triangle <3, 7, 5>.
- Edge (4, 5): Forms triangle with node 6. Triangle <4, 5, 6>.
- Edge (4, 6): No triangle.
- Edge (4, 7): Forms triangle with node 5. Triangle <4, 7, 5>.
- Edge (5, 1): No triangle.
- Edge (5, 2): Forms triangle with nodes 7 and 9. Triangles <5, 2, 7> and <5, 2, 9>.
- Edge (5, 3): Forms triangle with node 7. Triangle <5, 3, 7>.
- Edge (5, 4): Forms triangle with node 6. Triangle <5, 4, 6>.
- Edge (5, 7): Forms triangle with nodes 9 and 1. Triangles <5, 7, 9> and <5, 7, 1>.
- Edge (5, 9): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle <5, 9, 2>.
- Edge (6, 0): No triangle.
- Edge (6, 1): No triangle.
- Edge (6, 2): Forms triangle with node 8. Triangle <6, 2, 8>.
- Edge (6, 4): No triangle.
- Edge (6, 8): Forms triangle with node 1. Triangle <6, 8, 1>.
- Edge (7, 3): No triangle.
- Edge (7, 4): No triangle.
- Edge (7, 5): Forms triangle with node 1. Triangle <7, 5, 1>.
- Edge (7, 8): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle <7, 8, 2>.
- Edge (7, 9): Forms triangle with node 5. Triangle <7, 9, 5>.
- Edge (8, 1): No triangle.
- Edge (8, 2): Forms triangle with node 5. Triangle <8, 2, 5>.
- Edge (8, 6): Forms triangle with node 7. Triangle <8, 6, 7>.
- Edge (8, 7): Forms triangle with node 5. Triangle <8, 7, 5>.
- Edge (9, 5): Forms triangle with node 1. Triangle <9, 5, 1>.
- Edge (9, 7): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle <9, 7, 2>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [19] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <1, 8, 2>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 8, 1>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 7, 5>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 2, 9>, <5, 3, 7>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 1>, <5, 9, 2>, <6, 2, 8>, <6, 8, 1>, <7, 5, 1>, <7, 8, 2>, <7, 9, 5>.
