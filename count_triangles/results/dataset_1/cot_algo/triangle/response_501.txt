Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections), we get the following list:  
Vertices: 2, 0, 9, 5, 8, 9, 2, 7, 8, 7 

Starting with the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
(0, 1) -> Forms a triangle with node 4: <0, 1, 4>
(1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with node 5: <1, 4, 5>
(1, 6) -> No triangles formed
(3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 4: <3, 5, 4>
(3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 1: <3, 6, 1>
(3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with node 6: <3, 7, 6>
(4, 1) -> Triangle already counted
(4, 5) -> Triangle already counted
(4, 8) -> No triangles formed
(5, 3) -> Triangle already counted
(5, 4) -> Triangle already counted
(6, 1) -> Triangle already counted
(6, 3) -> Triangle already counted
(6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with node 3: <6, 7, 3>
(6, 8) -> No triangles formed
(7, 3) -> Triangle already counted
(7, 6) -> Triangle already counted
(7, 9) -> No triangles formed
(8, 4) -> No triangles formed
(8, 6) -> No triangles formed
(9, 7) -> No triangles formed

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 6, 1>, <3, 7, 6>
