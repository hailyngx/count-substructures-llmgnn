Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. 
The vertices sorted by the number of connections are: 
Node 9 (Degree 2) 
Node 6 (Degree 2) 
Node 0 (Degree 2) 
Node 1 (Degree 3) 
Node 2 (Degree 3) 
Node 7 (Degree 3) 
Node 3 (Degree 4) 
Node 8 (Degree 4) 
Node 5 (Degree 7) 
Node 4 (Degree 8)

Based on the connections and the ordering, the triangles found in this graph are:
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 4>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 3>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 0>
<4, 7, 1>
<4, 8, 3>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 1>
<5, 7, 4>
<5, 7, 0>
<5, 8, 3>
<5, 8, 4>
<5, 2, 8>
<6, 9, 4>
<7, 0, 8>
<7, 1, 5>
<8, 0, 2>
<8, 0, 3>
<8, 2, 5>
<8, 3, 4>
<9, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [25].
