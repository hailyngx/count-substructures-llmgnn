Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree in ascending order, we get the following order: 

Node 5 has 0 connection(s).
Node 0 has 1 connection(s).
Node 5 has 1 connection(s).
Node 0 has 2 connection(s).
Node 4 has 2 connection(s).
Node 6 has 2 connection(s).
Node 9 has 2 connection(s).
Node 1 has 3 connection(s).
Node 7 has 3 connection(s).
Node 3 has 4 connection(s).

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Check edge (0, 3):
   Node 0 (degree 1) < Node 3 (degree 4)
   Shared connections between 0 and 3: None

2. Check edge (1, 4):
   Node 1 (degree 3) < Node 4 (degree 2)
   Shared connections between 1 and 4: None

3. Check edge (1, 7):
   Node 1 (degree 3) < Node 7 (degree 3)
   Shared connections between 1 and 7: None

4. Check edge (1, 9):
   Node 1 (degree 3) < Node 9 (degree 2)
   Shared connections between 1 and 9: None

5. Check edge (2, 6):
   Node 2 (degree 2) < Node 6 (degree 2)
   Shared connections between 2 and 6: None

6. Check edge (2, 8):
   Node 2 (degree 2) < Node 8 (degree 3)
   Shared connections between 2 and 8: None

7. Check edge (3, 7):
   Node 3 (degree 4) < Node 7 (degree 3)
   Shared connections between 3 and 7: None

8. Check edge (3, 8):
   Node 3 (degree 4) < Node 8 (degree 3)
   Shared connections between 3 and 8: None

9. Check edge (4, 6):
   Node 4 (degree 2) < Node 6 (degree 2)
   Shared connections between 4 and 6: None
