Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Node 0 has 2 connections
Node 7 has 2 connections
Node 5 has 2 connections
Node 9 has 1 connection
Node 8 has 2 connections
Node 6 has 3 connections
Node 1 has 4 connections
Node 2 has 2 connections
Node 4 has 5 connections
Node 3 has 6 connections

Now, starting from the edge with the lowest labeled vertex, we can count the triangles by identifying shared connections:

- Triangle <0, 1, 3>
- Triangle <1, 3, 4>
- Triangle <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
