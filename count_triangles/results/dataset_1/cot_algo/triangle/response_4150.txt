Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order:
   Vertices: 1, 3, 9, 5, 6, 8, 2, 4, 7, 0

2. Relabel the vertices based on their order:
   New labels: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

3. Count the number of triangles by checking shared connections:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 4, 7>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 4, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 6, 8>
   
   Total number of triangles: [4]
