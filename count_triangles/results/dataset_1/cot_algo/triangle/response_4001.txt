Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeled vertices: 
Vertex 5 (degree 2)
Vertex 8 (degree 2)
Vertex 3 (degree 3)
Vertex 9 (degree 3)
Vertex 4 (degree 4)
Vertex 7 (degree 4)
Vertex 2 (degree 5)
Vertex 1 (degree 6)
Vertex 6 (degree 6)
Vertex 0 (degree 8)

Now, let's count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
[5]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
The unique triangle found is <5, 0, 6>.
