Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
- Vertex 4: 0 connections
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 0: 5 connections
- Vertex 2: 5 connections
- Vertex 9: 5 connections

Now, we will traverse the edges in the graph while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Counting the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 6 form triangle <0, 2, 6>.
2. Edge (0, 6): No triangles added.
3. Edge (0, 9): Shared connections with 2 form triangle <0, 2, 9>.
4. Edge (1, 2): No triangles added.
5. Edge (1, 5): No triangles added.
6. Edge (2, 5): No triangles added.
7. Edge (2, 6): Shared connections with 0 form triangle <0, 2, 6>.
8. Edge (2, 9): Shared connections with 0 form triangle <0, 2, 9>.
9. Edge (3, 6): No triangles added.
10. Edge (3, 7): No triangles added.
11. Edge (3, 8): No triangles added.
12. Edge (5, 7): Shared connections with 9 form triangle <5, 7, 9>.

Finally, the total number of triangles found in the graph is [3].
