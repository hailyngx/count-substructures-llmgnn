Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connected, the new vertex order is: 7, 6, 1, 3, 5, 2, 8, 9, 0, 4.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine each edge based on the new vertex numbering.
Checking each edge with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections, we can find the triangles formed by shared connections.

Count of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
