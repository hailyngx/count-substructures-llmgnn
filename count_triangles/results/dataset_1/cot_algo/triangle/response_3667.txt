Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the given graph.
  
  First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
  Vertex 7 and 9 have 1 connection.
  Vertex 4 and 7 have 1 connection.
  Vertex 2 and 4 have 2 connections.
  Vertex 0, 6, and 9 have 2 connections.
  Vertex 3 has 3 connections.
  Vertex 1 and 7 have 4 connections.
  Vertex 5 and 8 have 4 connections.

  Now, we'll relabel the vertices according to their number of connections:
  Vertex 7 (degree 1) -> Vertex 0
  Vertex 9 (degree 1) -> Vertex 1
  Vertex 4 (degree 1) -> Vertex 2
  Vertex 2 (degree 2) -> Vertex 3
  Vertex 0 (degree 2) -> Vertex 4
  Vertex 6 (degree 2) -> Vertex 5
  Vertex 3 (degree 2) -> Vertex 6
  Vertex 1 (degree 3) -> Vertex 7
  Vertex 7 (degree 4) -> Vertex 8
  Vertex 5 (degree 4) -> Vertex 9
  Vertex 8 (degree 4) -> Vertex 10

  Next, we'll look at each edge and count the triangles:
  For edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 and Vertex 1 share connections with Vertex 8, so there is one triangle <0, 1, 8>.
  For edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 and Vertex 8 share connections with Vertex 1, so there is one triangle <0, 8, 1>.
  For edge (1, 0): No new triangles.
  For edge (1, 5): No new triangles.
  For edge (1, 8): No new triangles.
  For edge (2, 3): No new triangles.
  For edge (2, 6): No new triangles.
  For edge (3, 2): No new triangles.
  For edge (3, 6): No new triangles.
  For edge (4, 5): No new triangles.
  For edge (5, 1): No new triangles.
  For edge (5, 4): No new triangles.
  For edge (5, 8): No new triangles.
  For edge (6, 2): No new triangles.
  For edge (6, 3): No new triangles.
  For edge (7, 9): No new triangles.
  For edge (8, 0): No new triangles.
  For edge (8, 1): No new triangles.
  For edge (8, 5): No new triangles.
  For edge (9, 7): No new triangles.

  Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
