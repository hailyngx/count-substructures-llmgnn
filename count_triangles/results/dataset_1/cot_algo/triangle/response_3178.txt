Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by connections:
Node 2: 0 connections
Node 4: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Triangles found:
<0, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
