Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order: 3, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1, 5, 4, 9, 2

Let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Start with node 3 (degree 2): No triangles can be formed with this node.
2. Move to node 6 (degree 2): No triangles can be formed with this node.
3. Move to node 7 (degree 2): No triangles can be formed with this node.
4. Move to node 8 (degree 2): No triangles can be formed with this node.
5. Move to node 0 (degree 2): No triangles can be formed with this node.
6. Move to node 1 (degree 2): No triangles can be formed with this node.
7. Move to node 5 (degree 3): No triangles can be formed with this node.
8. Move to node 4 (degree 4): Possible triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 9>.
9. Move to node 9 (degree 4): Additional triangles: <4, 9, 2>, <4, 9, 5>, <9, 2, 5>.

Finally, counting the total number of triangles and listing the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 9, 2>, <4, 9, 5>, <9, 2, 5>
