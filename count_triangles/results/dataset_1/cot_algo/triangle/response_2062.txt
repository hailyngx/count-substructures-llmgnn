Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 1: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 6

Next, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 1 (Degree 2) -> Node 1
Node 7 (Degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 8 (Degree 2) -> Node 3
Node 2 (Degree 3) -> Node 4
Node 4 (Degree 3) -> Node 5
Node 6 (Degree 3) -> Node 6
Node 5 (Degree 4) -> Node 7
Node 9 (Degree 5) -> Node 8
Node 3 (Degree 6) -> Node 9

Now, we analyze each edge to count the triangles:

1. Edge (1, 3):
   Both nodes 1 and 3 have degree 2, hence proceed.
   Shared connections: None

2. Edge (1, 6):
   Vertex 1 has degree 2, and vertex 6 has degree 3.
   Shared connections: None

3. Edge (2, 3):
   Vertex 2 has degree 3, and vertex 3 has degree 6.
   Shared connections: None

4. Edge (2, 4):
   Both nodes 2 and 4 have degree 3, hence proceed.
   Shared connections: Node 3

5. Edge (2, 9):
   Vertex 2 has degree 3, and vertex 9 has degree 5.
   Shared connections: Node 3

6. Edge (3, 1):
   This edge has already been analyzed.

7. Edge (3, 2):
   This edge has already been analyzed.

8. Edge (3, 4):
   This edge has already been analyzed.

9. Edge (3, 5):
   Vertex 3 has degree 6, and vertex 5 has degree 4.
   Shared connections: None

10. Edge (3, 6):
   Vertex 3 has degree 6, and vertex 6 has degree 3.
   Shared connections: None

11. Edge (3, 9):
    Vertex 3 has degree 6, and vertex 9 has degree 5.
    Shared connections: Nodes 2, 5

12. Edge (4, 2):
    This edge has already been analyzed.

13. Edge (4, 3):
    This edge has already been analyzed.

14. Edge (5, 3):
    This edge has already been analyzed.

15. Edge (5, 7):
    Vertex 5 has degree 4, and vertex 7 has degree 2.
    Shared connections: None

16. Edge (5, 8):
    Vertex 5 has degree 4, and vertex 8 has degree 2.
    Shared connections: None

17. Edge (5, 9):
    Vertex 5 has degree 4, and vertex 9 has degree 5.
    Shared connections: Node 3

18. Edge (6, 1):
    This edge has already been analyzed.

19. Edge (6, 3):
    This edge has already been analyzed.

20. Edge (6, 8):
    Vertex 6 has degree 3, and vertex 8 has degree 2.
    Shared connections: None

21. Edge (7, 5):
    This edge has already been analyzed.

22. Edge (7, 9):
    Vertex 7 has degree 2, and vertex 9 has degree 5.
    Shared connections: Node 5

23. Edge (8, 5):
    This edge has already been analyzed.

24. Edge (8, 6):
    This edge has already been analyzed.

25. Edge (9, 2):
    This edge has already been analyzed.

26. Edge (9, 3):
    This edge has already been analyzed.

27. Edge (9, 5):
    This edge has already been analyzed.

28. Edge (9, 7):
    This edge has already been analyzed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are: 
<2, 5, 9> 
<3, 5, 9> 
<5, 7, 9>
