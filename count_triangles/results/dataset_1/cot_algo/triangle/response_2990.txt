Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will calculate the degree of each node: 

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections

Arranging nodes in ascending order of their degrees:

Node 0, 3, 4: 2 connections
Node 5, 7, 8, 9: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections

Now, checking the edges while ensuring to proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Calculating the number of triangles:
Triangles: 1, 2, 6
Triangles: 1, 2, 7
Triangles: 1, 6, 7
Triangles: 2, 6, 7
Triangles: 6, 7, 9

Total triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>
