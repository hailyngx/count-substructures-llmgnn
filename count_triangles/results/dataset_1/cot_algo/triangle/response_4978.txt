Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labels are as follows:
- Vertex 4 has 0 connections.
- Vertex 7 has 0 connections.
- Vertex 0 has 5 connections.
- Vertex 2 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 6 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 1 has 3 connections.
- Vertex 3 has 3 connections.
- Vertex 5 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 8 has 3 connections.
- Vertex 9 has 4 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find that the following triangles exist:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
