Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections (degree):
node 6 (degree 1) - lowest degree
node 7 (degree 2)
node 1 (degree 2)
node 4 (degree 3)
node 9 (degree 3)
node 5 (degree 5)
node 2 (degree 5)
node 0 (degree 6)
node 3 (degree 6) - highest degree
node 8 (degree 7)
