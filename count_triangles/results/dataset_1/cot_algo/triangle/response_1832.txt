Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 

Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can analyze the edges:

1. Edge (0, 3):
   Both vertex 0 and vertex 3 have 3 connections, but vertex 3 has a lower label.
   Checking for shared connections of vertices 0 and 3, we find a triangle with vertex 4.
   
2. Edge (0, 4):
   Both vertex 0 and vertex 4 have 2 connections, but vertex 4 has a lower label.
   Checking for shared connections of vertices 0 and 4, we find a triangle with vertex 7.

3. Edge (0, 6):
   Vertex 0 has 3 connections, and vertex 6 has 4 connections. Thus, we proceed.
   Checking for shared connections of vertices 0 and 6, we find two triangles: <0, 3, 6> and <0, 4, 6>.

4. Edge (1, 6):
   Both vertex 1 and vertex 6 have 4 connections, but vertex 1 has a lower label.
   Checking for shared connections of vertices 1 and 6, we find a triangle with vertex 9.

5. Edge (1, 9):
   Both vertex 1 and vertex 9 have 3 connections, but vertex 9 has a lower label.
   Checking for shared connections of vertices 1 and 9, we find no new triangles.

6. Edge (2, 5):
   Both vertex 2 and vertex 5 have 1 connection, but vertex 5 has a lower label.
   Checking for shared connections of vertices 2 and 5, we find no triangle.

7. Edge (2, 8):
   Vertex 2 has 2 connections while vertex 8 has 1 connection. Thus, we proceed.
   Checking for shared connections of vertices 2 and 8, we find no triangle.

8. Edge (3, 7):
   Vertex 3 has 2 connections while vertex 7 has 2 connections. Thus, we proceed.
   Checking for shared connections of vertices 3 and 7, we find no triangle.

9. Edge (4, 7):
   Both vertex 4 and vertex 7 have 2 connections, but vertex 7 has a lower label.
   Checking for shared connections of vertices 4 and 7, we find no new triangles.

10. Edge (6, 1):
   Vertex 6 has 4 connections while vertex 1 has 2 connections. Thus, we proceed.
   Checking for shared connections of vertices 6 and 1, we find no triangle.

11. Edge (6, 9):
   Vertex 6 has 4 connections and vertex 9 has 3 connections. Thus, we proceed.
   Checking for shared connections of vertices 6 and 9, we find no new triangles.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
