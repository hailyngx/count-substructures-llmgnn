Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0 has 6 connections
- Vertex 1 has 2 connections
- Vertex 2 has 4 connections
- Vertex 3 has 3 connections
- Vertex 4 has 4 connections
- Vertex 5 has 5 connections
- Vertex 6 has 3 connections
- Vertex 7 has 6 connections
- Vertex 8 has 4 connections
- Vertex 9 has 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

We proceed with the edges in the following order:
(1, 0) - No triangles
(3, 7) - No triangles
(3, 8) - No triangles
(3, 9) - No triangles
(2, 4) - Triangle <2, 4, 7>
(2, 5) - Triangle <2, 5, 0>
(2, 7) - Triangle <2, 7, 4>
(2, 8) - No triangles
(4, 0) - Triangle <4, 0, 5>
(4, 2) - Triangle <4, 2, 7>
(4, 7) - Triangle <4, 7, 0>
(5, 0) - Triangle <5, 0, 4>
(5, 1) - No triangles
(5, 2) - Triangle <5, 2, 7>
(5, 6) - No triangles
(5, 7) - Triangle <5, 7, 0>
(6, 0) - No triangles
(6, 5) - No triangles
(6, 9) - No triangles
(0, 1) - No triangles
(0, 4) - Triangle <0, 4, 7>
(0, 5) - Triangle <0, 5, 4>
(0, 6) - No triangles
(0, 7) - Triangle <0, 7, 4>
(0, 8) - No triangles
(7, 2) - Triangle <7, 2, 4>
(7, 3) - No triangles
(7, 4) - Triangle <7, 4, 0>
(7, 5) - Triangle <7, 5, 0>
(7, 9) - No triangles
(8, 0) - No triangles
(8, 2) - No triangles
(8, 3) - No triangles
(8, 9) - No triangles
(9, 3) - No triangles
(9, 6) - No triangles
(9, 7) - No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 7, 4>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 0>, <4, 0, 5>, <4, 2, 7>, and <5, 7, 0>.
