Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 3 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 5
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 6
Node 0 has degree 7

Proceeding with the Degree-Based Ordering method:

For the edge (0, 1): Both 0 and 1 have lower degree than 5. They share 3 common neighbors (2, 4, 8), forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
For the edge (0, 2): Node 0 has a higher degree than 4. No triangle is formed.
For the edge (0, 4): Node 0 has a higher degree than 6. No triangle is formed.
For the edge (0, 7): Node 0 has a higher degree than 2. No triangle is formed.
For the edge (0, 8): Node 0 has a higher degree than 5. No triangle is formed.
For the edge (1, 2): Both 1 and 2 have lower degree than 4. They share 3 common neighbors (0, 4, 8), forming a triangle <1, 2, 0>.
For the edge (1, 4): Both 1 and 4 have lower degree than 6. They share 3 common neighbors (0, 2, 8), forming a triangle <1, 4, 0>.
For the edge (1, 6): Node 1 has a higher degree than 3. No triangle is formed.
For the edge (1, 8): Both 1 and 8 have lower degree than 5. They share 3 common neighbors (0, 4, 9), forming a triangle <1, 8, 0>.
For the edge (2, 4): Both 2 and 4 have lower degree than 6. They share 3 common neighbors (0, 1, 8), forming a triangle <2, 4, 0>.
For the edge (3, 5): Both 3 and 5 have lower degree than 4. They share 1 common neighbor (4), forming a triangle <3, 5, 4>.
For the edge (3, 9): Both 3 and 9 have lower degree than 3. They share 0 common neighbor. No triangle is formed.
For the edge (4, 5): Both 4 and 5 have lower degree than 6. They share 3 common neighbors (0, 1, 8), forming a triangle <4, 5, 0>.
For the edge (4, 8): Both 4 and 8 have lower degree than 6. They share 3 common neighbors (0, 1, 2), forming a triangle <4, 8, 0>.
For the edge (5, 6): Node 5 has a higher degree than 3. No triangle is formed.
For the edge (5, 7): Node 5 has a higher degree than 2. No triangle is formed.
For the edge (6, 9): Both 6 and 9 have lower degree than 3. They share 0 common neighbor. No triangle is formed.
For the edge (7, 8): Node 7 has a higher degree than 2. No triangle is formed.
For the edge (8, 9): Both 8 and 9 have lower degree than 3. They share 1 common neighbor (0), forming a triangle <8, 9, 0>.
