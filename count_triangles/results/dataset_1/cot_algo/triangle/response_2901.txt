Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the vertices based on their connections:

- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Next, we will relabel the nodes based on their number of connections:

- Node 4: 0 connections
- Node 6: 0 connections
- Node 8: 0 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

- (0, 1): No triangle
- (0, 3): No triangle
- (0, 7): No triangle
- (0, 8): No triangle
- (0, 9): <0, 2, 9>
- (1, 0): No triangle
- (1, 2): No triangle
- (1, 8): No triangle
- (2, 1): No triangle
- (2, 3): No triangle
- (2, 4): No triangle
- (2, 5): No triangle
- (2, 9): No triangle
- (3, 0): No triangle
- (3, 2): No triangle
- (3, 4): No triangle
- (3, 5): No triangle
- (4, 2): No triangle
- (4, 3): No triangle
- (5, 2): No triangle
- (5, 3): No triangle
- (5, 7): No triangle
- (6, 7): No triangle
- (6, 9): No triangle
- (7, 0): No triangle
- (7, 5): No triangle
- (7, 6): No triangle
- (8, 0): No triangle
- (8, 1): No triangle
- (9, 0): No triangle
- (9, 2): No triangle
- (9, 6): No triangle

After reviewing all edges, we found that there is only one triangle <0, 2, 9> in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1].
