Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their respective degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0(4) < 1(4) < 8(4) < 3(3) < 7(4) < 2(4) < 5(3) < 6(4) < 9(2)

Next, we will count the triangles by examining each edge:

- Edge (0, 1): Vertices 0 and 1 share 0 common neighbors.
- Edge (0, 3): Vertices 0 and 3 share 1 common neighbor, vertex 5. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <0, 3, 5>.
- Edge (0, 4): Vertices 0 and 4 share 0 common neighbors.
- Edge (0, 5): Vertices 0 and 5 share 1 common neighbor, vertex 6. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <0, 5, 6>.
- Edge (1, 2): Vertices 1 and 2 share 1 common neighbor, vertex 8. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <1, 2, 8>.
- Edge (2, 6): Vertices 2 and 6 share 1 common neighbor, vertex 7. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <2, 6, 7>.
- Edge (2, 7): Vertices 2 and 7 share 1 common neighbor, vertex 6. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <2, 7, 6>.
- Edge (2, 8): Vertices 2 and 8 share 1 common neighbor, vertex 1. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <2, 8, 1>.
- Edge (3, 7): Vertices 3 and 7 share 1 common neighbor, vertex 0. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <3, 7, 0>.
- Edge (5, 6): Vertices 5 and 6 share 1 common neighbor, vertex 7. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <5, 6, 7>.
- Edge (6, 7): Vertices 6 and 7 share 2 common neighbors, vertices 2 and 5. Therefore, two triangles are formed: <6, 7, 2> and <6, 7, 5>.
- Edge (6, 9): Vertices 6 and 9 share 1 common neighbor, vertex 8. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <6, 9, 8>.
- Edge (7, 8): Vertices 7 and 8 share 1 common neighbor, vertex 2. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <7, 8, 2>.
- Edge (8, 9): Vertices 8 and 9 share 1 common neighbor, vertex 6. Therefore, a triangle is formed: <8, 9, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
