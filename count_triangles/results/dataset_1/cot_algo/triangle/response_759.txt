Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0 - degree 2
Node 2 - degree 2
Node 7 - degree 2
Node 4 - degree 3
Node 6 - degree 3
Node 3 - degree 4
Node 1 - degree 5
Node 8 - degree 5
Node 9 - degree 5
Node 5 - degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(0, 1) - Node 0 has 2 connections, Node 1 has 5 connections
(0, 8) - Node 0 has 2 connections, Node 8 has 5 connections
(1, 3) - Node 1 has 5 connections, Node 3 has 4 connections
(2, 4) - Node 2 has 2 connections, Node 4 has 3 connections
(5, 7) - Node 5 has 6 connections, Node 7 has 2 connections
(6, 9) - Node 6 has 3 connections, Node 9 has 5 connections
(8, 9) - Node 8 has 5 connections, Node 9 has 5 connections

By finding shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we identify the triangles:

<0, 1, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 3>
<5, 7, 6>
<5, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
