Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree.

Degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 0: 2
- Vertex 1: 1
- Vertex 2: 5
- Vertex 3: 1
- Vertex 4: 3
- Vertex 5: 1
- Vertex 6: 4
- Vertex 7: 1
- Vertex 8: 4
- Vertex 9: 1

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 1 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 2 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 3 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 4 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 5 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 6 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 7 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 8 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 9
- Vertex 9 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 10

Now, we go through the edges and count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 8): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
2. Edge (1, 2): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
3. Edge (2, 1): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
4. Edge (2, 3): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
5. Edge (2, 5): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
6. Edge (2, 7): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
7. Edge (3, 2): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
8. Edge (4, 6): Check for shared connections. Triangle formed with Vertex 6 and 8 <4, 6, 8>.
9. Edge (4, 8): Check for shared connections. Triangle formed with Vertex 4 and 6 <4, 6, 8>.
10. Edge (5, 2): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
11. Edge (6, 4): Check for shared connections. Triangle formed with Vertex 6 and 8 <4, 6, 8>.
12. Edge (6, 8): Check for shared connections. Triangle formed with Vertex 4 and 8 <4, 6, 8>.
13. Edge (6, 9): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
14. Edge (7, 2): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
15. Edge (8, 0): Check for shared connections. No triangles.
16. Edge (8, 4): Check for shared connections. Triangle formed with Vertex 4 and 6 <4, 6, 8>.
17. Edge (8, 6): Check for shared connections. Triangle formed with Vertex 4 and 6 <4, 6, 8>.
18. Edge (9, 6): Check for shared connections. No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is 4, and the unique triangles found are <4, 6, 8>. 

Thus, the output is [4].
