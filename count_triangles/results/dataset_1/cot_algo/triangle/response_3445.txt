Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list each node along with its connections:

- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 7

Now, we will sort the nodes based on the number of their connections:

Nodes by degree:
1. Node 3: 1 connection
2. Node 4: 1 connection
3. Node 8: 2 connections
4. Node 0: 2 connections
5. Node 5: 2 connections
6. Node 6: 3 connections
7. Node 1: 3 connections
8. Node 9: 4 connections
9. Node 2: 5 connections
10. Node 7: 7 connections

Now, we will go through the edges in the order specified and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 7): Node 0 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
2. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
3. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
4. Edge (1, 7): Node 1 is lower degree, common neighbor 0, Triangle <0, 1, 7>.
5. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
6. Edge (2, 1): Node 1 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
7. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 is lower degree, common neighbor 7, Triangle <2, 6, 7>.
8. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 is lower degree, common neighbor 6, Triangle <2, 6, 7>.
9. Edge (2, 8): Node 2 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
10. Edge (2, 9): Node 2 is lower degree, common neighbor 1, Triangle <1, 2, 9>.
11. Edge (3, 7): Node 3 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
12. Edge (4, 5): Node 4 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
13. Edge (5, 4): Node 4 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
14. Edge (5, 7): Node 5 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
15. Edge (6, 2): Node 2 is lower degree, common neighbor 7, Triangle <2, 6, 7>.
16. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 is lower degree, common neighbor 2, Triangle <2, 6, 7>.
17. Edge (6, 8): Node 8 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
18. Edge (7, 0): Node 0 is lower degree, common neighbor 1, Triangle <0, 1, 7>.
19. Edge (7, 1): Node 1 is lower degree, common neighbor 0, Triangle <0, 1, 7>.
20. Edge (7, 2): Node 2 is lower degree, common neighbor 6, Triangle <2, 6, 7>.
21. Edge (7, 3): Node 3 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
22. Edge (7, 5): Node 5 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
23. Edge (7, 6): Node 6 is lower degree, common neighbor 2, Triangle <2, 6, 7>.
24. Edge (7, 9): Node 7 is lower degree, common neighbors 0, 1, 2, Triangle <0, 1, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 9>.
25. Edge (8, 2): Node 2 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
26. Edge (8, 6): Node 6 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
27. Edge (9, 0): Node 0 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
28. Edge (9, 1): Node 1 is lower degree, no common neighbors.
29. Edge (9, 2): Node 2 is lower degree, common neighbor 1, Triangle <1, 2, 9>.
30. Edge (9, 7): Node 7 is lower degree, common neighbors 0, 1, 2, Triangle <0, 1, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 9>.
