Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections. Then we will relabel the vertices accordingly.

Number of connections for each vertex:
0: 2
1: 2
2: 3
3: 2
4: 4
5: 5
6: 3
7: 1
8: 3
9: 4

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
7 < 0 < 1 < 3 < 6 < 8 < 2 < 9 < 4 < 5

Now, we will list the triangles found by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found:
<1, 2, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
