Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new ordering is: 2, 6, 0, 4, 8, 9, 5, 1, 7, 3.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:
- Starting with edge (2, 8): both 2 and 8 have 1 connection and no shared connections, so no triangle.
- Moving on to edge (6, 9): both 6 and 9 have 2 connections and shared connection with node 5, forming a triangle <5, 6, 9>.
- Edge (0, 3): node 3 has 3 connections and node 0 has 4 connections. No triangle here.
- Edge (4, 1): node 1 has 4 connections and node 4 has 3 connections. No triangle.
- Edge (8, 3): node 3 has 3 connections and node 8 has 3 connections. No triangle.
- Edge (9, 5): node 5 has 4 connections and node 9 has 4 connections. No triangle.
- Edge (1, 7): node 7 has 5 connections and node 1 has 4 connections. Triangle <1, 7, 9> formed.
- Edge (7, 4): node 4 has 3 connections and node 7 has 5 connections. No triangle.
- Edge (7, 8): node 8 has 3 connections and node 7 has 5 connections. No triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <5, 6, 9> and <1, 7, 9>.
