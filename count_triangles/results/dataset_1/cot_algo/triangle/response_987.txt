Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 7: Degree 0
Node 1: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 2: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 1) - Proceed (Node 0 has fewer connections)
(0, 3) - Proceed (Node 0 has fewer connections)
(0, 4) - Proceed (Node 0 has fewer connections)
(1, 0) - Proceed (Node 1 has fewer connections)
(2, 9) - Proceed (Node 2 has fewer connections)
(3, 0) - Proceed (Node 3 has fewer connections)
(3, 4) - Proceed (Node 3 has fewer connections)
(3, 5) - Proceed (Node 3 has fewer connections)
(4, 0) - Proceed (Node 4 has fewer connections)
(4, 3) - Proceed (Node 4 has fewer connections)
(4, 8) - Proceed (Node 4 has fewer connections)
(4, 9) - Proceed  (Node 4 has fewer connections)
(5, 3) - Proceed  (Node 5 has fewer connections)
(6, 9) - Proceed  (Node 6 has fewer connections)
(8, 4) - Proceed  (Node 8 has fewer connections)
(8, 9) - Proceed  (Node 8 has fewer connections)
(9, 2) - Proceed  (Node 9 has fewer connections)
(9, 4) - Proceed  (Node 9 has fewer connections)
(9, 6) - Proceed  (Node 6 has fewer connections)
(9, 8) - Proceed  (Node 8 has fewer connections)

Now, we will determine the triangles formed by the shared connections:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 0>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
