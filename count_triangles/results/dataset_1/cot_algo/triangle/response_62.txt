Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method provides the following relabeling of vertices based on the number of their connections: 
Vertices: 3-2, 6-4, 2-4, 9-4, 1-6, 8-6, 3-7, 4-7, 6-7, 2-8, 0-9, 1-9, 5-9, 7-9, 8-9

After relabeling the vertices, we analyze the edges only when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

The triangles found in this graph are: 
<0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <6, 4, 9>, <8, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in total, which can be shown as [5].
