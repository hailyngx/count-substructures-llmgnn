Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:

Vertex 1: degree 1
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 5

Now, we will examine each edge based on the vertices' labels and degrees to count the number of triangles.

Calculating the number of triangles:

Vertex 1 (degree 1) - Edge (1, 8) with Vertex 8 (degree 5):
No triangles.

Vertex 5 (degree 2) - Edge (2, 5) with Vertex 2 (degree 3):
No triangles.

Vertex 5 (degree 2) - Edge (5, 6) with Vertex 6 (degree 3):
No triangles.

Vertex 7 (degree 2) - Edge (4, 7) with Vertex 4 (degree 5):
No triangles.

Vertex 7 (degree 2) - Edge (7, 8) with Vertex 8 (degree 5):
No triangles.

Vertex 2 (degree 3) - Edge (2, 8) with Vertex 8 (degree 5):
Possible triangle: <2, 5, 8>.

Vertex 2 (degree 3) - Edge (8, 1) with Vertex 8 (degree 5):
No triangles.

Vertex 6 (degree 3) - Edge (6, 9) with Vertex 9 (degree 4):
Possible triangle: <6, 8, 9>.

Vertex 3 (degree 4) - Edge (3, 6) with Vertex 6 (degree 3):
Possible triangle: <3, 4, 6>.
Possible triangle: <3, 6, 9>.

Vertex 9 (degree 4) - Edge (9, 8) with Vertex 8 (degree 5):
Possible triangle: <9, 4, 8>.
Possible triangle: <9, 6, 8>.

Calculating the total number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found: <2, 5, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <9, 4, 8>, <9, 6, 8>.
