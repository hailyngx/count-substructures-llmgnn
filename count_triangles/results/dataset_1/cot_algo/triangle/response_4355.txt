Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of connections each node has:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we'll relabel the nodes based on their number of connections:
- Node 0 (2 connections) becomes Node 0
- Node 1 (2 connections) becomes Node 1
- Node 4 (3 connections) becomes Node 2
- Node 8 (3 connections) becomes Node 3
- Node 6 (1 connection) becomes Node 4
- Node 7 (1 connection) becomes Node 5
- Node 2 (4 connections) becomes Node 6
- Node 3 (4 connections) becomes Node 7
- Node 5 (4 connections) becomes Node 8
- Node 9 (4 connections) becomes Node 9

Now we'll list the edges following the degree-based ordering:
(0, 2) (1, 3) (4, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (0, 2) (1, 3) (4, 9) (6, 9) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 8) (2, 5) (2, 5) (0, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle 2: <5, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles is [2].
