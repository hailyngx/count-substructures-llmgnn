Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
0-3 connections: 2, 4, 9
1-4 connections: 5, 8
2-4 connections: 3, 7
3-5 connections: 0
4-5 connections: 1
5-5 connections: 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle <6, 8, 1>
- Triangle <6, 0, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
