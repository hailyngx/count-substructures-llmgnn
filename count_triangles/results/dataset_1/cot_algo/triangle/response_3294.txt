Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Let's label the vertices accordingly:

Node 7 has 0 connections.
Node 8 has 1 connection: (8, 0).
Node 9 has 1 connection: (9, 0).
Node 4 has 2 connections: (4, 1), (4, 2).
Node 5 has 2 connections: (5, 1), (5, 4).
Node 7 has 2 connections: (7, 1), (7, 3).
Node 2 has 3 connections: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4).
Node 6 has 3 connections: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4).
Node 3 has 4 connections: (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8).
Node 1 has 6 connections: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7).

Now, we will find the triangles in the graph based on the shared connections:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 6>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
