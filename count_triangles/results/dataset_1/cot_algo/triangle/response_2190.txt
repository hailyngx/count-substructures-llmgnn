Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By arranging the vertices based on their degree:

Node 2 has connections: 2 (Degree: 1)
Node 4 has connections: 4 (Degree: 1)
Node 5 has connections: 5 (Degree: 1)
Node 1 has connections: 1, 8 (Degree: 2)
Node 3 has connections: 3 (Degree: 2)
Node 7 has connections: 7, 9 (Degree: 2)
Node 0 has connections: 0, 6 (Degree: 3)
Node 6 has connections: 6, 1, 4 (Degree: 3)
Node 8 has connections: 8, 3, 4, 7 (Degree: 4)
Node 9 has connections: 9, 0, 7 (Degree: 3)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order: 

1. (2, 3) - No triangle
2. (2, 5) - No triangle
3. (4, 6) - No triangle
4. (6, 0) - Triangle <0, 6, 9>
5. (6, 1) - No triangle
6. (6, 4) - Triangle <4, 6, 8>
7. (6, 8) - Triangle <6, 8, 4>
8. (6, 9) - No triangle
9. (7, 0) - Triangle <0, 7, 9>
10. (7, 8) - Triangle <7, 8, 4>
11. (7, 9) - No triangle

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 4>, <0, 7, 9>
