Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 3

Based on the relabeling, we analyze the edges using the rule that the vertex with the lower label must have fewer connections.

Checking the edges:
(2, 4): Forms a triangle with 2 shared connection(s) <2, 1, 4>
(2, 8): No triangle formed
(4, 2): No triangle formed
(5, 1): No triangle formed
(6, 7): No triangle formed
(7, 1): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection <7, 1, 9>
(7, 6): No triangle formed
(8, 2): No triangle formed
(8, 9): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection <8, 1, 9>
(9, 1): No triangle formed
(9, 8): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection <9, 1, 8>
(1, 5): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection <1, 5, 7>
(1, 7): No triangle formed
(1, 9): No triangle formed

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <2, 1, 4>, <7, 1, 9>, <8, 1, 9>, <1, 5, 7>
