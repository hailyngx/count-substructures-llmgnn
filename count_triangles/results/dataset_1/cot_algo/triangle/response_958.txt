Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 3: degree 1
Nodes 1, 4, 7: degree 2
Nodes 5, 6, 8: degree 3
Nodes 0, 9: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 3 -> A
Nodes 1, 4, 7 -> B, C, D
Nodes 5, 6, 8 -> E, F, G
Nodes 0, 9 -> H, I
Node 2 -> J

Let's start counting the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 8, 3>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 3>
<5, 8, 4>
<5, 8, 6>
<6, 9, 0>
<6, 9, 2>
<7, 9, 0>
<7, 9, 2>
<9, 0, 5>
<9, 0, 6>
<9, 0, 2>
<9, 1, 2>
<9, 1, 7>
<9, 1, 4>

Total number of triangles: [24]
