Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their number of connections:  

Vertex 1: 1 connection  
Vertex 0: 4 connections  
Vertex 6: 2 connections  
Vertex 7: 3 connections  
Vertex 9: 3 connections  
Vertex 2: 3 connections  
Vertex 5: 4 connections  
Vertex 8: 3 connections  
Vertex 3: 4 connections  
Vertex 4: 4 connections  

Since we have 10 nodes, we will relabel them accordingly:  
Vertex 0 -> 1  
Vertex 1 -> 2  
Vertex 6 -> 3  
Vertex 7 -> 4  
Vertex 9 -> 5  
Vertex 2 -> 6  
Vertex 5 -> 7  
Vertex 8 -> 8  
Vertex 3 -> 9  
Vertex 4 -> 10  

Now, we will examine each edge based on the degree-based ordering method:  

1. (1, 2) - Vertex 1 has 1 connection, proceed. No shared connections with Vertex 2.  
2. (1, 5) - Vertex 1 has 1 connection, proceed. No shared connections with Vertex 5.  
3. (1, 4) - Vertex 1 has 1 connection, proceed. No shared connections with Vertex 4.  
4. (1, 7) - Vertex 1 has 1 connection, proceed. Shared connection with Vertex 4 and Vertex 7, form a triangle <1, 4, 7>.  
5. (2, 9) - Vertex 2 has 3 connections, proceed. No shared connections with Vertex 9.  
6. (3, 9) - Vertex 3 has 4 connections, proceed. No shared connections with Vertex 9.  
7. (3, 4) - Vertex 3 has 4 connections, proceed. Shared connection with Vertex 4 and Vertex 5, form a triangle <3, 4, 5>.  
8. (4, 5) - Vertex 4 has 4 connections, proceed. Shared connection with Vertex 3 and Vertex 5, form a triangle <3, 4, 5>.  
9. (5, 7) - Vertex 5 has 4 connections, proceed. No shared connections with Vertex 7.  
10. (5, 9) - Vertex 5 has 4 connections, proceed. No shared connections with Vertex 9.  

Count of triangles: [2]  
Unique triangles: <1, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 5>
