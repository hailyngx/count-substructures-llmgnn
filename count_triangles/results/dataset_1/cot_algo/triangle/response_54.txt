Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 
Vertices: 0 (degree 3), 1 (degree 3), 6 (degree 2), 7 (degree 1), 9 (degree 1), 2 (degree 2), 4 (degree 4), 5 (degree 5), 8 (degree 5), 3 (degree 4).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
Starting from the vertices with the lowest degrees and moving to the highest degrees, we get the following unique triangles:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
