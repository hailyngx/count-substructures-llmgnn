Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Then we will label the vertices accordingly.

Here is the list of vertices and their connections:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 6 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 5 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 1 connection
- Vertex 7: 5 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections

Relabeling based on the number of connections:
- Vertex 6 (1 connection) -> A
- Vertex 0, 2, 9 (2 connections) -> B, C, D
- Vertex 5, 8 (3 connections) -> E, F
- Vertex 4 (4 connections) -> G
- Vertex 3, 7 (5 connections) -> H, I
- Vertex 1 (6 connections) -> J

Now, let's check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- B-C (0-2): None
- B-D (0-9): None
- B-E (0-5): None
- C-D (2-9): None
- C-E (2-5): None
- D-E (9-5): None
- E-F (5-8): None
- H-I (3-7): None
- E-G (5-4): None
- F-G (8-4): <4, 5, 8>
- H-H (3-3): None
- I-G (7-4): None
- E-H (5-3): None
- E-I (5-7): None
- F-H (8-3): None
- F-I (8-7): None
- G-I (4-7): None
- B-J (0-1): None
- E-J (5-1): None
- F-J (8-1): None
- G-J (4-1): <1, 4, 5>
- H-J (3-1): None
- I-J (7-1): None

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <4, 5, 8> and <1, 4, 5>.
