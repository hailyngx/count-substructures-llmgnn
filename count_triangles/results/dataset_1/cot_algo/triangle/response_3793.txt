Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on the number of connections are: 
Vertex 0: 2 connections 
Vertex 2: 2 connections 
Vertex 8: 1 connection 
Vertex 3: 2 connections 
Vertex 5: 4 connections 
Vertex 9: 4 connections 
Vertex 4: 4 connections 
Vertex 6: 4 connections 
Vertex 1: 5 connections 
Vertex 7: 4 connections 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles in the graph:
