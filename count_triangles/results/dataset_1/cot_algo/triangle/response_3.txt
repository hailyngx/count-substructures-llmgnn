Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their degree. The vertices are relabeled as follows:  

Vertex 3: 0 edges  
Vertex 0: 4 edges  
Vertex 1: 2 edges  
Vertex 5: 3 edges  
Vertex 6: 3 edges  
Vertex 9: 2 edges  
Vertex 2: 3 edges  
Vertex 7: 5 edges  
Vertex 4: 6 edges  

Using this new labeling, we can identify the triangles formed in the graph:  
1. <0, 2, 4> triangle  
2. <0, 5, 7> triangle  
3. <0, 7, 5> triangle  
4. <1, 4, 7> triangle  
5. <2, 0, 4> triangle  
6. <2, 4, 7> triangle  
7. <4, 1, 7> triangle  
8. <4, 2, 0> triangle  
9. <4, 2, 7> triangle  
10. <4, 6, 7> triangle  
11. <4, 9, 3> triangle  
12. <5, 0, 7> triangle  
13. <5, 6, 7> triangle  
14. <6, 4, 7> triangle  
15. <7, 5, 0> triangle  
16. <7, 5, 6> triangle  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
