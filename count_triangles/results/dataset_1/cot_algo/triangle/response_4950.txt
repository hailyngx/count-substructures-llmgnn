Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Now, we relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 1: 0
Node 0: 1
Node 8: 2
Node 5: 3
Node 3: 4
Node 9: 5
Node 6: 6
Node 4: 7
Node 7: 8
Node 2: 9

Next, we look at each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 2): Check shared connections between nodes 0 and 2 (There is a shared connection with node 7, forming a triangle <0, 2, 7>)
- Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 7): Check shared connections between nodes 2 and 7 (There is a shared connection with nodes 0 and 4, forming two triangles <0, 2, 7> and <2, 4, 7>)
- Edge (2, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 9): Check shared connections between nodes 4 and 9 (There is a shared connection with node 6, forming a triangle <4, 6, 9>)
- Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 4, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 9>. 

So, the final output is: [4]
