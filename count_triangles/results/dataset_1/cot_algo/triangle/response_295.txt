Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on the number of connections (degree):

Vertex 3 (Degree 1)
Vertex 6 (Degree 1)
Vertex 7 (Degree 1)
Vertex 8 (Degree 1)
Vertex 0 (Degree 4)
Vertex 1 (Degree 3)
Vertex 9 (Degree 3)
Vertex 5 (Degree 3)
Vertex 2 (Degree 3)
Vertex 4 (Degree 5)

Using the lower labeled vertices to form edges, we analyze each edge for shared connections to find triangles. 

Calculating the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4> (shared connection: 0)
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 5> (shared connection: 4)
- Triangle 3: <0, 4, 9> (shared connection: 4)
- Triangle 4: <1, 5, 9> (shared connection: 5)

Final Output: [4]
