Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees, then relabeling them accordingly. Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their degrees:

Nodes' degrees:
0: 2
1: 2
4: 2
8: 2
5: 3
7: 3
9: 3
6: 4
3: 5
2: 5

Reordered vertices:
0, 1, 4, 8, 5, 7, 9, 6, 3, 2

Now, let's count the number of triangles formed in this graph using the method described:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
