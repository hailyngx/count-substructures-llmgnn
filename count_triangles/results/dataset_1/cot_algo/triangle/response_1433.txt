Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following labels:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 8: 0 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections

Now, we will count the triangles by considering the edges in the graph:
1. For the edge (0, 1), we can form triangles with shared connections 2 and 8. Thus, <0, 1, 2> and <0, 1, 8>.
2. For the edge (0, 2), we can form a triangle with shared connection 3. Thus, <0, 2, 3>.
3. For the edge (0, 4), there are no triangles.
4. For the edge (0, 8), there are no triangles.
5. For the edge (0, 9), there are no triangles.
6. For the edge (1, 3), we can form a triangle with shared connection 6. Thus, <1, 3, 6>.
7. For the edge (1, 6), we can form a triangle with shared connection 7. Thus, <1, 6, 7>.
8. For the edge (1, 7), there are no triangles.
9. For the edge (1, 8), there are no triangles.
10. For the edge (2, 3), there are no triangles.
11. For the edge (2, 5), there are no triangles.
12. For the edge (2, 7), there are no triangles.
13. For the edge (3, 4), there are no triangles.
14. For the edge (3, 6), we can form a triangle with shared connection 9. <3, 6, 9>.
15. For the edge (4, 6), there are no triangles.
16. For the edge (6, 7), there are no triangles.
17. For the edge (6, 9), there are no triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
