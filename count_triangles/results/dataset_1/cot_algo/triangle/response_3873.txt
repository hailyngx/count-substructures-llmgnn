Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes by their number of connections:

Nodes sorted by their connections:
3 (2 connections)
7 (2 connections)
4 (3 connections)
6 (3 connections)
5 (4 connections)
9 (4 connections)
1 (5 connections)
2 (5 connections)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Check the edge (1, 2): Both nodes have 5 connections, so proceed to the next edge.
2. Check the edge (1, 4): Node 4 has 3 connections which is less than node 1's connections, so check for shared connections. Nodes 3 and 6 are connected to both nodes 1 and 4, forming a triangle <1, 4, 3>.
3. Check the edge (1, 6): Both nodes have the same number of connections, so proceed to the next edge.
4. Check the edge (1, 9): Node 9 has 4 connections which is less than node 1's connections, and node 5 is connected to both nodes 1 and 9, forming a triangle <1, 9, 5>.
5. Check the edge (2, 1): This edge was already checked with edge 1, so skip.
6. Check the edge (2, 5): Both nodes have 5 connections, so proceed to the next edge.
7. Check the edge (2, 9): Node 9 has 4 connections which is less than node 2's connections, so check for shared connections. Nodes 1 and 5 are connected to both nodes 2 and 9, forming a triangle <2, 9, 1>.
8. Check the edge (3, 4): Node 3 has 2 connections which is less than node 4's connections, so check for shared connections. Nodes 1 and 6 are connected to both nodes 3 and 4, forming a triangle <3, 4, 1>.
9. Check the edge (3, 7): Both nodes have 2 connections, so proceed to the next edge.
10. Check the edge (4, 1): This edge was already checked with edge 2, so skip.
11. Check the edge (4, 3): This edge was already checked with edge 8, so skip.
12. Check the edge (5, 2): This edge was already checked with edge 6, so skip.
13. Check the edge (5, 6): Both nodes have different connection numbers, so proceed to the next edge.
14. Check the edge (5, 7): Node 7 has 2 connections which is less than node 5's connections, so check for shared connections. Nodes 3 and 5 are connected to both nodes 7 and 5, forming a triangle <5, 7, 3>.
15. Check the edge (5, 9): This edge was already checked with edge 7, so skip.
16. Check the edge (6, 1): This edge was already checked with edge 3, so skip.
17. Check the edge (6, 5): This edge was already checked with edge 13, so skip.
18. Check the edge (7, 3): This edge was already checked with edge 9, so skip.
19. Check the edge (7, 5): This edge was already checked with edge 14, so skip.
20. Check the edge (9, 1): This edge was already checked with edge 4, so skip.
21. Check the edge (9, 2): This edge was already checked with edge 7, so skip.
22. Check the edge (9, 5): This edge was already checked with edge 15, so skip.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles found: <1, 4, 3>, <1, 9, 5>, <2, 9, 1>, <5, 7, 3>
