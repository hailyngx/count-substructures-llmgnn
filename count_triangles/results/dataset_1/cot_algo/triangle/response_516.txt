Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:

0 -> 4 connections
1 -> 0 connections
2 -> 1 connection
3 -> 3 connections
4 -> 3 connections
5 -> 3 connections
6 -> 3 connections
7 -> 5 connections
8 -> 2 connections
9 -> 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges with vertices in increasing order:

Edge (2, 8): Both vertices have fewer connections, so we proceed.
Edge (3, 5): Proceed since 3 < 5.
Edge (3, 7): Proceed since 3 < 5.
Edge (3, 9): Proceed since 3 < 5.
Edge (4, 6): Proceed since 4 < 6.
Edge (4, 7): Proceed since 4 < 6.
Edge (5, 3): We skip this as 3 is not less than 5.
Edge (5, 6): Proceed since 5 < 6.
Edge (6, 4): We skip this as 4 is not less than 6.
Edge (6, 5): We skip this as 5 is not less than 6.
Edge (7, 0): Proceed since 0 < 5.
Edge (7, 3): Proceed since 3 < 5.
Edge (7, 4): Proceed since 4 < 5.
Edge (7, 8): Proceed since 7 < 8.
Edge (7, 9): Proceed since 7 < 8.
Edge (8, 2): Proceed since 2 < 5.
Edge (8, 7): Proceed since 7 < 8.
Edge (9, 3): Proceed since 3 < 5.
Edge (9, 7): Proceed since 7 < 8.
