Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: (1, 3, 5, 6, 9), (10), (7), (0, 1, 3, 4), (2, 8).

Therefore, the new labels will be as follows:
(1) - 0 connections (2) - 1 connection (5) - 1 connection (6) - 1 connection (9) - 1 connection (10) - 1 connection (7) - 2 connections (0) - 4 connections (4) - 4 connections (3) - 5 connections (8) - 5 connections (2) - 6 connections

Next, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
(0, 1) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(0, 2) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(0, 4) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(1, 0) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(2, 0) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(2, 8) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(4, 0) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(4, 7) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(4, 8) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(5, 8) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(7, 4) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(7, 8) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(8, 2) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(8, 4) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(8, 5) - No triangles as both nodes have different degrees.
(8, 7) - <0, 4, 8> is a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 8>.
