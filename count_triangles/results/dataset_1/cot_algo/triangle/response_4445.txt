Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices from least to most connections:

Nodes in order of degree: 4, 8, 9, 5, 1, 3, 7, 6, 2, 0

After relabeling, the edges will be: (4, 8) (4, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (1, 7) (3, 7) (7, 6) (6, 2) (2, 0) (0, 6) (5, 8) (2, 1) (8, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (0, 8) (9, 0) (9, 6) (6, 0)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the total number of triangles to be [12].

The unique triangles found are: 
<2, 6, 7>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<3, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 3>
