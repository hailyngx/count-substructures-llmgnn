Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have the following relabeled vertices:  
Vertices:  3  6  8  0  1  7  5  9  2  4  

Now, we can count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.  

Triangles:  
[<1, 7, 9> <4, 6, 9>]  

Total number of triangles: [2]
