Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph with vertices sorted by their degree in ascending order is: 
Nodes: 7, 5, 6, 9, 3, 1, 4, 2, 0

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Checking edge (0, 7): Both nodes have degree 2 but are not connected to any common node.
- Checking edge (0, 9): Node 9 has degree 3 and is connected to nodes 3 and 0. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9. Thus, a triangle is formed: <0, 7, 9>.
- Checking edge (1, 2): Node 2 has degree 3 and is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 6. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 4. There are no common neighbors, so no triangle is formed.
- Checking edge (1, 4): Node 1 has degree 4 and is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 5. The common neighbor is node 5, forming a triangle: <1, 4, 5>.
- Checking edge (1, 5): Node 5 has degree 4 and is connected to nodes 4, 2, 1, and 6. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 2. The common neighbor is node 4, forming a triangle: <1, 5, 4>.
- Checking edge (2, 1): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (2, 5): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (2, 6): Node 2 has degree 3 and is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 2. The common neighbor is node 4, forming a triangle: <2, 6, 4>.
- Checking edge (3, 4): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (3, 9): Node 3 has degree 2 and is connected to nodes 4 and 9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 3. The common neighbor is node 0, forming a triangle: <3, 9, 0>.
- Checking edge (4, 1): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (4, 3): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (4, 5): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (4, 6): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (5, 1): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (5, 2): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (5, 4): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (6, 2): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (6, 4): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (7, 0): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (9, 0): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.
- Checking edge (9, 3): This edge has already been checked in a previous step.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] with unique triangles being <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, and <2, 6, 4>.
