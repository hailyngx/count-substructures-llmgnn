Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method in this case results in the following vertex order from least to most connections: 0, 7, 8, 4, 5, 6, 1, 9, 3, 2.

Now, as per the method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 2) is valid as 0 (degree 3) is less than 2 (degree 4). Triangle: <0, 2, 1>.
2. Edge (0, 3) is valid as 0 (degree 3) is less than 3 (degree 6). Triangle: <0, 3, 1>.
3. Edge (1, 2) is not valid as both have the same degree.
4. Edge (1, 3) is valid as 1 (degree 3) is less than 3 (degree 6). Triangle: <1, 3, 9>.
5. Edge (1, 9) is valid as 1 (degree 3) is less than 9 (degree 6). Triangle: <1, 9, 4>.
6. Edge (2, 5) is valid as 2 (degree 4) is less than 5 (degree 2). Triangle: <2, 5, 8>.
7. Edge (3, 6) is valid as 3 (degree 6) is less than 6 (degree 3). Triangle: <3, 6, 4>.
8. Edge (3, 7) is valid as 3 (degree 6) is less than 7 (degree 2). Triangle: <3, 7, 9>.
9. Edge (3, 9) is valid as 3 (degree 6) is less than 9 (degree 6). Triangle: <3, 9, 4>.
10. Edge (4, 6) is valid as 4 (degree 2) is less than 6 (degree 3). Triangle: <4, 6, 9>.
11. Edge (7, 9) is valid as 7 (degree 2) is less than 9 (degree 6). Triangle: <7, 9, 8>.
12. Edge (8, 9) is valid as 8 (degree 2) is less than 9 (degree 6). Triangle: <8, 9, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9] and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 1>, <0, 3, 1>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 9, 4>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 9, 4>, <4, 6, 9>, <7, 9, 8>, and <8, 9, 5>.
