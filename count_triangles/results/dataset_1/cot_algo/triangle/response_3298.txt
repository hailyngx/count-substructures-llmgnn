Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first sort the vertices based on their degree.

Sorted list of vertices based on degree:
Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 3 connections (Highest)
Vertex 4: 3 connections (Highest)

Given the edges and sorted vertices, let's count the triangles:
- (0, 4): No triangle
- (1, 8): No triangle
- (2, 7): No triangle
- (3, 6): No triangle
- (4, 0): No triangle
- (4, 7): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>
- (6, 3): No triangle
- (7, 2): No triangle
- (7, 4): Additional triangle formed: <2, 4, 7>
- (8, 1): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 7>
