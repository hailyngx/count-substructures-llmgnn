Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
Nodes with 0 connections: 3, 5
Nodes with 1 connection: 7
Nodes with 2 connections: 2
Nodes with 3 connections: 9
Nodes with 4 connections: 0, 1
Nodes with 5 connections: 4
Nodes with 6 connections: 8
Nodes with 7 connections: 6

Next, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 8> (Shared connection: 1)
2. <0, 8, 9> (Shared connection: 0)
3. <1, 6, 8> (Shared connection: 1, 8)
4. <2, 6, 7> (Shared connection: 6)
5. <2, 6, 9> (Shared connection: 6)
6. <3, 4, 8> (Shared connection: 3)
7. <4, 6, 7> (Shared connection: 4, 6)
8. <4, 6, 8> (Shared connection: 4, 6)
9. <6, 7, 9> (Shared connection: 6)

Total number of triangles: [9]
