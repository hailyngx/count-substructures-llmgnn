Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
The given graph with vertices sorted based on their degree is as follows:
Vertices: 6, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3

Edges: (6, 2), (4, 8), (5, 3), (6, 2), (3, 0), (2, 1), (3, 7), (4, 8), (3, 5), (3, 7)

Now, counting the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 3>
- Triangle <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle <0, 3, 7> 

[Total number of triangles: [3]]
