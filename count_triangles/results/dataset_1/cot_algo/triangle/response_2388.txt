Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Starting with the degree-based ordering method:

Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 3 has 1 connection.
Node 8 has 0 connections.
Nodes 0, 2, and 8 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 1 and 4 have 4 connections each.
Node 9 has 6 connections.
Node 7 has 5 connections.

Relabeling the nodes accordingly:
Node 5 → 0
Node 6 → 1
Node 3 → 2
Node 8 → 3
Node 0 → 4
Node 2 → 5
Node 8 → 6
Node 1 → 7
Node 4 → 8
Node 9 → 9
Node 7 → 10

Using the degree-based ordering method, we consider the edges to count the number of triangles:
1. Edge (0, 1): Nodes 0 and 1 share node 7, forming a triangle <0, 1, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 3): No triangle is formed.
3. Edge (0, 9): Nodes 0 and 9 share node 4, forming a triangle <0, 9, 4>.
4. Edge (1, 0): This is the reverse of edge 1, so it doesn't create a new triangle.
5. Edge (1, 2): Nodes 1 and 2 don't share any common neighbors, so no triangle is formed.
6. Edge (1, 4): Nodes 1 and 4 share node 8, forming a triangle <1, 4, 8>.
7. Edge (1, 7): Nodes 1 and 7 share nodes 0 and 2, forming two triangles <1, 7, 0> and <1, 7, 2>.
8. Edge (2, 1): This is the reverse of edge 5, so it doesn't create a new triangle.
9. Edge (2, 7): Nodes 2 and 7 share node 1, forming a triangle <2, 7, 1>.
10. Edge (3, 0): This is the reverse of edge 2, so it doesn't create a new triangle.
11. Edge (4, 1): This is the reverse of edge 6, so it doesn't create a new triangle.
12. Edge (4, 6): Nodes 4 and 6 don't share any common neighbors, so no triangle is formed.
13. Edge (4, 9): Nodes 4 and 9 share node 8, forming a triangle <4, 9, 8>.
14. Edge (5, 9): No triangle is formed.
15. Edge (6, 4): This is the reverse of edge 12, so it doesn't create a new triangle.
16. Edge (7, 1): This is the reverse of edge 7, so it doesn't create a new triangle.
17. Edge (7, 2): This is the reverse of edge 9, so it doesn't create a new triangle.
18. Edge (7, 9): Nodes 7 and 9 share nodes 0 and 2, forming two triangles <7, 9, 0> and <7, 9, 2>.
19. Edge (9, 0): This is the reverse of edge 3, so it doesn't create a new triangle.
20. Edge (9, 4): This is the reverse of edge 13, so it doesn't create a new triangle.
21. Edge (9, 5): No triangle is formed.
22. Edge (9, 7): This is the reverse of edge 18, so it doesn't create a new triangle.
