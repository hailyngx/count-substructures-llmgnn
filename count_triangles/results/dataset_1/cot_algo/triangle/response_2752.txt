Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Degree-Based Ordering
The degrees of each node are as follows:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection

Sorting the nodes by degree in ascending order, we get:
Nodes 5, 8, 9, 2, 4, 6, 3, 0, 7, 1

Step 2: Analyzing edges
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

The triangles identified are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>

Step 3: Counting the total number of triangles
The total number of triangles is [2].
