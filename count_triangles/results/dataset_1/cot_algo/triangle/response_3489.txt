Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections (degrees).

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 2 (degree 1)
- Vertex 3 (degree 1)
- Vertex 8 (degree 1)
- Vertex 7 (degree 3)
- Vertex 9 (degree 6)
- Vertex 5 (degree 6)
- Vertex 1 (degree 7)
- Vertex 6 (degree 7)
- Vertex 0 (degree 8)
- Vertex 4 (degree 8)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will now count the number of triangles:
1. For edges (2, 9) and (5, 9): No triangle formed.
2. For edges (3, 4) and (3, 6): No triangle formed.
3. For edges (4, 6) and (6, 7): Triangle <4, 6, 7> formed.
4. For edges (5, 0) and (5, 1): Triangle <0, 1, 5> formed.
5. For edges (7, 5) and (7, 6): Triangle <5, 6, 7> formed.
6. For edges (9, 5) and (9, 7): Triangle <5, 7, 9> formed.
7. For edges (9, 8) and (8, 9): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles:
- <4, 6, 7>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 7, 9>
