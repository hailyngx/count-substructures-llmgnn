Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method as described and count the triangles accordingly.

First, we need to calculate the degrees of each vertex:
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 9: 2 connections

Reordering the vertices based on degree:
Nodes with the lowest degrees:
- Node 4, Node 8
Nodes with the next lowest degree:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9

Now we will count the triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. Edge: (2, 4) - Proceed
   - Shared connections: None

2. Edge: (6, 8) - Proceed
   - Shared connections: None

3. Edge: (1, 6) - Proceed
   - Shared connections: 1
     Triangle formed: <1, 6, 9>

4. Edge: (7, 9) - Proceed
   - Shared connections: 1
     Triangle formed: <7, 9, 1>

5. Edge: (2, 7) - Proceed
   - Shared connections: 2
     Triangle formed: <2, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <1, 6, 9>, <7, 9, 1>, <2, 7, 9>
