Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree. 

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 2

Now, we will relabel the nodes according to their degrees from least to most:
Node 1: 1
Node 3: 2
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 4
Node 0: 5
Node 4: 6
Node 5: 7
Node 6: 8
Node 2: 9
Node 7: 10

Next, we will go through each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We will count the triangles formed by shared connections:

<1, 7, 10>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 7, 10>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
