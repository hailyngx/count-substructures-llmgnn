Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 2 (connected to 2 other nodes), Node 5 (1), Node 8 (2), Node 7 (2), Node 9 (3), Node 3 (4), Node 1 (5), Node 6 (5), Node 0 (6), Node 4 (6).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles formed by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge starting from the edges involving nodes with lower labels that have fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is [4].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 9>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, and <1, 4, 8>.
