Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 7 connections

Next, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 4 (1 connection) -> Node 0
Node 5 (1 connection) -> Node 1
Node 7 (1 connection) -> Node 2
Node 0 (2 connections) -> Node 3
Node 3 (2 connections) -> Node 4
Node 6 (3 connections) -> Node 5
Node 1 (4 connections) -> Node 6
Node 8 (7 connections) -> Node 7

Now, we will examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

<0, 5> and <5, 0> share a connection with Node 6, forming a triangle.
<3, 6> and <6, 3> share a connection with Node 1, forming a triangle.
<6, 5> and <5, 6> share a connection with Node 8, forming a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 6> and <1, 3, 6>.
