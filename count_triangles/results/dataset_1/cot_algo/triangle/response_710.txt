Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
0 -> 5 connections
9 -> 2 connections
3 -> 2 connections
6 -> 1 connection
1 -> 4 connections
7 -> 4 connections
4 -> 5 connections
2 -> 4 connections
8 -> 5 connections
5 -> 7 connections

Based on the sorted vertices, we will go through each edge and count the triangles.

Triangles:
