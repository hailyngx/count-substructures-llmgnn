Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labeling is as follows: 

Node 0 - 1 connection
Node 1 - 1 connection
Node 3 - 1 connection
Node 7 - 1 connection
Node 4 - 2 connections
Node 9 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 3 connections
Node 6 - 4 connections
Node 8 - 6 connections
Node 2 - 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 5): No triangle formed.
2. Edge (1, 4): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (2, 6): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (2, 7): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (2, 8): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (2, 9): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (4, 1): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (5, 0): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (5, 6): Triangle <0, 5, 6> found.
11. Edge (5, 8): Triangle <5, 6, 8> found.
12. Edge (6, 2): Triangle <2, 6, 8> found.
13. Edge (6, 5): Triangle <5, 6, 8> found.
14. Edge (6, 8): Triangles <2, 6, 8> and <5, 6, 8> found.
15. Edge (7, 2): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (8, 2): Triangles <2, 6, 8> and <5, 6, 8> found.
17. Edge (8, 3): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (8, 5): Triangle <5, 6, 8> found.
19. Edge (8, 6): Triangle <2, 6, 8> found.
20. Edge (9, 2): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>
