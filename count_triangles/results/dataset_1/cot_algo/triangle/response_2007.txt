Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new ordering is as follows: 

0 (Degree: 2)
1 (Degree: 2)
3 (Degree: 2)
5 (Degree: 3)
7 (Degree: 3)
8 (Degree: 2)
4 (Degree: 4)
6 (Degree: 6)
2 (Degree: 6)
9 (Degree: 8)

Using this ordering and counting triangles based on the given edges, we find that there are a total of 30 triangles.

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 7>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 9, 6>
<5, 4, 6>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 3, 9>
<6, 2, 7>
<9, 7, 6>
<9, 3, 2>
<9, 2, 7> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [30].
