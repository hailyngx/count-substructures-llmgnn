Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 3 has degree 1
Node 7 has degree 1
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 6 has degree 6
Node 0 has degree 7

Relabeling the vertices:
Nodes 3 and 7 have been relabeled to 0, Node 9 has been relabeled to 1, Node 2 has been relabeled to 2, Node 5 has been relabeled to 3, Node 8 has been relabeled to 4, Node 1 has been relabeled to 5, Node 4 has been relabeled to 6, Node 6 has been relabeled to 7, Node 0 has been relabeled to 8.

Now, we will check for triangles based on the degree-based ordering:

Triangles: 
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [16]
