Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 5 (degree 2)
- Node 4 (degree 2)
- Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 2 (degree 3)
- Node 6 (degree 3)
- Node 9 (degree 4)
- Node 7 (degree 4)
- Node 1 (degree 5)
- Node 8 (degree 5)
- Node 3 (degree 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the graph, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
