Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by the number of connections. The vertices are ordered as follows:  

0 (degree 3)  
1 (degree 2)  
8 (degree 2)  
9 (degree 5)  
2 (degree 3)  
3 (degree 2)  
4 (degree 2)  
5 (degree 2)  
6 (degree 1)  
7 (degree 1)  

Next, we will proceed to count the triangles:

We start with edges (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 8) because 0 has the lowest degree:
- (0, 1) shares vertex 1 with edge (1, 9) forming triangle <0, 1, 9>.
- (0, 2) shares vertex 2 with edge (2, 9) forming triangle <0, 2, 9>.

Next, we consider edges starting from vertex 1 as it has the next lowest degree:
- (1, 0) does not contribute to any triangles.

Next, we consider vertex 8:
- (8, 0) shares vertex 0 with edge (0, 2) forming triangle <0, 2, 8>.
- (8, 9) shares vertex 9 with edge (9, 2) forming triangle <8, 9, 2>.

Next, we consider vertex 9:
- (9, 1) does not contribute to any triangles.

Next, we consider vertex 2:
- (2, 3) shares vertex 3 with edge (3, 4) forming triangle <2, 3, 4>.
- (2, 9) shares vertex 9 with edge (9, 8) forming triangle <2, 9, 8>.

Next, we consider vertices 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 which do not contribute to any triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 2, 8>, <2, 3, 4>.
