Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connected:

Nodes: 3, 4, 7, 8, 2, 9, 0, 7, 1, 6 

Next, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

3 -> 0
4 -> 1
7 -> 2
8 -> 3
2 -> 4
9 -> 5
0 -> 6
7 -> 7
1 -> 8
6 -> 9

Next, we will list the edges that satisfy the condition of the lower labeled node having fewer connections:

(3, 4) (8, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 5) (7, 1)

Now, we will count the number of triangles formed by these edges:

Number of triangles = 0

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
