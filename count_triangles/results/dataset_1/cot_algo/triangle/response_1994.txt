Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied as follows:

1. Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Vertex 2: 0 connections
Vertex 3: 0 connections
Vertices 0, 1, 5: 4 connections
Vertices 3, 6, 8: 5 connections
Vertices 7, 9: 6 connections
Vertex 4: 7 connections

2. Edges to be considered based on the method:
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 6), (3, 4), (3, 7), (5, 7), (6, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)

3. Counting the triangles formed:
- Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
