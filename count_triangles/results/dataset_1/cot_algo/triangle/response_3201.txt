Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following new labeling:
Node 5 -> Degree 0
Node 8 -> Degree 1
Node 4 -> Degree 2
Node 6 -> Degree 2
Node 1 -> Degree 2
Node 3 -> Degree 2
Node 0 -> Degree 3
Node 9 -> Degree 3
Node 7 -> Degree 6
Node 2 -> Degree 6

Given this labeling, we will now count the triangles forming from the edges as described in the Degree-Based Ordering method.

The total number of triangles is: [7]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 9, 0>
