Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 2 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 2: 2 edges
Node 3: 2 edges
Node 4: 2 edges
Node 5: 2 edges
Node 6: 2 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 9: 2 edges

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 2 (degree 2) -> A
Node 3 (degree 2) -> B
Node 4 (degree 2) -> C
Node 5 (degree 2) -> D
Node 6 (degree 2) -> E
Node 0 (degree 2) -> F
Node 7 (degree 3) -> G
Node 9 (degree 2) -> H
Node 1 (degree 4) -> I
Node 8 (degree 4) -> J

Checking the edges starting with the lowest labeled node:

(F, J)
(I, B)
(I, G)
(I, J)
(A, H)
(B, I)
(C, D)
(C, E)
(D, C)
(E, C)
(G, I)
(G, J)
(J, F)
(J, I)
(J, G)
(H, A)

Now, let's count the triangles:

Total number of triangles: [1]

The unique triangles are:
<F, J, I>
