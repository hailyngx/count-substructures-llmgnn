Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections), with the vertex with the lowest degree receiving the label 0, the next lowest degree receiving the label 1, and so on.

After sorting the vertices, the new labels are as follows:
0 - 4 connections (vertices 4)
1 - 2 connections (vertices 2, 5)
2 - 4 connections (vertices 0, 3, 8)
3 - 5 connections (vertices 1, 6, 9)
4 - 1 connection (vertex 7)

Now, we can proceed with counting the triangles by considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The triangles found are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
