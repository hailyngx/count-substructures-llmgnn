Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees, we have the following relabeling: 
Nodes: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0
Degrees: 0-1-1-1-3-1-4-2-8-4

Examining the edges based on the vertices with lower labels and fewer connections:
- Edge (2, 7): Forms triangle with node 9. <2, 7, 9>
- Edge (2, 9): Forms triangle with nodes 4 and 5. <2, 9, 4> and <2, 9, 5>
- Edge (4, 7): Forms triangle with nodes 9 and 5. <4, 7, 9> and <4, 7, 5>
- Edge (4, 8): No new triangles.
- Edge (4, 9): No new triangles.
- Edge (5, 7): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 9. <5, 7, 0> and <5, 7, 9>
- Edge (6, 9): No new triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7] with unique triangles: <2, 7, 9>, <2, 9, 4>, <2, 9, 5>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 5>, <5, 7, 0>, and <5, 7, 9>.
