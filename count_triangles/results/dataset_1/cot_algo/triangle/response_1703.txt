Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for each vertex are:  
Vertex 0 has degree 2  
Vertex 1 has degree 3  
Vertex 4 has degree 3  
Vertex 6 has degree 3  
Vertex 8 has degree 2  
Vertex 3 has degree 4  
Vertex 5 has degree 4  
Vertex 9 has degree 5  
Vertex 2 has degree 6  
Vertex 7 has degree 6  

Since we will be examining edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will consider the following edges: (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 7), (5, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9).  

By examining shared neighbors for these edges, we find the triangles:  
<0, 3, 5>  
<1, 4, 9>  
<2, 6, 7>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
