Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
3(1), 6(2), 7(3), 5(4), 1(5), 4(6), 8(7), 2(8), 9(9)

Analyzing the edges using the degree-based ordering method, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle <1, 2, 9>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle <4, 7, 9>
- Triangle <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
