Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices from least to most connected is as follows:
Vertex 8 (Degree 1)
Vertex 1 (Degree 1)
Vertex 0 (Degree 2)
Vertex 9 (Degree 3)
Vertex 3 (Degree 4)
Vertex 6 (Degree 5)
Vertex 4 (Degree 5)
Vertex 5 (Degree 5)
Vertex 2 (Degree 5)
Vertex 7 (Degree 6)

Using the degree-based ordering method to count triangles:
1. Edge between 8 and 9 is skipped.
2. Edge between 1 and 7 is skipped.
3. Edge between 0 and 7 forms a triangle with shared connection 7.
4. Edge between 2 and 5 forms a triangle with shared connection 5.
5. Edge between 2 and 6 forms a triangle with shared connection 2 and 6.
6. Edge between 2 and 7 forms a triangle with shared connection 2 and 7.
7. Edge between 3 and 4 forms a triangle with shared connection 3 and 4.
8. Edge between 3 and 5 forms a triangle with shared connection 3 and 5.
9. Edge between 3 and 6 forms a triangle with shared connection 3 and 6.
10. Edge between 3 and 9 forms a triangle with shared connection 3 and 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 9>.
