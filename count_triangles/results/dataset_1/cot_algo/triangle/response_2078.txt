Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 0 has 3 connections
- Vertex 7 has 2 connections
- Vertex 5 has 3 connections
- Vertex 9 has 3 connections
- Vertex 4 has 4 connections
- Vertex 6 has 4 connections
- Vertex 3 has 5 connections
- Vertex 1 has 6 connections
- Vertex 8 has 6 connections
- Vertex 2 has 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (0, 2) forms a triangle with 4
- (0, 3) forms a triangle with 1, 2, 5, 6
- (0, 7) does not form a triangle
- (1, 3) forms a triangle with 2, 6
- (1, 5) forms a triangle with 6
- (1, 6) forms a triangle with 2
- (1, 8) forms a triangle with 2
- (1, 9) forms a triangle with 5
- (2, 4) forms a triangle with 8
- (2, 6) forms a triangle with 8
- (3, 5) does not form a triangle
- (4, 7) does not form a triangle
- (4, 8) forms a triangle with 6
- (4, 9) does not form a triangle
- (5, 9) forms a triangle with 6

Counting the total number of triangles, we get: [13]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 8, 2>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 1, 6>
<4, 2, 8>
<5, 1, 6>
