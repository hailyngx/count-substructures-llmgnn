Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 0 has degree 2  
Vertex 1 has degree 1  
Vertex 6 has degree 1  
Vertex 5 has degree 3  
Vertex 9 has degree 3  
Vertex 7 has degree 4  
Vertex 2 has degree 4  
Vertex 3 has degree 6  
Vertex 8 has degree 6  
Vertex 4 has degree 9  
  
By examining each edge and the vertex labels, we find the following triangles formed:  
<3, 4, 8>  
<4, 8, 9>  
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
