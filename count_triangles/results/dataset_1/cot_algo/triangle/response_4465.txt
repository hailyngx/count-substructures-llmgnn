Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 8: 0 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 1: 8 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

We will start by examining the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Examining (0, 1):
- Both nodes have 2 shared connections: Nodes 2 and 6. Triangle: <0, 2, 6>

Examining (0, 2):
- Both nodes have 2 shared connections: Nodes 1 and 6. Triangle: <0, 1, 6>

Examining (1, 3):
- Both nodes have 1 shared connection: Node 4. Triangle: <1, 4, 3>

Examining (1, 4):
- Node 4 has 3 connections with node 9 and 1 connection with node 7. Therefore, no new triangles are formed.

Examining (1, 5):
- Node 5 has no other connections. Therefore, no new triangles are formed.

Examining (1, 6):
- Both nodes have 2 shared connections: Nodes 0 and 2. Triangle: <0, 2, 6>

Examining (1, 7):
- Node 5 has no other connections. Therefore, no new triangles are formed.

Examining (3, 4):
- Both nodes have 1 shared connection: Node 1. Triangle: <1, 3, 4>

Examining (4, 7):
- Node 7 has 2 shared connections with node 9. Therefore, no new triangles are formed.

Examining (4, 9):
- Node 9 has 2 shared connections: Nodes 6 and 7. Triangle: <6, 7, 9>

The total number of triangles found in the graph is [4].
