Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows the steps below:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections:
   - Node 2 has 1 connection
   - Nodes 1 and 6 have 2 connections each
   - Nodes 5 and 8 have 2 connections each
   - Nodes 4 and 9 have 3 connections each
   - Nodes 3 and 7 have 4 connections each
   - Node 0 has 6 connections

2. Relabel the vertices based on their sorted order:
   - Node 2 (new label: 0)
   - Nodes 1 and 6 (new labels: 1 and 2, respectively)
   - Nodes 5 and 8 (new labels: 3 and 4, respectively)
   - Nodes 4 and 9 (new labels: 5 and 6, respectively)
   - Nodes 3 and 7 (new labels: 7 and 8, respectively)
   - Node 0 (new label: 9)

Now, we will go through the edges, considering only cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- (0, 2): Node 2 has fewer connections, no triangle.
- (0, 3): Node 3 forms a triangle with Node 7 and Node 9 <3, 7, 9>.
- (0, 4): Node 4 forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 9 <4, 5, 9>.
- (0, 5): Node 5 has fewer connections, no triangle.
- (0, 7): Node 7 forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 9 <7, 3, 9>.
- (0, 8): Node 8 has fewer connections, no triangle.
- (1, 3): Node 3 has fewer connections, no triangle.
- (1, 4): Node 4 has fewer connections, no triangle.
- (1, 6): Node 6 forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 3 <6, 1, 3>.
- (4, 6): Node 6 has fewer connections, no triangle.
- (5, 7): Node 7 has fewer connections, no triangle.
- (7, 8): Node 8 has fewer connections, no triangle.

Count of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
- <3, 7, 9>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <6, 1, 3>
