Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. So, here is the list of vertices sorted in ascending order of connections:

Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections

Now, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles formed:

- Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 and Vertex 3 share a connection with Vertex 5, forming a triangle <0, 3, 5>.
- Edge (0, 5): No triangles.
- Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0, 6, and 5 form a triangle <0, 6, 5>.
- Edge (1, 5): No triangles.
- Edge (1, 7): No triangles.
- Edge (2, 6): No triangles.
- Edge (2, 8): No triangles.
- Edge (3, 8): No triangles.
- Edge (4, 6): Vertex 4, 6, and 5 form a triangle <4, 6, 5>.
- Edge (4, 7): No triangles.
- Edge (4, 9): No triangles.
- Edge (5, 6): Vertex 5, 6, and 0 form a triangle <5, 6, 0>. Vertex 5, 6, and 4 form a triangle <5, 6, 4>.
- Edge (5, 7): No triangles.
- Edge (5, 9): No triangles.
- Edge (6, 7): No triangles.
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles.
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles.
- Edge (8, 9): No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 5>
<5, 6, 0>
<5, 6, 4>
