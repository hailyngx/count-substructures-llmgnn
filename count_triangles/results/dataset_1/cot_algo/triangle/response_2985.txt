Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly.

The sorted vertices with their degrees are:
Vertex 5 (Degree 2)
Vertex 6 (Degree 1)
Vertex 8 (Degree 2)
Vertex 9 (Degree 2)
Vertex 3 (Degree 4)
Vertex 1 (Degree 5)
Vertex 2 (Degree 5)
Vertex 0 (Degree 6)
Vertex 7 (Degree 6)
Vertex 4 (Degree 8)

Now, we can count the triangles:

1. For edge (0, 2):
   Both 0 and 2 are connected to 4. Triangle: <0, 2, 4>

2. For edge (0, 3):
   Both 0 and 3 are connected to 1. Triangle: <0, 1, 3>

3. For edge (0, 7):
   Both 0 and 7 are connected to 4 and 1. Triangles: <0, 4, 7> and <0, 1, 7>

4. For edge (0, 9):
   Both 0 and 9 are connected to 4. Triangle: <0, 4, 9>

5. For edge (1, 3):
   Vertex 1 and 3 are connected to 0. Triangle: <0, 1, 3>

6. For edge (1, 4):
   Vertex 1 is connected to 3, and 4 is connected to 0, 2, 6, 7, 9. Triangle: <0, 1, 4>

7. For edge (1, 7):
   Vertex 1 and 7 are connected to 0 and 4. Triangles: <0, 1, 7> and <0, 4, 7>

8. For edge (2, 4):
   Vertex 2 and 4 are connected to 0 and 1. Triangle: <0, 1, 2>

9. For edge (4, 6):
   Vertex 4 is connected to 1 and 0. Triangle: <0, 1, 4>

10. For edge (4, 7):
   Vertex 4 and 7 are connected to 0, 1, 5. Triangles: <0, 1, 4> and <0, 4, 7> and <1, 4, 7>

11. For edge (4, 9):
   Vertex 4 and 9 are both connected to 0. Triangle: <0, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: [11]
