Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:

Node degree:  
Node 0: 3  
Node 1: 5  
Node 2: 2  
Node 3: 3  
Node 4: 3  
Node 5: 5  
Node 6: 3  
Node 7: 3  
Node 8: 3  
Node 9: 2  

Ordering nodes by degree:  
Nodes with degree 2: 2, 9  
Nodes with degree 3: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8  
Nodes with degree 5: 1, 5  

The edges to consider are:  
(2, 1)  
(2, 5)  
(9, 1)  
(9, 5)  
(0, 3)  
(0, 5)  
(0, 6)  
(3, 5)  
(3, 8)  
(4, 6)  
(4, 7)  
(7, 8)  

Counting triangles for the selected edges:  
Triangles:  
<0, 3, 5>  
<1, 2, 5>  
<1, 5, 9>  
<3, 0, 5>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<7, 8, 1>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
