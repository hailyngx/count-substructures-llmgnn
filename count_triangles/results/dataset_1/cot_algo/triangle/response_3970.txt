Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly. 

The sorted vertices are: 
- Node 6 with 0 connections
- Nodes 5 and 8 with 2 connections
- Nodes 0, 6, and 9 with 3 connections
- Nodes 1 and 4 with 4 connections
- Nodes 7 with 5 connections
- Node 2 with 6 connections
- Node 3 with 7 connections

Based on the sorted vertices, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles formed:
1. For edge (0, 3), proceed as 0 < 3: check shared connections (4 and 9) = Triangle <0, 3, 4>
2. For edge (0, 4), proceed as 0 < 4: check shared connection (3) = Triangle <0, 3, 4>
3. For edge (0, 9), proceed as 0 < 9: check shared connections (1, 2, 3) = Triangles <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 9>
4. For edge (1, 2), proceed as 1 < 2: check shared connection (3) = Triangle <1, 2, 3>
5. For edge (1, 3), proceed as 1 < 3: check shared connection (0) = Triangle <0, 1, 3>
6. For edge (1, 4), proceed as 1 < 4: check shared connection (0) = Triangle <0, 1, 4>
7. For edge (1, 6), proceed as 1 < 6: no triangles formed

There are a total of [17] triangles in the graph, which are: 
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 9>
