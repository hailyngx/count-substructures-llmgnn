Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Node 3 has 1 connection.
Node 2 has 1 connection.
Nodes 5 and 8 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 6, 9, and 10 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 1 and 4 have 6 connections each.

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (2, 1): Node 2 has 1 connection and Node 1 has 6 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has 1 connection and Node 4 has 6 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (5, 6): Node 5 has 2 connections and Node 6 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (6, 5): Node 5 has 2 connections and Node 6 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (9, 6): Node 9 has 3 connections and Node 6 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (8, 9): Node 8 has 2 connections and Node 9 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (7, 9): Node 7 has 2 connections and Node 9 has 3 connections. Only one triangle is formed with Node 7, 9, and the shared connection with Node 6.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 1, and the unique triangle found is <7, 9, 6>. 

The final output is:
[1]
