Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degrees:
```
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
```

Vertices in order from least to most connections:
3, 2, 9, 7, 5, 8, 6, 4, 1, 0

Calculating triangles:
1. Looking at (3, 6), no triangle.
2. Looking at (2, 1), no triangle.
3. Looking at (9, 5):
    - Shared connection with 0, forming a triangle <0, 5, 9>.
4. Looking at (7, 1):
    - Shared connection with 4, forming a triangle <1, 4, 7>.
5. Looking at (5, 6):
    - Shared connection with 0, forming a triangle <0, 5, 6>.
    - Shared connection with 9, but already counted in step 3.
6. Looking at (8, 6):
    - Shared connection with 0, forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
7. Looking at (4, 6):
    - Shared connection with 0, forming a triangle <0, 4, 6>.
8. Looking at (1, 8):
    - Shared connection with 0, forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.
9. Looking at (0, 1):
    - Shared connection with 8, forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.
    - Shared connection with 4, forming a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
    - Shared connection with 5, forming a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
    - Shared connection with 9, forming a triangle <0, 1, 9>.
10. Looking at remaining edges, no more triangles.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 1, 8>
