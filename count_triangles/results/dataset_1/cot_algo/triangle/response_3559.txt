Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles.

Number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
