Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows:
Vertices sorted: 1, 4, 8, 0, 2, 6, 5, 9, 7, 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

1. Process edge (0, 3):
   - 0 is connected to: 3, 7, 8
   - 3 is connected to: 0, 1, 6, 7
   - Shared connections: 3, 7
   - Triangle <0, 3, 7>

2. Process edge (0, 7):
   - 0 is connected to: 3, 7, 8
   - 7 is connected to: 0, 3, 4, 5, 9
   - Shared connections: 0, 3, 7
   - Triangle <0, 3, 7>

3. Process edge (0, 8):
   - 0 is connected to: 3, 7, 8
   - 8 is connected to: 0, 2
   - Shared connections: 0
   - No triangle formed

4. Process edge (1, 2):
   - 1 is connected to: 2, 3, 4, 9
   - 2 is connected to: 1, 8
   - Shared connections: 1, 2
   - Triangle <1, 2, 8>

5. Process edge (1, 3):
   - 1 is connected to: 2, 3, 4, 9
   - 3 is connected to: 0, 1, 6, 7
   - Shared connections: 1, 3
   - Triangle <1, 3, 7>

6. Process edge (1, 4):
   - 1 is connected to: 2, 3, 4, 9
   - 4 is connected to: 1, 7
   - Shared connections: 1, 4
   - Triangle <1, 4, 7>

7. Process edge (1, 9):
   - 1 is connected to: 2, 3, 4, 9
   - 9 is connected to: 1, 5, 6, 7
   - Shared connections: 1, 9
   - Triangle <1, 9, 7>

Total number of triangles: [5]
