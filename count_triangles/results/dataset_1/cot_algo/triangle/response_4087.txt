Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices and their corresponding degrees:
- Vertex 1: Degree 2
- Vertex 2: Degree 5
- Vertex 3: Degree 3
- Vertex 5: Degree 2
- Vertex 7: Degree 4
- Vertex 8: Degree 3
- Vertex 9: Degree 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 1: Label 6
- Vertex 5: Label 4
- Vertex 9: Label 3
- Vertex 3: Label 5
- Vertex 8: Label 2
- Vertex 7: Label 1
- Vertex 2: Label 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Edge (1, 9): Check for shared connections (none)
- Edge (2, 3): Check for shared connections (none)
- Edge (2, 7): Check for shared connections (none)
- Edge (2, 8): Check for shared connections (none)
- Edge (2, 9): Check for shared connections (none)
- Edge (3, 5): Check for shared connections (no shared connections with lower labeled vertex)
- Edge (5, 7): Shared connection found, form a triangle <5, 3, 7>
- Edge (7, 2): Check for shared connections (no shared connections with lower labeled vertex)
- Edge (7, 8): Check for shared connections (no shared connections with lower labeled vertex)

The total number of triangles is 1, and the unique triangle found is <5, 3, 7>. 
Therefore, the final output is [1].
