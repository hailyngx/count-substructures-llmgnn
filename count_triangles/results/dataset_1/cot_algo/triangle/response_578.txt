Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  
Vertex 3 - connections: 1  
Vertex 4 - connections: 2  
Vertex 6 - connections: 2  
Vertex 9 - connections: 2  
Vertex 2 - connections: 3  
Vertex 7 - connections: 3  
Vertex 1 - connections: 4  
Vertex 0 - connections: 6  
Vertex 8 - connections: 7  
Vertex 5 - connections: 7  

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles formed by shared connections:

Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
