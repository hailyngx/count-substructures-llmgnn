Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their degree in increasing order and relabel them accordingly. 

Degree-based ordering:
Node 7: degree 0
Node 0: degree 2
Node 6: degree 1
Node 2: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 1: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 8: degree 6

Now we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.
