Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their degree:
Vertex 0: 4 connections 
Vertex 1: 3 connections 
Vertex 4: 2 connections 
Vertex 6: 2 connections 
Vertex 3: 2 connections 
Vertex 8: 2 connections 
Vertex 9: 3 connections 
Vertex 7: 2 connections 
Vertex 5: 1 connection 
Vertex 2: 1 connection 

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Start with the edge (5, 1): Continue
2. Start with the edge (6, 0): Continue -> Triangle found: <0, 6, 9>
3. Start with the edge (2, 7): Continue
4. Start with the edge (9, 8): Continue
5. Start with the edge (9, 3): Continue -> Triangle found: <3, 6, 9>
6. Start with the edge (4, 7): Continue -> Triangle found: <0, 4, 7>
7. Start with the edge (8, 1): Continue -> Triangle found: <1, 8, 9>
8. Start with the edge (3, 0): Continue -> Triangle found: <0, 3, 9>
9. Start with the edge (0, 1): Continue -> Triangle found: <0, 1, 8>
10. Start with the edge (7, 2): Continue

Total number of triangles: [5]
