Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are: <0, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 5>.
  
By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
