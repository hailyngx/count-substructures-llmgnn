Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 4 has 0 connections.
Nodes 0, 8 have 2 connections.
Nodes 1, 5 have 3 connections.
Nodes 2, 6, 7 have 4 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will consider the edges in the order: (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 8), (7, 1).

Using these edges, we find the following triangles: 
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
