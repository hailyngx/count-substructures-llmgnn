Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices by degree:
1. 1 (degree = 1)
2. 5 (degree = 1)
3. 6 (degree = 2)
4. 3 (degree = 0)
5. 0 (degree = 3)
6. 4 (degree = 3)
7. 7 (degree = 4)
8. 2 (degree = 5)
9. 8 (degree = 6)
10. 9 (degree = 6)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <0, 2, 9>
5. <4, 7, 8>
6. <4, 8, 9>
7. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
