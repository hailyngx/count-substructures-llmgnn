Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are:  

- Vertex 2 has 1 connection.  
- Vertices 0, 7, and 8 have 0 connections.  
- Vertices 1, 4, 5, and 9 have 4 connections.  
- Vertices 3 and 6 have 3 connections.  

Using this degree-based ordering, we can now count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
