Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 3

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 8: 0
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 2
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 5
- Node 7: 6
- Node 9: 7
- Node 2: 8
- Node 6: 9

Now, let's list the edges in the order of the lower labeled node:
(3, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (8, 2), (1, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9), (1, 9), (5, 7), (6, 7), (1, 9), (3, 9), (6, 9), (2, 9)

Now we count the triangles:
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <3, 1, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
