Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, we have the following order: 
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 0
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the given graph are:
[13]

Unique triangles:
