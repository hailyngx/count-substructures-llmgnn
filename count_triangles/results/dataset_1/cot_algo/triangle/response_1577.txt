Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 7 has 2 connections.
- Nodes 1, 3, and 8 have 2 connections.
- Nodes 4, 5, 8 have 3 connections.
- Nodes 2 and 9 have 5 connections.
- Node 0 has 6 connections.
- Node 6 has 7 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the following edges based on the vertex with the lower label and fewer connections:
- Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <1, 2, 0>
- Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <1, 9, 0>
- Edge (3, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <3, 0, 2>
- Edge (5, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <5, 4, 2>
- Edge (5, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <5, 6, 0>
- Edge (4, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 4 and 8: <4, 8, 0> 
- Edge (5, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 5 and 9: <5, 9, 0>
- Edge (6, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 6 and 7: <6, 7, 0>
- Edge (6, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 6 and 9: <6, 9, 0>
