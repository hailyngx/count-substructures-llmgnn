Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, we have the following relabeling: 

Node 3 -> 0
Node 8 -> 1
Node 6 -> 2
Node 1 -> 3
Node 2 -> 4
Node 9 -> 5
Node 0 -> 6
Node 7 -> 7
Node 4 -> 8
Node 5 -> 9

Now, we can list the triangles formed by the shared connections:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <1, 7, 8>
5. <2, 7, 8>
6. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
