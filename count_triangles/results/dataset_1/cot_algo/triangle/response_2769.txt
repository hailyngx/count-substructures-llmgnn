Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 5 (1 connection)
Node 6 (2 connections)
Node 3 (2 connections)
Node 9 (2 connections)
Node 1 (3 connections)
Node 7 (3 connections)
Node 0 (4 connections)
Node 4 (5 connections)
Node 8 (5 connections)
Node 2 (6 connections)

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. The triangles found are:
<2, 0, 4>
<4, 0, 7>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
