Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Sorting vertices by their number of connections:
- Vertex 1 has degree 4
- Vertex 3 has degree 2
- Vertex 5 has degree 2
- Vertex 7 has degree 2
- Vertex 2 has degree 2
- Vertex 8 has degree 4
- Vertex 9 has degree 2
- Vertex 0 has degree 4
- Vertex 4 has degree 6
- Vertex 6 has degree 5

Reordering the vertices:
- Vertex 1 (degree 4)
- Vertex 3 (degree 2)
- Vertex 5 (degree 2)
- Vertex 7 (degree 2)
- Vertex 2 (degree 2)
- Vertex 8 (degree 4)
- Vertex 9 (degree 2)
- Vertex 0 (degree 4)
- Vertex 4 (degree 6)
- Vertex 6 (degree 5)

Using Degree-Based Ordering to count triangles:
1. Edge (1, 3): No triangle formed
2. Edge (1, 5): No triangle formed
3. Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed
4. Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed
5. Edge (3, 4): No triangle formed
6. Edge (3, 6): No triangle formed
7. Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed
8. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed
9. Edge (7, 4): No triangle formed
10. Edge (7, 6): No triangle formed
11. Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed
12. Edge (2, 0): Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
13. Edge (5, 1): No triangle formed
14. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed
15. Edge (4, 0): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>
16. Edge (4, 3): No triangle formed
17. Edge (4, 6): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>
18. Edge (8, 0): Triangle formed: <0, 8, 5>
19. Edge (8, 6): Triangle formed: <0, 8, 6>
20. Edge (9, 0): No triangle formed
21. Edge (9, 6): No triangle formed

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 8, 5>
