Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we get the following list: 

Vertices: 8, 0, 7, 9, 5, 3, 4, 1, 6, 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can start counting triangles:

1. For edge (0, 2):
    Vertices 0 and 2 share a connection with vertex 6. 
    Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>

2. For edge (0, 8):
    No triangle is formed.

3. For edge (1, 3):
    Vertices 1 and 3 share a connection with vertex 6. 
    Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>

4. For edge (1, 4):
    Vertices 1 and 4 share a connection with vertex 2. 
    Triangle formed: <1, 2, 4>

5. For edge (1, 6):
    Vertices 1 and 6 share a connection with vertices 3 and 2, respectively. 
    Triangles formed: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 6>

6. For edge (1, 7):
    No triangle is formed.

7. For edge (2, 3):
    Vertices 2 and 3 share a connection with vertex 6. 
    Triangle formed: <2, 3, 6>

8. For edge (2, 4):
    Vertices 2 and 4 share a connection with vertex 1. 
    Triangle formed: <1, 2, 4>

9. For edge (2, 6):
    No new triangle is formed since it has been counted in edge (1, 6).

10. For edge (3, 1):
    No new triangle is formed since it has been counted in edge (1, 3).

11. For edge (3, 2):
    No new triangle is formed since it has been counted in edge (2, 3).

12. For edge (3, 6):
    No new triangle is formed.

13. For edge (3, 7):
    No triangle is formed.

14. For edge (4, 1):
    No new triangle is formed since it has been counted in edge (1, 4).

15. For edge (4, 2):
    No new triangle is formed since it has been counted in edge (2, 4).

16. For edge (4, 5):
    Vertices 4 and 5 share a connection with vertex 6. 
    Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>

17. For edge (4, 9):
    No triangle is formed.

18. For edge (5, 4):
    No new triangle is formed since it has been counted in edge (4, 5).

19. For edge (5, 6):
    No new triangle is formed since it has been counted in edge (4, 5).

20. For edge (5, 9):
    No triangle is formed.

21. For edge (6, 1):
    No new triangle is formed since it has been counted in edge (1, 6).

22. For edge (6, 2):
    No new triangle is formed since it has been counted in edge (2, 6).

23. For edge (6, 3):
    No new triangle is formed since it has been counted in edge (3, 6).

24. For edge (6, 5):
    No new triangle is formed since it has been counted in edge (5, 6).

25. For edge (6, 8):
    No triangle is formed.

26. For edge (7, 1):
    No triangle is formed.

27. For edge (7, 3):
    No triangle is formed.

28. For edge (8, 0):
    No triangle is formed.

29. For edge (8, 6):
    No new triangle is formed since it has been counted in edge (6, 8).

30. For edge (9, 4):
    No triangle is formed.

31. For edge (9, 5):
    No triangle is formed.
