Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 9: 0 connections
Node 5: 1 connection - Node 3
Node 4: 1 connection - Node 7
Node 1: 2 connections - Node 9, Node 8
Node 0: 2 connections - Node 6, Node 8
Node 5: 1 connection - Node 3
Node 3: 3 connections - Node 5, Node 7, Node 2
Node 8: 5 connections - Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 7
Node 2: 5 connections - Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 7, Node 8

Now, counting the triangles:
- Triangle <2, 3, 7>
- Triangle <1, 2, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
