Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:

Vertex 0: Degree 1
Vertex 1: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 2
Vertex 3: Degree 3
Vertex 4: Degree 3
Vertex 5: Degree 8
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 7
Vertex 9: Degree 2

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 3>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 0>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 8, 7>
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 8, 6>
<1, 8, 3>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
