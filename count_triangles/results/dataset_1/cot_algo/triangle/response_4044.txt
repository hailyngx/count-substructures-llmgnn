Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Then, we will relabel the vertices and count triangles based on the edges.

Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices: 1, 6, 8
Vertices: 5, 6, 8
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
Vertices: 0, 1, 2
Vertices: 0, 5, 6, 8
Vertices: 0, 5, 8
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6

Now, we will count the triangles based on the edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 1
Triangles: 2
Triangles: 1
Triangles: 3
Triangles: 1
Triangles: 0
Triangles: 0
Triangles: 0
Triangles: 0
Triangles: 1

Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles: 
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 7>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
