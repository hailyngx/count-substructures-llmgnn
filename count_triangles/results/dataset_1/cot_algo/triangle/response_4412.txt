Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering is as follows:
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Nodes 0, 2, 5, 7 have degree 2
- Nodes 1 has degree 4
- Nodes 4 has degree 4
- Nodes 3 has degree 5
- Nodes 8, 9 have degree 5

Using this ordering, we only proceed with edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 1): forms triangle with 4: <0, 1, 4>
2. Edge (0, 4): not considered
3. Edge (1, 2): forms triangle with 0: <1, 2, 0>
4. Edge (2, 3): not considered
5. Edge (3, 4): forms triangle with 0: <3, 4, 0>
6. Edge (6, 7): not considered
7. Edge (8, 9): forms triangle with 5: <8, 9, 5>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 0>, <3, 4, 0>
