Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 1: degree 5

Based on this ordering, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 is connected to Node 1. Checking shared connections, we find Node 1's neighbors are {0, 2, 8, 9}, and Node 0's neighbors are {1, 4}. There is 1 triangle: <0, 1, 4>.

2. Edge (0, 4): Node 0 is connected to Node 4. No triangles are formed as Node 4 has no other neighbors in the graph.

3. Edge (3, 7): Node 3 is connected to Node 7. No triangles are formed as Node 7 has no other neighbors in the graph.

4. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 is connected to Node 7. No triangles are formed as Node 7 has no other neighbors in the graph.

5. Edge (9, 1): Node 9 is connected to Node 1. No triangles are formed as Node 9 has no other neighbors in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [1].
Therefore, the unique triangle found is <0, 1, 4>.
