Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 0 has 2 connections.
Vertex 1 has 0 connections.
Vertex 2 has 2 connections.
Vertex 3 has 2 connections.
Vertex 4 has 5 connections.
Vertex 5 has 4 connections.
Vertex 6 has 2 connections.
Vertex 7 has 3 connections.
Vertex 8 has 3 connections.
Vertex 9 has 2 connections.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now analyze the edges:
- Edge (0, 4) is valid.
- Edge (0, 6) is valid.
- Edge (2, 4) is not valid since vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 4.
- Edge (2, 5) is valid.
- Edge (3, 5) is valid.
- Edge (3, 7) is valid.
- Edge (4, 0) is not valid since vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 4.
- Edge (4, 2) is valid.
- Edge (4, 7) is valid.
- Edge (4, 8) is valid.
- Edge (5, 2) is not valid since vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 5.
- Edge (5, 3) is valid.
- Edge (5, 8) is valid.
- Edge (5, 9) is valid.
- Edge (6, 0) is not valid since vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 6.
- Edge (6, 9) is valid.
- Edge (7, 3) is valid.
- Edge (7, 4) is valid.
- Edge (7, 8) is valid.
- Edge (8, 4) is not valid since vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 8.
- Edge (8, 5) is valid.
- Edge (8, 7) is valid.
- Edge (9, 5) is valid.
- Edge (9, 6) is valid.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 9>.
