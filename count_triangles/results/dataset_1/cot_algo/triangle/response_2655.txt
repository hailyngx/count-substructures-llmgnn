Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:

1. (0, 8) - Proceed
2. (0, 9) - Proceed
3. (1, 2) - Proceed
4. (1, 3) - Proceed
5. (1, 4) - Proceed
6. (1, 6) - Proceed
7. (1, 7) - Proceed
8. (2, 1) - Proceed
9. (2, 6) - Proceed
10. (3, 1) - Proceed
11. (3, 6) - Proceed
12. (3, 8) - Proceed
13. (4, 1) - Proceed
14. (4, 5) - Proceed
15. (4, 9) - Proceed
16. (5, 4) - Proceed
17. (5, 9) - Proceed
18. (6, 1) - Proceed
19. (6, 2) - Proceed
20. (6, 3) - Proceed
21. (6, 8) - Proceed
22. (7, 1) - Proceed
23. (8, 0) - Proceed
24. (8, 3) - Proceed
25. (8, 6) - Proceed
26. (9, 0) - Proceed
27. (9, 4) - Proceed
28. (9, 5) - Proceed

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<6, 1, 4>
<6, 1, 3>
<6, 1, 2>
<6, 1, 7>
<9, 4, 1>
<4, 1, 3>
<9, 4, 5>
<8, 3, 1>
