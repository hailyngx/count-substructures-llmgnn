Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

After relabeling the nodes accordingly, the edges to consider are:
(0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we find:
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <1, 2, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
