Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections, the order becomes: 

Nodes: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 1, 3, 7, 0

Following the degree-based ordering method, we analyze each edge to find the triangles. 

For the given graph, we find the following triangles:  
[<0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 9, 1>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 9, 2>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 7, 4>, <6, 7, 1>, <7, 8, 1>, <7, 9, 1>, <8, 9, 1>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
