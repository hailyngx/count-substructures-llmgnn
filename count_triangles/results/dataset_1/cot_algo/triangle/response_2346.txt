Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
- Node 0: degree 3  
- Node 4: degree 3  
- Node 6: degree 2  
- Node 3: degree 3  
- Node 5: degree 4  
- Node 7: degree 4  
- Node 1: degree 6  
- Node 8: degree 6  
- Node 2: degree 6  
- Node 9: degree 6  

Following the degree-based ordering method, we examine each edge to count the number of triangles.  

The total number of triangles is [10].  
The unique triangles found are:  
- <1, 2, 7>  
- <1, 2, 8>  
- <1, 2, 9>  
- <1, 3, 8>  
- <1, 4, 8>  
- <1, 8, 9>  
- <2, 7, 9>  
- <3, 4, 8>  
- <4, 8, 9>  
- <8, 9, 2>
