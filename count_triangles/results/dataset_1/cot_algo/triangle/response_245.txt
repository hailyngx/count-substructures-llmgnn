Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:  
Node 0: Degree 2  
Node 1: Degree 4  
Node 2: Degree 5  
Node 3: Degree 2  
Node 4: Degree 5  
Node 5: Degree 5  
Node 6: Degree 4  
Node 7: Degree 5  
Node 8: Degree 2  
Node 9: Degree 2  

Following the degree-based ordering, we analyze each edge to count the number of triangles:

1. (0, 4): Shared connections with node 7. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>.
2. (0, 7): No triangles formed.
3. (1, 3): No triangles formed.
4. (1, 5): Shared connections with nodes 2 and 6. Triangles formed: <1, 5, 2> and <1, 5, 6>.
5. (1, 6): Shared connection with node 2. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 2>.
6. (1, 7): Shared connection with node 5. Triangle formed: <1, 7, 5>.
7. (2, 3): Shared connection with node 5. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>.
8. (2, 5): No triangles formed.
9. (2, 6): Shared connections with nodes 1 and 7. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 1>.
10. (2, 7): Shared connection with node 1. Triangle formed: <2, 7, 1>.
11. (2, 8): No triangles formed.
12. (3, 1): No triangles formed.
13. (3, 2): Shared connection with node 5. Triangle formed: <3, 2, 5>.
14. (4, 0): Shared connections with nodes 5 and 7. Triangles formed: <4, 0, 5> and <4, 0, 7>.
15. (4, 5): No triangles formed.
16. (4, 6): Shared connection with node 7. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>.
17. (4, 7): Shared connection with node 0. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 0>.
18. (5, 1): No triangles formed.
19. (5, 2): Shared connections with nodes 1 and 6. Triangles formed: <5, 2, 1> and <5, 2, 6>.
20. (5, 4): Shared connection with node 0. Triangle formed: <5, 4, 0>.
21. (5, 9): No triangles formed.
22. (6, 1): Shared connection with node 2. Triangle formed: <6, 1, 2>.
23. (6, 2): Shared connections with nodes 1 and 7. Triangles formed: <6, 2, 1> and <6, 2, 7>.
24. (6, 4): Shared connection with node 7. Triangle formed: <6, 4, 7>.
25. (6, 7): Shared connection with node 2. Triangle formed: <6, 7, 2>.
26. (7, 0): Shared connection with node 4. Triangle formed: <7, 0, 4>.
27. (7, 1): No triangles formed.
28. (7, 2): Shared connection with node 6. Triangle formed: <7, 2, 6>.
29. (7, 4): Shared connection with node 6. Triangle formed: <7, 4, 6>.
30. (7, 6): Shared connection with node 2. Triangle formed: <7, 6, 2>.
31. (8, 2): No triangles formed.
32. (8, 9): No triangles formed.
33. (9, 5): No triangles formed.
34. (9, 8): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 7, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 7, 1>, <4, 0, 5>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 0>, <5, 2, 1>, <5, 2, 6>, <5, 4, 0>, <6, 1, 2>, <6, 2, 7>.
