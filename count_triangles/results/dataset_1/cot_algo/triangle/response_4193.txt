Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

- Node 2, 10, 0 have 0 connections.
- Node 1, 2, 7 have 1 connection each.
- Node 4 has 2 connections.
- Node 3 and 9 have 3 connections each.
- Node 5 and 8 have 4 connections each.
- Node 6 has 5 connections.

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on the connections:

- Node 0 (with 0 connections) -> Node A
- Node 1 (with 1 connection) -> Node B
- Node 7 (with 1 connection) -> Node C
- Node 4 (with 2 connections) -> Node D
- Node 3 (with 3 connections) -> Node E
- Node 9 (with 3 connections) -> Node F
- Node 5 (with 4 connections) -> Node G
- Node 8 (with 4 connections) -> Node H
- Node 6 (with 5 connections) -> Node I

Now, we will look at each edge to count the triangles formed:

- Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 3): Triangle formed with shared connection with Node C: <A, E, C>.
- Edge (5, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 8): Triangle formed with shared connection with Node E: <D, I, E>.
- Edge (6, 9): Triangle formed with shared connection with Node H: <F, I, H>.
- Edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 6): Triangle formed with shared connection with Node E: <D, H, E>.
- Edge (8, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 8): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles in the graph: [3]
Unique triangles found: <A, E, C>, <D, I, E>, <F, I, H>.
