Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: degree 1
Node 1: degree 0
Node 7: degree 0
Node 6: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 7: degree 0
Node 2: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6

Now, we relabel the nodes according to their degree in ascending order:

Node 1: degree 0
Node 7: degree 0
Node 0: degree 1
Node 6: degree 2
Node 2: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 7: degree 6
Node 4: degree 6

Next, we follow the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Checking edges: (0, 5), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 2), (6, 8), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we find that there are 4 triangles: <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, and <3, 8, 9>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
