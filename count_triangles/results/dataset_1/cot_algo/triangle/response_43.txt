Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Then, each edge is processed by considering the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections.

The sorted vertices are: 
Vertex 6 (Degree 2)
Vertex 8 (Degree 2)
Vertex 0 (Degree 2)
Vertex 5 (Degree 2)
Vertex 9 (Degree 2)
Vertex 1 (Degree 4)
Vertex 4 (Degree 4)
Vertex 3 (Degree 5)
Vertex 7 (Degree 5)
Vertex 2 (Degree 5)

Using this ordering, the triangles formed by the given edges are:
- <1, 2, 7>
- <1, 2, 3>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <3, 4, 2>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <7, 6, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
