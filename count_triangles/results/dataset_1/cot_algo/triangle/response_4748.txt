Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. In this graph:

Node 3 has 0 connections.
Nodes 5 and 9 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 1, 4, and 7 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 2 and 6 have 3 connections each.
Node 0 has 6 connections.
Node 8 has 7 connections.

Now, we will list the edges and identify triangles following the rules set earlier:

(0, 4): Node 4 has 2 connections, so we proceed.
Shared connections with Node 4: 0, 8
Triangle: <0, 4, 8>

(0, 5): Node 5 has 1 connection, so we proceed.
Shared connections with Node 5: 0
No triangles formed.

(0, 6): Node 6 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
Shared connections with Node 6: 0, 7
No triangles formed.

(0, 8): Node 8 has 7 connections, so we proceed.
Shared connections with Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 9
Triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 8>

(1, 2): Node 1 has 2 connections, so we proceed.
Shared connections with Node 1: 8
No triangles formed.

(1, 8): Node 8 has 7 connections, so we proceed.
Shared connections with Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 9
Triangles: <0, 1, 8>

(2, 7): Node 2 has 3 connections, so we proceed.
Shared connections with Node 2: 1
No triangles formed.

(4, 8): Node 4 has 2 connections, so we proceed.
Shared connections with Node 4: 0
No triangles formed.

(6, 7): Node 7 has 2 connections, so we proceed.
Shared connections with Node 7: 2
No triangles formed.

From the identified triangles, the total number of triangles present in the graph is [2].
