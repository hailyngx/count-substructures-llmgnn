Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the new order is: 1, 3, 7, 4, 6, 8, 9, 5, 0, 2.

Analyzing the edges based on the degree-based ordering method, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <0, 6, 5>
4. <0, 6, 9>
5. <1, 2, 9>
6. <2, 5, 8>
7. <2, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
