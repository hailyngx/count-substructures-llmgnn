Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 4: 0 connections
Nodes 1, 6: 2 connections
Nodes 3, 5: 3 connections
Nodes 2, 7, 8: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check for triangles while considering the sorted vertices.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
- Node 0 (1 connection) and Node 2 (4 connections) do not form a triangle.
- Node 1 and Node 5 (2 connections) form a triangle with Node 8 (4 connections) - <1, 5, 8>.
- Node 1 and Node 7 (2 connections) form a triangle with Node 5 (3 connections) - <1, 7, 5>.
- Node 1 and Node 8 (2 connections) do not form a triangle.
- Node 2 (4 connections) and Node 3 (3 connections) do not form a triangle.
- Node 2 and Node 8 (4 connections) do not form a triangle.
- Node 3 and Node 5 (3 connections) form a triangle with Node 8 (4 connections) - <3, 5, 8>.
- Node 5 and Node 7 (3 connections) form a triangle with Node 8 (4 connections) - <5, 7, 8>.
- Node 7 and Node 9 (2 connections) do not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
