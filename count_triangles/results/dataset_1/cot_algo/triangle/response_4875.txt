Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degrees of each vertex:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 2

Based on the degree-based ordering, we relabel the nodes as follows:
- Node 6: (label 0)
- Node 1: (label 1)
- Node 4: (label 2)
- Node 5: (label 3)
- Node 9: (label 4)
- Node 7: (label 5)
- Node 8: (label 6)
- Node 0: (label 7)
- Node 3: (label 8)
- Node 2: (label 9)

Now, we analyze the edges based on the new labels:
1. Edge (6, 3): Forms a triangle <0, 4, 8>
2. Edge (1, 9): No triangle is formed
3. Edge (2, 9): No triangle is formed
4. Edge (3, 8): Forms a triangle <0, 7, 8>
5. Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle <0, 2, 6>
6. Edge (5, 6): No triangle is formed
7. Edge (5, 7): No triangle is formed
8. Edge (7, 8): Forms a triangle <0, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, and <0, 2, 6>.
