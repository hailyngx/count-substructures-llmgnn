Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). The sorted list of vertices will be: 

0, 1, 9, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3, 7, 5

Next, we will check each edge based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections. 

Using this method, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<3, 5, 7>
