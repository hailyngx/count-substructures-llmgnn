Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The sorted list of vertices is: 7, 5, 6, 2, 5, 8, 4, 4, 9, 9

Now, we will examine each edge in the graph based on the vertex with the lower label:

Edge (1, 8): Both vertices have fewer connections than each other, continue.
Edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 has fewer connections. Check shared connections: 1-8-9, triangle found: <1, 8, 9>.
Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 has fewer connections, continue.
Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 has fewer connections, continue.
Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 has fewer connections, continue.
Edge (4, 3): Both vertices have the same degree, continue.
Edge (4, 8): Vertex 4 has fewer connections, continue.
Edge (4, 9): Vertex 4 has fewer connections, continue.
Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 has fewer connections, continue.
Edge (6, 2): Both vertices have fewer connections, continue.
Edge (8, 1): Vertex 1 has fewer connections, continue.
Edge (8, 4): Vertex 4 has fewer connections, continue.
Edge (8, 9): Vertex 8 has fewer connections, continue.
Edge (9, 1): Vertex 1 has fewer connections, continue.
Edge (9, 3): Vertex 3 has fewer connections, continue.
Edge (9, 4): Vertex 4 has fewer connections, continue.
Edge (9, 5): Vertex 5 has fewer connections, continue.

The total number of triangles found is 1, and the unique triangle is <1, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
