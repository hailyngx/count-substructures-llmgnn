Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 5 (1 connection)
- Node 2 (1 connection)
- Node 0 (2 connections)
- Node 5 (2 connections)
- Node 3 (3 connections)
- Node 8 (4 connections)
- Node 6 (4 connections)
- Node 7 (5 connections)
- Node 4 (5 connections)
- Node 9 (5 connections)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 9]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
