Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 1 (0 connections): 0
Node 9 (2 connections): 1
Node 4 (3 connections): 2
Node 6 (3 connections): 3
Node 8 (3 connections): 4
Node 0 (1 connection): 5
Node 3 (4 connections): 6
Node 7 (4 connections): 7
Node 5 (5 connections): 8
Node 2 (6 connections): 9

Next, we will analyze the edges following the lower labelled vertex having fewer connections rule to count triangles:

Triangles found:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
