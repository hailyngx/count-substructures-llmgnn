Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles efficiently in the provided graph.  
Below is the list of vertices and their corresponding degrees after sorting them:

0: Degree 2  
1: Degree 3  
2: Degree 2  
3: Degree 2  
4: Degree 3  
5: Degree 4  
6: Degree 1  
7: Degree 1  
8: Degree 4  
9: Degree 3  

We will now go through the edges, only considering cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  
As we go through each edge, we will count the number of triangles formed.  

Edge (0, 3): Shared connections with 1  
Edge (0, 4): Shared connections with 5  
Edge (1, 2): No triangles  
Edge (1, 3): Shared connections with 0  
Edge (1, 9): Shared connections with 2  
Edge (2, 9): Shared connections with 1  
Edge (3, 0): Shared connections with 1  
Edge (3, 1): Shared connections with 0  
Edge (4, 0): Shared connections with 5  
Edge (4, 5): Shared connections with 8  
Edge (4, 8): No triangles  
Edge (5, 4): Shared connections with 0  
Edge (5, 6): No triangles  
Edge (5, 7): No triangles  
Edge (5, 8): Shared connections with 4  
Edge (6, 5): No triangles  
Edge (7, 5): No triangles  
Edge (8, 4): Shared connections with 5  
Edge (8, 5): Shared connections with 4 and 9  
Edge (8, 9): Shared connections with 1 and 2  
Edge (9, 1): Shared connections with 2 and 8  
Edge (9, 2): Shared connections with 1 and 8  

Total number of triangles: [7]  
Unique triangles:  
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 4, 5>  
<0, 8, 4>  
<1, 2, 9>  
<1, 8, 9>  
<2, 8, 9>  
<4, 8, 5>
