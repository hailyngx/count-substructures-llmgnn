Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, we have the following list of vertices: 

Vertices: 4, 1, 7, 9, 3, 0, 5, 8, 6, 2

Now, we will go through the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Edges: 
1. (0, 2) -> Forms triangle with 5: <0, 2, 5>
2. (0, 5) -> Forms triangle with 2: <0, 5, 2>
3. (1, 2) -> No triangles formed.
4. (2, 0) -> Already counted.
5. (2, 1) -> No triangles formed.
6. (2, 5) -> Forms triangle with 0: <2, 5, 0>
7. (2, 6) -> Forms triangle with 3, 5, 9: <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 5>, <2, 6, 9>
8. (3, 6) -> Forms triangle with 2, 5, 9: <3, 6, 2>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 9>
9. (4, 8) -> No triangles formed.
10. (5, 0) -> Already counted.
11. (5, 2) -> Already counted.
12. (5, 8) -> Forms triangle with 4: <5, 8, 4>
13. (6, 2) -> Already counted.
14. (6, 3) -> Already counted.
15. (6, 7) -> Forms triangle with 9: <6, 7, 9>
16. (6, 9) -> Forms triangle with 2, 3, 7: <6, 9, 2>, <6, 9, 3>, <6, 9, 7>
17. (7, 6) -> Already counted.
18. (8, 4) -> No triangles formed.
19. (8, 5) -> Already counted.
20. (9, 6) -> Already counted.

Total number of triangles: [9]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 5>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 4>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 9, 2>
<6, 9, 3>
