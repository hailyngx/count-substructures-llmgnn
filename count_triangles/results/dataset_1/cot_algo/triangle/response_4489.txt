Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Degree-based ordering:
Node 7: Degree = 0
Node 0: Degree = 5
Node 1: Degree = 4
Node 5: Degree = 3
Node 2: Degree = 3
Node 8: Degree = 3
Node 7: Degree = 2
Node 9: Degree = 2
Node 3: Degree = 2
Node 4: Degree = 6

Sorted by degree:
Nodes: 7, 9, 3, 5, 8, 2, 1, 6, 0, 4

Triangles:
[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 0>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 0, 4>, <3, 0, 4>, <3, 2, 4>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 1>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 9, 6>, <5, 0, 1>, <5, 0, 6>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 5, 0>, <9, 4, 6>]
