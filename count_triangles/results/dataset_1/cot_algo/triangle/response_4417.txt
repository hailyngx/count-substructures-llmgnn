Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, we get the following relabeling:
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

- Edge (0, 3): 0 and 3 do not share a connection.
- Edge (0, 4): 0 and 4 do not share a connection.
- Edge (1, 5): 1 and 5 do not share a connection.
- Edge (1, 8): 1 and 8 do not share a connection.
- Edge (1, 9): 1 and 9 do not share a connection.
- Edge (2, 4): 2 and 4 share a connection with node 0, forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- Edge (2, 7): 2 and 7 do not share a connection.
- Edge (3, 6): 3 and 6 share a connection with node 5, forming triangle <3, 5, 6>.
- Edge (3, 8): 3 and 8 do not share a connection.
- Edge (4, 7): 4 and 7 share a connection with node 2, forming triangle <2, 4, 7>.
- Edge (5, 6): 5 and 6 do not share a connection.

Given the triangles found, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
