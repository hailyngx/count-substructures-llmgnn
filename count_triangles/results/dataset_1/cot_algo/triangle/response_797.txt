Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

1. For edge (0, 4):
   Shared connections: 9
2. For edge (0, 5):
   Shared connections: 8
3. For edge (0, 6):
   Shared connections: None
4. For edge (0, 8):
   Shared connections: 1, 3, 5
5. For edge (0, 9):
   Shared connections: None
6. For edge (1, 4):
   Shared connections: None
7. For edge (1, 8):
   Shared connections: None
8. For edge (2, 3):
   Shared connections: None
9. For edge (2, 7):
   Shared connections: None
10. For edge (3, 8):
    Shared connections: None
11. For edge (4, 9):
    Shared connections: None
12. For edge (5, 6):
    Shared connections: None
13. For edge (5, 7):
    Shared connections: None
14. For edge (5, 8):
    Shared connections: None
15. For edge (6, 7):
    Shared connections: None
16. For edge (7, 9):
    Shared connections: None
17. For edge (8, 9):
    Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: 
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
