Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The sorted list of vertices with their corresponding degrees is as follows: 

- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 6
- Vertex 3: degree 6
- Vertex 2: degree 4

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
- Then, we check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to count the triangles.

Following these steps, we find that the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
