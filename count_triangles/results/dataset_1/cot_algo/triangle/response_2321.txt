Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the new labeling of nodes as follows:
Nodes: 7, 8, 9, 2, 4, 8, 1, 6, 0, 3
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 2), (3, 1), (4, 6), (5, 8), (1, 4), (1, 7), (6, 7), (6, 5), (8, 9), (9, 4)

Now, we will determine the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For edge (0, 3):
   - Node 0 has connections with nodes {2, 5, 6}.
   - Node 3 has connections with nodes {1, 2, 9}.
   - Shared connection: Node 2 forms a triangle.
  
2. For edge (0, 5):
   - Node 0 has connections with nodes {2, 3, 6}.
   - Node 5 has connections with nodes {1, 6, 8}.
   - Shared connection: Node 6 forms a triangle.

3. For edge (0, 6):
   - Node 0 has connections with nodes {2, 3, 5}.
   - Node 6 has connections with nodes {4, 5, 7}.
   - Shared connection: Node 5 forms a triangle.

4. For edge (0, 2):
   - Node 0 has connections with nodes {3, 5, 6}.
   - Node 2 has connections with nodes {0, 3}.
   - Shared connection: Node 3 forms a triangle.

5. For edge (3, 1):
   - Node 3 has connections with nodes {0, 2, 9}.
   - Node 1 has connections with nodes {4, 5, 7}.
   - Shared connection: None.

6. For edge (4, 6):
   - Node 4 has connections with nodes {1, 9}.
   - Node 6 has connections with nodes {0, 5, 7}.
   - Shared connection: None.

7. For edge (5, 8):
   - Node 5 has connections with nodes {0, 1, 6}.
   - Node 8 has connections with nodes {9}.
   - Shared connection: None.

8. For edge (1, 4):
   - Node 1 has connections with nodes {3, 5, 7}.
   - Node 4 has connections with nodes {6, 9}.
   - Shared connection: None.

9. For edge (1, 7):
   - Node 1 has connections with nodes {3, 4, 5}.
   - Node 7 has connections with nodes {6}.
   - Shared connection: None.

10. For edge (6, 7):
    - Node 6 has connections with nodes {0, 4, 5}.
    - Node 7 has connections with nodes {1}.
    - Shared connection: None.

11. For edge (6, 5):
    - Node 6 has connections with nodes {0, 4, 7}.
    - Node 5 has connections with nodes {0, 1, 8}.
    - Shared connection: None.

12. For edge (8, 9):
    - Node 8 has connections with nodes {5, 9}.
    - Node 9 has connections with nodes {3, 4, 8}.
    - Shared connection: None.
