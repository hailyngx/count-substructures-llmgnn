Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degrees of each vertex:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 4

Now, we will reorder the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0 (degree 2) becomes Node 0
- Node 1 (degree 2) becomes Node 1
- Node 2 (degree 2) becomes Node 2
- Node 3 (degree 2) becomes Node 3
- Node 7 (degree 2) becomes Node 4
- Node 5 (degree 3) becomes Node 5
- Node 8 (degree 4) becomes Node 6

Now, we will list the edges based on the new ordering:
- (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 4) (3, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (4, 6)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the shared connections:
- From (0, 1): Found 1 triangle <0, 1, 5>
- From (0, 3): No triangles formed
- From (1, 5): Found 1 triangle <0, 1, 5>
- From (2, 5): No triangles formed
- From (2, 4): No triangles formed
- From (3, 4): No triangles formed
- From (5, 1): Found 1 triangle <0, 1, 5>
- From (5, 6): Found 1 triangle <1, 5, 6>
- From (5, 4): Found 1 triangle <0, 5, 6>
- From (4, 6): Found 1 triangle <0, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, and <0, 5, 6>.
