Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Nodes in increasing order of connections: 1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 1, 7, 3, 5, 2 

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Node 0 was originally connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 7
Node 1 was originally connected to nodes 2, 3
Node 2 was originally connected to nodes 0, 1, 7 
Node 3 was originally connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 8
Node 4 was originally connected to nodes 0, 5, 6
Node 5 was originally connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 6 was originally connected to nodes 3, 4
Node 7 was originally connected to nodes 0, 2, 5
Node 8 was originally connected to nodes 3
Node 9 was originally connected to nodes 5

Now, we will count the triangles using Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge: (0, 2)
    Node 0 shares connections with: 4, 5, 7
    Triangle: <0, 4, 7>

2. Edge: (0, 4)
    Node 0 shares connections with: 2, 5
    Triangle: <0, 2, 5>

3. Edge: (0, 5)
    Node 0 shares connections with: 2, 4, 7
    Triangle: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 2, 7>

4. Edge: (0, 7)
    Node 0 shares connections with: 2, 4, 5
    Triangle: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>

5. Edge: (1, 2)
    Node 1 shares connections with: 3
    No triangle formed.

6. Edge: (1, 3)
    Node 1 shares connections with: 2
    No triangle formed.

7. Edge: (2, 0)
    Node 2 shares connections with: 1, 7
    Triangle: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 2>

8. Edge: (2, 1)
    Node 2 shares connections with: 7
    No triangle formed.

9. Edge: (2, 7)
    Node 2 shares connections with: 0, 1
    Triangle: <0, 1, 2>

Total number of triangles: [6]
