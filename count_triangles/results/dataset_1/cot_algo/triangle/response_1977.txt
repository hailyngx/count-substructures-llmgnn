Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by the number of connections they have:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Now we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Node 0 -> A
Node 2 -> B
Node 4 -> C
Node 5 -> D
Node 6 -> E
Node 9 -> F
Node 7 -> G
Node 8 -> H
Node 1 -> I
Node 3 -> J

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

For edge (0, 1):
- Node A (0) has 2 connections and Node I (1) has 6 connections.
- Proceed with Node A.
- Shared connections between A and I are: 3, 5.
- Therefore, triangle <0, 1, 3> is found.

For edge (0, 3):
- Node A (0) has 2 connections and Node J (3) has 6 connections.
- Proceed with Node A.
- Shared connections between A and J are: 1.
- Therefore, no additional triangles are found.

Continuing this process for all edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
