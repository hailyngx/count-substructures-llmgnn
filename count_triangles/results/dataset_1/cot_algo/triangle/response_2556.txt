Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their connections from least to most:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Now, we will re-label the vertices accordingly:

Node 0 -> Node 0
Node 3 -> Node 1
Node 7 -> Node 2
Node 9 -> Node 3
Node 5 -> Node 4
Node 1 -> Node 5
Node 4 -> Node 6
Node 6 -> Node 7
Node 8 -> Node 8
Node 2 -> Node 9

Now, we will count the triangles. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 4): No triangle formed.
2. Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (1, 5): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (1, 9): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 6): Triangle <5, 6, 2> is formed.
8. Edge (2, 7): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (2, 8): Triangle <8, 6, 2> is formed.
10. Edge (3, 4): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (3, 5): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (4, 6): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (4, 8): Triangle <8, 6, 4> is formed.
14. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (6, 8): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed.

Count of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <5, 6, 2>, <8, 6, 2>, <8, 6, 4>
