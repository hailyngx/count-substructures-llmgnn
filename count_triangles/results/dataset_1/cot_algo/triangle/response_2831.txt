Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
