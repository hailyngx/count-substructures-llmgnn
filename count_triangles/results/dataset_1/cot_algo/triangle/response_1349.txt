Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8)
