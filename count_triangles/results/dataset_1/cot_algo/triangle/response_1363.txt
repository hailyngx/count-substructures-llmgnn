Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 

0 (degree 3), 2 (degree 2), 6 (degree 1), 3 (degree 2), 8 (degree 2), 5 (degree 3), 7 (degree 3), 9 (degree 4), 1 (degree 5), 4 (degree 5).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
Edges that form triangles are: (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 4), (0, 4, 9), (1, 4, 7), (1, 4, 9), (1, 5, 2), (1, 5, 7), (1, 7, 9), (4, 7, 9).

Counting all the unique triangles, we get:
[9]

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>.
