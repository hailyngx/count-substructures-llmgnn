Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 0 connections
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 10: 0 connections

Relabeling the vertices based on connections:

Node 4 (0 connections) -> 1
Node 5 (0 connections) -> 2
Node 3 (1 connection) -> 3
Node 1 (2 connections) -> 4
Node 6 (3 connections) -> 5
Node 8 (3 connections) -> 6
Node 9 (3 connections) -> 7
Node 2 (4 connections) -> 8
Node 7 (4 connections) -> 9
Node 10 (0 connections) -> 10

Now, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(1, 7): Both have 2 connections. Not considered.
(2, 7): Vertex 2 has 4 connections, so not considered.
(2, 8): Vertex 2 has 4 connections, so not considered.
(2, 9): Vertex 2 has 4 connections, so not considered.
(3, 6): Vertex 3 has 1 connection and Vertex 6 has 3 connections. Possible triangle: <3, 6, 9>.
(6, 3): Same edge as (3, 6).
(6, 9): Vertex 3 has 1 connection and Vertex 9 has 3 connections. Possible triangle: <3, 6, 9>.
(7, 1): Both have 2 connections. Not considered.
(7, 2): Vertex 7 has 4 connections, so not considered.
(7, 8): Vertex 7 has 4 connections, so not considered.
(8, 2): Vertex 8 has 3 connections and Vertex 2 has 4 connections. Possible triangle: <3, 6, 9>.
(8, 7): Vertex 8 has 3 connections and Vertex 7 has 4 connections. Not considered.
(9, 2): Vertex 9 has 3 connections and Vertex 2 has 4 connections. Possible triangle: <3, 6, 9>.
(9, 6): Vertex 9 has 3 connections and Vertex 6 has 3 connections. Possible triangle: <3, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <3, 6, 9>.
