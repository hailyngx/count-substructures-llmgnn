Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

0: degree 2
1: degree 3
5: degree 1
6: degree 1
7: degree 1
4: degree 3
8: degree 2
3: degree 3
9: degree 4
2: degree 8

Now, we will check each edge while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 2): Both have degree 2. No new triangles.
2. Edge (0, 3): 0 has degree 2, and 3 has degree 3. No new triangles.
3. Edge (1, 2): 1 has degree 3, and 2 has degree 8. We find the triangle <1, 2, 0>.
4. Edge (1, 4): Both have degree 3. No new triangles.
5. Edge (1, 8): 1 has degree 3, and 8 has degree 2. No new triangles.
6. Edge (2, 0): 0 has degree 2, and 2 has degree 8. No new triangles.
7. Edge (2, 1): 1 has degree 3, and 2 has degree 8. No new triangles.
8. Edge (2, 3): 2 has degree 8, and 3 has degree 3. We find the triangle <2, 3, 0>.
9. Edge (2, 4): 2 has degree 8, and 4 has degree 3. We find the triangle <2, 4, 1>.
10. Edge (2, 5): 2 has degree 8, and 5 has degree 1. No new triangles.
11. Edge (2, 7): 2 has degree 8, and 7 has degree 1. No new triangles.
12. Edge (2, 9): 2 has degree 8, and 9 has degree 4. We find the triangle <2, 9, 3>.
13. Edge (3, 0): 0 has degree 2, and 3 has degree 3. No new triangles.
14. Edge (3, 2): 2 has degree 8, and 3 has degree 3. We've already counted this triangle.
15. Edge (3, 9): 3 has degree 3, and 9 has degree 4. We find the triangle <3, 9, 2>.
16. Edge (4, 1): 1 has degree 3, and 4 has degree 3. We've already counted this triangle.
17. Edge (4, 2): 2 has degree 8, and 4 has degree 3. We've already counted this triangle.
18. Edge (4, 6): 4 has degree 3, and 6 has degree 1. No new triangles.
19. Edge (5, 2): 2 has degree 8, and 5 has degree 1. No new triangles.
20. Edge (6, 4): 4 has degree 3, and 6 has degree 1. No new triangles.
21. Edge (7, 2): 2 has degree 8, and 7 has degree 1. No new triangles.
22. Edge (8, 1): 1 has degree 3, and 8 has degree 2. No new triangles.
23. Edge (8, 9): 8 has degree 2, and 9 has degree 4. No new triangles.
24. Edge (9, 2): 2 has degree 8, and 9 has degree 4. We've already counted this triangle.
25. Edge (9, 3): 3 has degree 3, and 9 has degree 4. We've already counted this triangle.
26. Edge (9, 8): 8 has degree 2, and 9 has degree 4. No new triangles.
