Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get:  
Node 0 has 2 connections  
Node 7 has 2 connections  
Node 8 has 3 connections  
Node 5 has 3 connections  
Node 4 has 3 connections  
Node 9 has 3 connections  
Node 6 has 4 connections  
Node 1 has 4 connections  
Node 3 has 4 connections  
Node 2 has 4 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles:  
- For the edge (0, 3), we have a triangle <0, 3, 2>.  
- For the edge (0, 8), we don't have any triangles.  
- For the edge (1, 4), we have a triangle <1, 4, 7>.  
- For the edge (1, 5), we have a triangle <1, 5, 6>.  
- For the edge (1, 7), we don't have any triangles.  
- For the edge (1, 9), we don't have any triangles.  
- For the edge (2, 3), we have a triangle <2, 3, 6>.  
- For the edge (2, 5), we have a triangle <2, 5, 6>.  
- For the edge (2, 6), we have a triangle <2, 6, 3>.  
- For the edge (3, 0), we already counted this triangle.  
- For the edge (3, 2), we already counted this triangle.  
- For the edge (3, 6), we have a triangle <3, 6, 5>.  
- For the edge (4, 1), we already counted this triangle.  
- For the edge (4, 7), we don't have any triangles.  
- For the edge (4, 8), we don't have any triangles.  
- For the edge (5, 1), we already counted this triangle.  
- For the edge (5, 2), we already counted this triangle.  
- For the edge (5, 6), we have a triangle <5, 6, 2>.  
- For the edge (6, 2), we already counted this triangle.  
- For the edge (6, 3), we already counted this triangle.  
- For the edge (6, 5), we already counted this triangle.  
- For the edge (6, 8), we don't have any triangles.  
- For the edge (7, 1), we already counted this triangle.  
- For the edge (7, 4), we don't have any triangles.  
- For the edge (8, 0), we don't have any triangles.  
- For the edge (8, 4), we don't have any triangles.  
- For the edge (8, 6), we don't have any triangles.  
- For the edge (9, 1), we don't have any triangles.  
- For the edge (9, 2), we don't have any triangles.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 2>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <5, 6, 2>.
