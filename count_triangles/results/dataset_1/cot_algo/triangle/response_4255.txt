Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 10: degree 0
- Vertex 2: degree 5
- Vertex 9: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 8, 9>

<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<5, 9, 2>
<8, 1, 9>
<8, 2, 9>
