Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertices are:  
Node 0 has degree 2  
Node 1 has degree 2  
Node 2 has degree 2  
Node 5 has degree 2  
Node 7 has degree 2  
Node 4 has degree 3  
Node 9 has degree 3  
Node 8 has degree 4  
Node 6 has degree 4  
Node 3 has degree 5  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in this graph:

We can see that nodes with lower labels only have fewer connections with higher labeled nodes. So, we can count the triangles formed by the edges as follows:  
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 8>  
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 8>  
- Triangle 3: <2, 6, 9>  
- Triangle 4: <3, 4, 5>  
- Triangle 5: <3, 6, 8>  
- Triangle 6: <3, 6, 9>  
- Triangle 7: <4, 6, 8>  
- Triangle 8: <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
