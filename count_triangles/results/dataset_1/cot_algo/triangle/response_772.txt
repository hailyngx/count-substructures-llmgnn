Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly.

Vertices sorted by their degree:
0 (degree 5)
8 (degree 3)
4 (degree 3)
7 (degree 3)
2 (degree 3)
9 (degree 4)
1 (degree 5)
5 (degree 5)
3 (degree 4)

Now, we will count the triangles by considering each edge. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
