Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 
0 (degree 3)
1 (degree 2)
2 (degree 3)
3 (degree 2)
4 (degree 3)
5 (degree 4)
6 (degree 4)
7 (degree 2)
8 (degree 1)
9 (degree 6)

Now we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 
8 (degree 1)
1 (degree 2)
3 (degree 2)
7 (degree 2)
2 (degree 3)
4 (degree 3)
0 (degree 3)
6 (degree 4)
5 (degree 4)
9 (degree 6)

Next, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to find the number of triangles:
- Starting with edge (0, 1): No triangles formed.
- Moving to edge (0, 5): Triangle formed with vertex 0, 5, and their shared connection 3. Triangle <0, 3, 5>.
- Moving to edge (0, 7): No triangles formed.
- Moving to edge (1, 6): No triangles formed.
- Moving to edge (2, 6): Triangle formed with vertex 2, 6, and their shared connection 3. Triangle <2, 3, 6>.
- Moving to edge (2, 9): Triangle formed with vertex 2, 9, and their shared connection 6. Triangle <2, 6, 9>.
- Moving to edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
- Moving to edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.
- Moving to edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
- Moving to edge (4, 9): Triangle formed with vertex 4, 9, and their shared connection 6. Triangle <4, 6, 9>.
- Moving to edge (5, 9): Triangle formed with vertex 5, 9, and their shared connection 6. Triangle <5, 6, 9>.
- Moving to edge (6, 1): No triangles formed.
- Moving to edge (6, 2): No triangles formed.
- Moving to edge (6, 3): No triangles formed.
- Moving to edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.
- Moving to edge (7, 0): No triangles formed.
- Moving to edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
- Moving to edge (8, 9): No triangles formed.
- No triangles found in the last edge (9, 5) as the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- No triangles found in the last edge (9, 4) as the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- No triangles found in the last edge (9, 6) as the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- No triangles found in the last edge (9, 8) as the lower labeled vertex has more connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <5, 6, 9>.
