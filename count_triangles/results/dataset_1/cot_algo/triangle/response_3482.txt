Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 1 has degree 3
- Vertex 3 has degree 3
- Vertex 4 has degree 1
- Vertex 9 has degree 1
- Vertex 8 has degree 2
- Vertex 6 has degree 4
- Vertex 7 has degree 3
- Vertex 5 has degree 4
- Vertex 2 has degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle <3, 5, 6>
- Triangle <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
