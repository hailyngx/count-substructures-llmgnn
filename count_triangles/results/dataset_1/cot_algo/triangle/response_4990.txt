Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Node 4: 0 connections   
Node 6: 0 connections   
Node 9: 0 connections   
Node 5: 1 connection   
Node 7: 2 connections  
Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 3: 3 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 2]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 5, 7>
