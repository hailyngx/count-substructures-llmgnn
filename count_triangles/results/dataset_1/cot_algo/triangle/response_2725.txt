Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The vertices with their degrees are:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 3
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 1

The vertices sorted by degree are:
- Vertex 9 (degree 1)
- Vertices 0, 1, 4, 5 (degree 2)
- Vertices 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 (degree 3)

We will now proceed with counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <2, 6, 7>
2. <2, 3, 6>
3. <2, 3, 8>
4. <3, 7, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 4]
