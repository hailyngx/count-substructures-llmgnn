Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

Checking (1, 2):
Vertex 1 (degree 5) < Vertex 2 (degree 2), checking common neighbors.
Common neighbors: 7
Triangle found: <1, 2, 7>

Checking (1, 5):
Vertex 1 (degree 5) < Vertex 5 (degree 2), checking common neighbors.
Common neighbors: 7
Triangle found: <1, 5, 7>

Checking (1, 7):
Vertex 1 (degree 5) < Vertex 7 (degree 6), checking common neighbors.
Common neighbors: 2, 5, 9
Triangles found: <1, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 9>

Checking (1, 8):
Vertex 1 (degree 5) < Vertex 8 (degree 2), checking common neighbors.
No triangle found.

Checking (1, 9):
Vertex 1 (degree 5) < Vertex 9 (degree 3), checking common neighbors.
Common neighbors: 7
Triangle found: <1, 9, 7>

Checking (2, 7):
Vertex 2 (degree 2) < Vertex 7 (degree 6), checking common neighbors.
Common neighbors: 1
Triangle found: <2, 7, 1>

Checking (3, 9):
