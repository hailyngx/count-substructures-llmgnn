Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). The sorted list of vertices would be: <3, 4, 9, 5, 6, 2, 0, 1, 8, 7>.

Next, we will go through the edges one by one:

1. Edge (0, 7): Both vertices have fewer connections than each other, so we proceed. Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 7, forming triangle <0, 7, 9>.
2. Edge (0, 8): Both vertices have fewer connections than each other, so we proceed. Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 8, forming triangle <0, 8, 6>.
3. Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has fewer connections, so we proceed. There are no shared connections between vertices 1 and 2.
4. Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
5. Edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
6. Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
7. Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
8. Edge (2, 1): Vertex 1 has fewer connections, so we proceed. There are no shared connections between vertices 1 and 2.
9. Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 has fewer connections, so we proceed. There are no shared connections between vertices 2 and 7.
10. Edge (5, 1): Vertex 1 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
11. Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5 has fewer connections, so we proceed. There are no shared connections between vertices 5 and 8.
12. Edge (6, 1): Vertex 1 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
13. Edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 has fewer connections, so we proceed. There are no shared connections between vertices 6 and 8.
14. Edge (7, 0): Vertex 0 has fewer connections, so we proceed. Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 7, 9>.
15. Edge (7, 1): Vertex 1 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
16. Edge (7, 2): Vertex 2 has fewer connections, so we proceed. There are no shared connections between vertices 2 and 7.
17. Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
18. Edge (8, 0): Vertex 0 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
19. Edge (8, 1): Vertex 1 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
20. Edge (8, 5): Vertex 5 has fewer connections, so we proceed. There are no shared connections between vertices 5 and 8.
21. Edge (8, 6): Vertex 6 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
22. Edge (8, 9): Vertex 8 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
23. Edge (9, 7): Vertex 9 has fewer connections, so we proceed. Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 7, forming triangle <0, 7, 9>.
24. Edge (9, 8): Vertex 9 has fewer connections, so we proceed. Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 8, forming triangle <0, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
