Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves ordering the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the list of vertices ordered from least connections to most connections:
Vertices: 2, 1, 4, 9, 8, 6, 0, 3, 7, 5

Using this ordering, we can examine each edge to find triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Both 0 and 2 have connections with 5. So, we have a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 5): Both 0 and 5 have connections with 8. So, we have a triangle <0, 5, 8>.
3. Edge (0, 8): Both 0 and 8 have connections with 5. So, we have a triangle <0, 8, 5>.
4. Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (2, 0): Already counted.
6. Edge (2, 3): Both 2 and 3 have connections with 7. So, we have a triangle <2, 3, 7>.
7. Edge (3, 2): Already counted.
8. Edge (3, 7): Both 3 and 7 have connections with 4. So, we have a triangle <3, 7, 4>.
9. Edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (4, 8): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (5, 0): Already counted.
12. Edge (5, 1): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (5, 8): Already counted.
14. Edge (5, 9): Both 5 and 9 have connections with 6. So, we have a triangle <5, 9, 6>.
15. Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (7, 3): Already counted.
18. Edge (7, 4): Already counted.
19. Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
20. Edge (8, 0): Already counted.
21. Edge (8, 4): Already counted.
22. Edge (8, 5): Already counted.
23. Edge (9, 5): Already counted.
24. Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, and <2, 3, 7>.
