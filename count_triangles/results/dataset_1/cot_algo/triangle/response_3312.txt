Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, the new numbering of the vertices is as follows:

Vertex 0 has 4 connections.
Vertex 1 has 2 connections.
Vertex 2 has 3 connections.
Vertex 3 has 3 connections.
Vertex 4 has 3 connections.
Vertex 5 has 3 connections.
Vertex 6 has 5 connections.
Vertex 8 has 3 connections.
Vertex 9 has 2 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start exploring edges with the lowest labeled vertex having fewer connections. 

Reviewing the edges that match this criteria, we find the following triangles:

<1, 0, 6>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 0, 4>
<5, 4, 8>
<6, 0, 4>
<6, 1, 0>
<6, 1, 6>
<6, 2, 3>
<6, 2, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
