Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the labels will be as follows:
- Node 7 (degree 6)
- Node 1 (degree 7)
- Node 5 (degree 7)
- Node 4 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 4)
- Node 9 (degree 4)
- Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 8 (degree 3)
- Node 2 (degree 1)
- Node 3 (degree 2)

Following the given method, we can find the triangles in the graph:

1. For edge (0, 7):
   - Node 0's connections: 7, 8
   - Node 7's connections: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
   - Triangles: <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 5>

2. For edge (1, 3):
   - Node 1's connections: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
   - Node 3's connections: 1, 5
   - Triangles: <1, 3, 5>

3. For edge (1, 4):
   - Node 1's connections: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
   - Node 4's connections: 1, 6, 7
   - Triangles: <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>

4. For edge (1, 5):
   - Node 1's connections: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
   - Node 5's connections: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
   - Triangles: <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>

   - Node 6's connections: 1, 4, 7, 9
   - Triangles: <1, 6, 4>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>

6. For edge (1, 7):
   - Node 1's connections: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
   - Node 7's connections: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
   - Triangles: <1, 7, 0>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 6>

7. For edge (1, 9):
   - Node 1's connections: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
   - Node 9's connections: 1, 5, 6, 8
   - Triangles: <1, 9, 5>, <1, 9, 6>

8. For edge (5, 7):
   - Node 5's connections: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
