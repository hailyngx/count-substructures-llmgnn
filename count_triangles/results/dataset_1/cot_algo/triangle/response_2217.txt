Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels are as follows: 

Node 3 (degree 4)
Node 1 (degree 2)
Node 5 (degree 2)
Node 7 (degree 2)
Node 0 (degree 5)
Node 8 (degree 3)
Node 9 (degree 3)
Node 2 (degree 4)
Node 6 (degree 4)
Node 4 (degree 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <3, 2, 6>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <4, 6, 9>
7. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
