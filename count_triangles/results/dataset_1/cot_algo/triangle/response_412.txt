Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 5: degree 1
Node 9: degree 1
Node 2: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 7: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 6: degree 6
Node 8: degree 0

Now, we will enumerate the nodes accordingly:
Node 8 -> 0
Node 5 -> 1
Node 9 -> 2
Node 0 -> 3
Node 2 -> 4
Node 4 -> 5
Node 3 -> 6
Node 1 -> 7
Node 7 -> 8
Node 6 -> 9

Now, we will start counting the triangles based on the lower-labeled node having fewer connections:

Triangles: 
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
