Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices in ascending order based on their degrees: 8, 9, 0, 6, 1, 8, 5, 7, 3, 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 0 (degree 1) is relabeled as 0
Vertex 1 (degree 2) is relabeled as 1
Vertex 2 (degree 3) is relabeled as 2
Vertex 3 (degree 2) is relabeled as 3
Vertex 4 (degree 4) is relabeled as 4
Vertex 5 (degree 2) is relabeled as 5
Vertex 6 (degree 1) is relabeled as 6
Vertex 7 (degree 2) is relabeled as 7
Vertex 8 (degree 1) is relabeled as 8
Vertex 9 (degree 1) is relabeled as 9

Now, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 5) => Vertices: 0 (degree 1), 5 (degree 2) => Shared connection: None
(1, 2) => Vertices: 1 (degree 2), 2 (degree 3) => Shared connection: None
(2, 4) => Vertices: 2 (degree 3), 4 (degree 4) => Shared connection: None
(2, 7) => Vertices: 2 (degree 3), 7 (degree 2) => Shared connection: None
(3, 4) => Vertices: 3 (degree 2), 4 (degree 4) => Shared connection: None
(4, 6) => Vertices: 4 (degree 4), 6 (degree 1) => Shared connection: None
(5, 7) => Vertices: 5 (degree 2), 7 (degree 2) => Shared connection: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles []: 0
No triangles were found in the given graph.
