Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following labels for each node:
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 1
- Node 9: Degree 2

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the triangles formed by shared connections. 

The total number of triangles is [12], and the unique triangles found are:
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <1, 5, 3>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <3, 6, 4>
- <1, 3, 2>
