Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 6 (degree 1)  
Node 9 (degree 1)  
Node 0 (degree 2)  
Node 5 (degree 2)  
Node 1 (degree 3)  
Node 2 (degree 3)  
Node 8 (degree 4)  
Node 4 (degree 5)  
Node 3 (degree 6)  

Now, following the degree-based ordering method:

Edge: (0, 4)
Node 0: {4, 3}  
Node 4: {3, 0, 5, 8}  
Shared connections: 3  
Triangle(s): <0, 3, 4>  

Edge: (1, 3)
Node 1: {3, 8}  
Node 3: {1, 2, 4}  
Shared connections: 1  
Triangle(s):  

Edge: (1, 8)
Node 1: {3, 8}  
Node 8: {1, 2, 4}  
Shared connections: 1  
Triangle(s):  

Edge: (2, 3)
Node 2: {3, 8}  
Node 3: {1, 2, 4}  
Shared connections: 1  
Triangle(s):  

Edge: (2, 8)
Node 2: {3, 8}  
Node 8: {1, 2, 4}  
Shared connections: 1  
Triangle(s):  

Edge: (3, 4)
Node 3: {1, 2, 4}  
Node 4: {3, 0, 5, 8}  
Shared connections: 1  
Triangle(s):  

Edge: (4, 5)
Node 4: {3, 0, 5, 8}  
Node 5: {4}  
Shared connections: 1  
Triangle(s):  

Edge: (4, 8)
Node 4: {3, 0, 5, 8}  
Node 8: {1, 2, 4}  
Shared connections: 1  
Triangle(s):  

Edge: (6, 9)
Node 6: {9}  
Node 9: {6}  
Shared connections: 0  
Triangle(s):  

Number of triangles in the graph: [1]
Triangles found: <0, 3, 4>
