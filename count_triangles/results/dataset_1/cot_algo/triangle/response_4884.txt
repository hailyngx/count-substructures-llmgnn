Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Reordering the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes:
0: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
7: 0 connections
10: 0 connections

Edges sorted by the lower degree node:
(1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (6, 8) (0, 8) (2, 1) (5, 1) (6, 2) (9, 2) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (5, 2) (2, 6) (9, 6) (8, 3) (2, 9)

Calculating the number of triangles:
- <1, 2, 5>
- []

Total number of triangles: [1]
