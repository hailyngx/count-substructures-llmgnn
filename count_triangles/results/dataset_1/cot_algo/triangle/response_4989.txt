Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method. First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then relabel the vertices accordingly.

Vertices by degree:
1. Vertex 1: 2 connections
2. Vertex 4: 2 connections
3. Vertex 7: 2 connections
4. Vertex 2: 1 connection
5. Vertex 9: 2 connections
6. Vertex 0: 2 connections
7. Vertex 5: 5 connections
8. Vertex 6: 3 connections
9. Vertex 8: 5 connections
10. Vertex 3: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
1. <1, 3, 5>
2. <3, 4, 5>
3. <3, 5, 6>
4. <3, 5, 8>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
