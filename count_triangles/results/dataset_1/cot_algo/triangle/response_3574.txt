Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 4 -> Degree 0
- Node 1 -> Degree 1
- Node 6 -> Degree 1
- Node 5 -> Degree 2
- Node 8 -> Degree 2
- Node 7 -> Degree 3
- Node 2 -> Degree 3
- Node 3 -> Degree 3
- Node 9 -> Degree 5
- Node 0 -> Degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, let's count the number of triangles and list them as <node1, node2, node3>:
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 5, 4>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <8, 7, 9>
- <2, 8, 7>
- <2, 8, 9>
- <2, 9, 1>
- <2, 9, 0>
- <9, 1, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
