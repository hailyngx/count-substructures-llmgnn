Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the nodes by their number of connections:

Nodes arranged by degree:
1. Node 5 (degree 1)
2. Node 7 (degree 1)
3. Node 8 (degree 1)
4. Node 3 (degree 2)
5. Node 5 (degree 2)
6. Node 7 (degree 2)
7. Node 8 (degree 2)
8. Node 4 (degree 3)
9. Node 6 (degree 3)
10. Node 9 (degree 4)
  
Now, we identify the triangles by examining the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <1, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
