Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 1

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the graph are as follows: 
- Triangle <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle <3, 5, 8>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>

The total number of triangles is [5].
