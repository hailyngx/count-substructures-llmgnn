Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are:  

Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 4: 1 connection  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 6: 5 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 9: 3 connections  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  

Using this method, we find the following triangles:  

- <0, 1, 6>  
- <0, 6, 7>  
- <0, 6, 8>  
- <1, 6, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
