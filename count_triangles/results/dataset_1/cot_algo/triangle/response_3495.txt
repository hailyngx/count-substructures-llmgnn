Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeled vertices:
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections

Now, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, and we will count the triangles formed by shared connections:

- Edge (0, 1): Forms a triangle with vertex 9 <0, 1, 9>
- Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle with vertices 6 and 9 <0, 3, 6> and <0, 3, 9>
- Edge (0, 9): Forms a triangle with vertices 1 and 3 <0, 9, 1> and <0, 9, 3>
- Edge (1, 6): Forms a triangle with vertex 9 <1, 6, 9>
- Edge (1, 8): Forms a triangle with vertex 9 <1, 8, 9>
- Edge (1, 9): Already counted
- Edge (2, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 9 <2, 4, 9>
- Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 9): Already counted
- Edge (5, 7): No triangle formed
- Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5], and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 9, 1>
<0, 9, 3>
