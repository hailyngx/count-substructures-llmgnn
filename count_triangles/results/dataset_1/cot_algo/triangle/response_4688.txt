Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 5 connections.
Node 3 has 6 connections.
Node 6 has 7 connections.
Node 5 has 8 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted nodes are:
2, 7, 1, 4, 0, 9, 8, 3, 6, 5

Now, we will count the triangles:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

There are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
