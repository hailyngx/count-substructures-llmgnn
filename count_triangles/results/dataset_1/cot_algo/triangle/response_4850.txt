Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. 
The vertices are sorted based on their degree:
Node 2 has degree 1
Nodes 1 and 8 have degree 2
Nodes 4, 5, and 6 have degree 4
Nodes 3, 7, and 9 have degree 5
Node 0 has degree 6

Now, relabeling the nodes accordingly:
Node 2 -> 0
Nodes 1 and 8 -> 1
Nodes 4, 5, and 6 -> 2, 3, 4 (in any order since they have the same degree)
Nodes 3, 7, and 9 -> 5, 6, 7 (in any order since they have the same degree)
Node 0 -> 8

Now, we can count the triangles by examining each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (1, 6): Shared connection with 4 forms a triangle <1, 4, 6>
- (2, 6): Forms a triangle with 4 and 6, so <2, 4, 6>
- (3, 5): Shared connection with 0 forms a triangle <0, 3, 5>
- (4, 8): Forms a triangle with 1 and 6, so <1, 4, 6>
- (6, 4): Triangle already counted, skipping
- (9, 8): Shared connection with 4 forms a triangle <4, 8, 9>

Count of triangles = 3

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
