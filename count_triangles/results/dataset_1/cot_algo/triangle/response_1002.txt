Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph based on the given edges:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Node 2 is connected to node 0.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

Now, let's sort the nodes by their degree:

Nodes by degree: [2, 7, 4, 6, 5, 0, 8, 1, 3, 9]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will re-label the nodes accordingly:

Node 2 → A (0-degree)
Node 7 → B (2-degree)
Node 4 → C (3-degree)
Node 6 → D (4-degree)
Node 5 → E (4-degree)
Node 0 → F (4-degree)
Node 8 → G (4-degree)
Node 1 → H (4-degree)
Node 3 → I (4-degree)
Node 9 → J (5-degree)

Next, we will check for triangles:
