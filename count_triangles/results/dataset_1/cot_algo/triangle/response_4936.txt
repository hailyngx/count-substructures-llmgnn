Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertex 1 (degree 2): 1
Vertex 0 (degree 3): 2
Vertex 5 (degree 3): 3
Vertex 3 (degree 3): 4
Vertex 4 (degree 3): 5
Vertex 2 (degree 3): 6
Vertex 6 (degree 5): 7
Vertex 9 (degree 5): 8

Now, let's analyze the edges based on the new labels:

(1, 2) cannot form a triangle.
(2, 1) cannot form a triangle.
(3, 5) cannot form a triangle.
(3, 6) cannot form a triangle.
(4, 0) cannot form a triangle.
(4, 6) can form a triangle: <2, 5, 7>.
(5, 3) cannot form a triangle.
(6, 0) cannot form a triangle.
(6, 3) can form a triangle: <5, 4, 7>. 
(6, 4) cannot form a triangle.
(6, 9) can form a triangle: <7, 5, 8>.
(9, 0) cannot form a triangle.
(9, 2) can form a triangle: <8, 6, 5>.
(9, 6) cannot form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <2, 5, 7>, <5, 4, 7>, and <7, 5, 8>.
