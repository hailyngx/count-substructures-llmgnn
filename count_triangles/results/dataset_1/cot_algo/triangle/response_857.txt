Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices sorted by their degrees: 5, 9, 0, 1, 5, 3, 6, 6, 2, 4

Now, let's relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 0 → 0 (degree: 5)
Vertex 1 → 1 (degree: 9)
Vertex 2 → 2 (degree: 0)
Vertex 3 → 3 (degree: 1)
Vertex 4 → 4 (degree: 5)
Vertex 5 → 5 (degree: 3)
Vertex 6 → 6 (degree: 4)
Vertex 7 → 7 (degree: 4)
Vertex 8 → 8 (degree: 3)
Vertex 9 → 9 (degree: 1)

Now, let's list the triangles by checking the shared connections between the two vertices of each edge:
Triangles: 
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 8, 6>
<3, 9, 6>
<4, 1, 8>
<6, 8, 7>
[5]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
