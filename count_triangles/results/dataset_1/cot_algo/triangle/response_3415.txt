Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
(0) - 1 connection
(1) - 2 connections
(4) - 2 connections
(5) - 2 connections
(2) - 2 connections
(9) - 3 connections
(8) - 3 connections
(3) - 4 connections
(7) - 4 connections
(6) - 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

Triangle 1: <1, 6, 3>
Triangle 2: <1, 7, 4>
Triangle 3: <1, 7, 0>
Triangle 4: <4, 6, 8>
Triangle 5: <4, 7, 0>
Triangle 6: <5, 6, 9>
Triangle 7: <5, 6, 1>
Triangle 8: <5, 9, 8>
Triangle 9: <2, 3, 6>
Triangle 10: <8, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
