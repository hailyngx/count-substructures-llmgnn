Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 5 → 0 connections
Nodes 2, 9 → 1 connection
Nodes 0, 1, 5 → 2 connections
Nodes 6, 9 → 3 connections
Nodes 4, 7 → 4 connections
Nodes 3, 8 → 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection at Node 1.
2. Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection at Node 2.
3. Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (3, 0), already counted.
7. Edge (3, 1) does not form a triangle.
8. Edge (4, 0), already counted.
9. Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
11. Edge (4, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection at Node 1.
12. Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
13. Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
14. Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle.
15. Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
16. Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
17. Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle.
18. Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle.
19. Edge (7, 6) does not form a triangle.
20. Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
21. Edge (8, 1) does not form a triangle.
22. Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.
23. Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle.
24. Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 1>, <0, 4, 1>
