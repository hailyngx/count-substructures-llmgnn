Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 3 -> 0 connections  
Node 5 -> 0 connections  
Node 0 -> 3 connections  
Node 9 -> 3 connections  
Node 4 -> 4 connections  
Node 6 -> 4 connections  
Node 2 -> 5 connections  
Node 1 -> 6 connections  
Node 7 -> 6 connections  
Node 8 -> 7 connections  

Now, let's go through each edge to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Nodes 0 and 1 both connect to node 8, forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.
2. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 and node 2 do not form a triangle.
3. Edge (0, 8): Nodes 0 and 8 form a triangle with node 1, <0, 1, 8>.
4. Edge (1, 0): Already considered in step 1.
5. Edge (1, 6): Node 1, node 6, and node 7 form a triangle <1, 6, 7>.
6. Edge (1, 7): Already considered in step 5.
7. Edge (1, 8): Already considered in step 1.
8. Edge (2, 0): Already considered in step 2.
9. Edge (2, 9): Node 2, node 9, and node 7 form a triangle <2, 9, 7>.
10. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 and node 4 do not form a triangle.
11. Edge (3, 7): Nodes 3, 7, and 4 form a triangle <3, 4, 7>.
12. Edge (4, 3): Already considered in step 11.
13. Edge (4, 8): Nodes 4, 8, and 7 form a triangle <4, 7, 8>.
14. Edge (5, 8): Node 5 does not form a triangle with node 8.
15. Edge (6, 1): Already considered in step 5.
16. Edge (6, 7): Already considered in step 5.
17. Edge (6, 8): Nodes 6, 8, and 7 form a triangle <6, 7, 8>.
18. Edge (7, 1): Already considered in step 5.
19. Edge (7, 3): Already considered in step 11.
20. Edge (7, 6): Already considered in step 5.
21. Edge (7, 8): Already considered in step 13.
22. Edge (7, 9): Node 7, 9, and 2 form a triangle <7, 9, 2>.
23. Edge (8, 0): Already considered in step 1.
24. Edge (8, 1): Already considered in step 1.
25. Edge (8, 4): Already considered in step 13.
26. Edge (8, 5): Node 8 does not form a triangle with node 5.
27. Edge (8, 6): Already considered in step 17.
28. Edge (8, 7): Already considered in step 13.
29. Edge (9, 2): Already considered in step 9.
30. Edge (9, 7): Already considered in step 22.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] with the unique triangles being <0, 1, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 9, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, and <6, 7, 8>.
