Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 1
Node 6: degree 1
Node 9: degree 2
Node 3: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 2: degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can find the triangles and count them. 

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 0, 2>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 0, 2>
<3, 0, 7>
<3, 0, 9>
<7, 2, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
