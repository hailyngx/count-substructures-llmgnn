Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

First, sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 0 (4 connections), 1 (4 connections), 6 (4 connections), 3 (4 connections), 4 (4 connections), 9 (3 connections), 7 (3 connections), 2 (2 connections), 5 (2 connections), 8 (2 connections)

Relabel the vertices:
0 -> 0 (4 connections)
1 -> 1 (4 connections)
6 -> 2 (4 connections)
3 -> 3 (4 connections)
4 -> 4 (4 connections)
9 -> 5 (3 connections)
7 -> 6 (3 connections)
2 -> 7 (2 connections)
5 -> 8 (2 connections)
8 -> 9 (2 connections)

Now, we go through the edges using the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
(0, 1): Shared connections with 2, 3 -> Triangle <0, 1, 2>
(0, 2): Shared connections with 1, 3 -> Triangle <0, 1, 2>
(0, 3): Shared connections with 1, 2 -> Triangle <0, 1, 3>
(0, 6): No triangle
(1, 3): Shared connections with 0, 2 -> Triangle <0, 1, 3>
(1, 6): No triangle
(1, 7): No triangle
(2, 3): Shared connections with 0, 1 -> Triangle <0, 2, 3>
(3, 4): No triangle
(4, 7): No triangle
(4, 8): No triangle
(5, 6): No triangle
(5, 9): No triangle
(6, 9): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>
