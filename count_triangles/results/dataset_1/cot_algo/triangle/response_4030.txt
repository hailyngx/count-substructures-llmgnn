Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each vertex based on the given edges:
Vertex 0: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 1
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 1
Vertex 4: degree 1
Vertex 5: degree 6
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 2

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
Vertex 1: degree 1
Vertex 3: degree 1
Vertex 4: degree 1
Vertex 0: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 5: degree 6

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (0, 5): Shared connections with 5 are 2 and 4. Triangle <0, 2, 4> is formed.
2. Edge (0, 6): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (3, 7): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (5, 0): Shared connections with 0 are 2 and 4. Triangle <0, 2, 4> (already counted) is formed.
8. Edge (5, 2): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (5, 4): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (5, 7): Shared connections with 7 are 0, 6, 8. Triangles <0, 5, 7> and <5, 6, 7> are formed.
11. Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (6, 0): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (7, 3): No triangles formed.
15. Edge (7, 5): Shared connections with 5 are 0, 6, 8. Triangle <0, 5, 7> (already counted) and <5, 6, 7> (already counted) are formed.
16. Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (8, 1): No triangles formed.
18. Edge (8, 5): No triangles formed.

Finally, we have found the following unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
