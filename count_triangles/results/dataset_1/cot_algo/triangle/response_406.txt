Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are: 
Node 6 (degree 1)  
Node 8 (degree 1)  
Nodes 1, 5, 9 (degree 2)  
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 (degree 4)  
Nodes 3 (degree 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the graph, we find:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4> (shared connection: 7)
- Triangle <2, 3, 7> (shared connection: 0)
- Triangle <1, 9, 5> (shared connection: none)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
