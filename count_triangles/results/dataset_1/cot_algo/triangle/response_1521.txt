Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Here is the sorted list of vertices and their connections:
(1) 7: 1 connection
(2) 1: 1 connection
(3) 0: 3 connections
(4) 6: 3 connections
(5) 5: 4 connections
(6) 2: 4 connections
(7) 8: 5 connections
(8) 3: 6 connections
(9) 9: 6 connections
(10) 4: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
1. (1, 4): This edge does not form any triangles.
2. (1, 6): This edge does not form any triangles.
3. (2, 4): This edge forms the triangle <2, 4, 9>.
4. (2, 5): This edge forms the triangle <2, 5, 6>.
5. (2, 6): This edge does not form any triangles.
6. (3, 4): This edge forms the triangle <3, 4, 8>.
7. (3, 5): This edge forms the triangle <2, 3, 5>.
8. (3, 7): This edge does not form any triangles.
9. (3, 8): This edge forms two triangles: <2, 3, 8> and <3, 4, 8>.
10. (3, 9): This edge forms two triangles: <2, 3, 9> and <3, 4, 9>.
11. (4, 1): This edge does not form any triangles.
12. (4, 2): This edge does not form any triangles.
13. (4, 3): This edge does not form any triangles.
14. (4, 7): This edge forms the triangle <3, 4, 7>.
15. (4, 8): This edge forms two triangles: <3, 4, 8> and <2, 4, 8>.
16. (4, 9): This edge forms two triangles: <2, 4, 9> and <3, 4, 9>.
17. (5, 0): This edge does not form any triangles.
18. (5, 2): This edge forms the triangle <2, 5, 6>.
19. (5, 3): This edge forms the triangle <2, 3, 5>.
20. (5, 8): This edge forms the triangle <2, 5, 8>.
21. (6, 0): This edge does not form any triangles.
22. (6, 1): This edge does not form any triangles.
23. (6, 2): This edge does not form any triangles.
24. (6, 8): This edge forms the triangle <2, 6, 8>.
25. (7, 3): This edge does not form any triangles.
26. (7, 4): This edge forms the triangle <3, 4, 7>.
27. (8, 3): This edge forms the triangle <2, 3, 8>.
28. (8, 4): This edge forms two triangles: <2, 4, 8> and <3, 4, 8>.
29. (8, 5): This edge forms the triangle <2, 5, 8>.
30. (8, 6): This edge forms the triangle <2, 6, 8>.
31. (8, 9): This edge forms two triangles: <2, 8, 9> and <3, 8, 9>.
32. (9, 0): This edge does not form any triangles.
33. (9, 2): This edge forms the triangle <2, 5, 9>.
34. (9, 3): This edge forms the triangle <2, 3, 9>.
35. (9, 4): This edge forms the triangle <2, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
