Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we get the following order: 
1, 7, 9, 6, 3, 5, 4, 8, 2

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For vertex 1: (1, 7) is the only edge involving 1, so no triangles are formed.

2. For vertex 7: (1, 7) and (7, 4) share vertex 4, forming a triangle <1, 7, 4>.

3. For vertex 9: (9, 6) is the only edge involving 9, so no triangles are formed.

4. For vertex 6: (9, 6) and (6, 2) share vertex 9, forming a triangle <9, 6, 2>.

5. For vertex 3: (3, 2) and (3, 8) share vertex 2, forming a triangle <3, 2, 8>.

6. For vertex 5: (5, 2) and (5, 8) share vertex 2, forming a triangle <5, 2, 8>.

7. For vertex 4: (7, 4) and (4, 2) share vertex 7, forming a triangle <7, 4, 2>.

8. For vertex 8: (3, 8), (5, 8), and (8, 9) share vertex 8, forming triangles <3, 8, 5> and <8, 5, 9>.

9. For vertex 2: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 2), (5, 2), and (6, 2) share vertex 2, forming triangles <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, and <2, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is 12, and the unique triangles found are:
<1, 7, 4>, <9, 6, 2>, <3, 2, 8>, <5, 2, 8>, <7, 4, 2>, <3, 8, 5>, <8, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 9>. [12]
