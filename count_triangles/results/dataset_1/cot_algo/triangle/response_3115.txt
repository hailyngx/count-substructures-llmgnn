Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 5 is connected to 0 nodes.
Vertices 0 and 10 are connected to 1 node.
Vertices 1, 2, 4, and 6 are connected to 2 nodes.
Vertices 3, 8, and 9 are connected to 3 nodes.
Vertex 7 is connected to 4 nodes.

Now, we relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 5 → 0
Vertices 0 and 10 → 1
Vertices 1, 2, 4, and 6 → 2
Vertices 3, 8, and 9 → 3
Vertex 7 → 4

Next, we review each edge to count the number of triangles formed:

(1, 7):
    - Check if vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 7: Yes
    - Shared connections with vertices: None
(2, 7):
    - Check if vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 7: Yes
    - Shared connections with vertices: None
(3, 4):
    - Check if vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 4: No
(3, 8):
    - Check if vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 8: Yes
    - Shared connection with vertex 7
(3, 9):
    - Check if vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 9: Yes
    - Shared connection with vertex 6
(4, 3):
    - Check if vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 3: Yes
    - Shared connection with vertex 9
(6, 9):
    - Check if vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 9: Yes
    - Shared connection with vertex 3
(7, 1):
    - Check if vertex 7 has fewer connections than vertex 1: No
(7, 2):
    - Check if vertex 7 has fewer connections than vertex 2: No
(7, 8):
    - Check if vertex 7 has fewer connections than vertex 8: Yes
    - Shared connection with vertex 3
(8, 3):
    - Check if vertex 8 has fewer connections than vertex 3: Yes
    - Shared connection with vertex 9
(8, 7):
    - Check if vertex 8 has fewer connections than vertex 7: No
(9, 3):
    - Check if vertex 9 has fewer connections than vertex 3: Yes
    - Shared connection with vertex 4
(9, 6):
    - Check if vertex 9 has fewer connections than vertex 6: No
