Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 3: 0 connections
Vertex 8: 0 connections
Vertices 7, 2: 1 connection
Vertices 0, 1: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertices 4, 6: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Based on this, the triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
