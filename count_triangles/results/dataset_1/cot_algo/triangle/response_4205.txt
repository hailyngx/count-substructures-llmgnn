Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):

Vertices: 0(2), 1(2), 2(2), 3(3), 4(2), 6(3), 7(2), 8(1), 9(4)

Re-labeling the vertices accordingly: 

Vertices: 8(1), 2(2), 4(3), 0(4), 1(5), 6(6), 7(7), 3(8), 9(9)

Now, let's count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 and 7 have no common neighbors.
- Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 and 8 have no common neighbors.
- Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 and 4 have no common neighbors.
- Edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 and 6 have no common neighbors. 
- Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 and 9 have a common neighbor 6. Triangle found: <3, 6, 9>.
- Edge (4, 2): Vertex 4 and 2 have no common neighbors.
- Edge (6, 3): Skip since vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 6.
- Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 and 9 have a common neighbor 3. Triangle found: <3, 6, 9>.
- Edge (7, 0): Vertex 0 and 7 have no common neighbors.
- Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 and 9 have no common neighbors.
- Edge (8, 1): Vertex 1 and 8 have no common neighbors.
- Edge (9, 3): Skip since vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 9.
- Edge (9, 6): Skip since vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 9.
- Edge (9, 7): Vertex 9 and 7 have no common neighbors.

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles: <3, 6, 9>
