Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
By arranging the nodes in order of degree, we have: 

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 4: 0 connections
Nodes 0 and 4: 1 connection
Nodes 7 and 8: 3 connections
Nodes 1, 5, and 6: 4 connections
Nodes 2 and 3: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections

Based on the given edges and the degree-based ordering, we can count the triangles. 

Triangles in the graph:
[12]

Unique triangles:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
