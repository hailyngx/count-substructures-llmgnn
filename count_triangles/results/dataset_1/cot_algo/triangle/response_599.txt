Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on the number of connections:

Nodes sorted by degree:
1. Node 9: Degree 1
2. Node 1: Degree 1
3. Node 7: Degree 2
4. Node 0: Degree 3
5. Node 3: Degree 2
6. Node 4: Degree 3
7. Node 2: Degree 2
8. Node 8: Degree 4
9. Node 5: Degree 6

Calculating the number of triangles:

Total Triangles: 6
List of triangles: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 7> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
