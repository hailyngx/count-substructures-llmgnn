Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0 - 1 connection
Node 7 - 1 connection
Node 8 - 1 connection
Node 4 - 1 connection
Node 5 - 1 connection
Node 2 - 2 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 9 - 5 connections
Node 3 - 5 connections
Node 6 - 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check for triangles:
- Edge (0, 6): Nodes 0 and 6 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Edge (1, 2): Nodes 1 and 2 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Edge (1, 4): Nodes 1 and 4 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Edge (1, 5): Nodes 1 and 5 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Edge (1, 6): Node 1 has more connections than Node 6, so we move on.
- Edge (2, 1): Nodes 2 and 1 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Edge (2, 3): Nodes 2, 3, and 7 form a triangle <2, 3, 7>.
- Edge (3, 2): We skip this edge since it was already counted.
- Edge (3, 7): This edge was already counted in the triangle found earlier.
- Edge (3, 9): Nodes 3, 9, and 6 form a triangle <3, 9, 6>.
- Edge (4, 1): Nodes 4 and 1 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Edge (5, 1): Nodes 5 and 1 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Edge (6, 0): Nodes 0 and 6 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Edge (6, 1): Node 6 has more connections than Node 1, so we move on.
- Edge (6, 9): Nodes 6 and 9 do not form a triangle with any other node.
- Edge (7, 3): This edge was already counted in the triangle found earlier.
- Edge (8, 9): Nodes 8, 9, and 6 form a triangle <8, 9, 6>.
- Edge (9, 3): This edge was already counted in the triangle found earlier.
- Edge (9, 6): This edge was already counted in the triangle found earlier.
- Edge (9, 8): This edge was already counted in the triangle found earlier.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 2, and the unique triangles are <2, 3, 7> and <8, 9, 6>. 

Output: [2]
