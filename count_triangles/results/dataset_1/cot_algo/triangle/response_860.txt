Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By arranging the vertices in order of their degree, we get the following list from least to most connections:

Node 0 : 1 connection
Node 5 : 2 connections
Node 7 : 2 connections
Node 4 : 3 connections
Node 2 : 4 connections
Node 8 : 4 connections
Node 6 : 4 connections
Node 9 : 5 connections
Node 1 : 6 connections
Node 3 : 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge to count the number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [13]

Unique triangles found:
