Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections from least to most, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 1: degree 6
Node 6: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can find the triangles:

- Triangle <1, 2, 6> (connections: 1-2, 2-6, 1-6)
- Triangle <1, 4, 6> (connections: 1-6, 1-4, 4-6)
- Triangle <1, 6, 9> (connections: 1-6, 1-9, 6-9)
- Triangle <2, 3, 6> (connections: 2-3, 2-6, 3-6)
- Triangle <4, 6, 8> (connections: 4-6, 4-8, 6-8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
