Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0: 5 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 3: 5 connections
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 1 connection
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 3 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices should be relabeled as follows:
- Vertex 2: 0 connections
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 3 connections
- Vertex 0: 5 connections
- Vertex 3: 5 connections

Next, we will consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (2, 6): Forms a triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (4, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <0, 4, 3>
- Edge (5, 0): Forms a triangle with vertex 6. Triangle: <5, 0, 6>
- Edge (8, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <0, 8, 3>
- Edge (1, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <1, 3, 0>
- Edge (6, 0): Forms a triangle with vertex 2. Triangle: <6, 0, 2>
- Edge (7, 0): Forms a triangle with vertex 9. Triangle: <7, 0, 9>
- Edge (7, 9): Forms a triangle with vertex 0. Triangle: <7, 9, 0>

The total number of triangles is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 3>, <5, 0, 6>, <0, 8, 3>, <1, 3, 0>, <6, 0, 2>, <7, 0, 9>.
