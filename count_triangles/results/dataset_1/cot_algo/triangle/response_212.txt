Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 1
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 7
Node 2 has degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Checking edge (0, 1) but the condition is not satisfied.
Checking edge (0, 2) gives a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
Checking edge (0, 7) gives a triangle <0, 7, 6>.
Checking edge (0, 9) gives a triangle <0, 9, 5>.

Checking edge (1, 5) gives a triangle <1, 5, 9>.
Checking edge (1, 6) gives a triangle <1, 6, 7>.

Checking edge (2, 4) but the condition is not satisfied.
Checking edge (2, 7) but the condition is not satisfied.
Checking edge (2, 9) gives a triangle <2, 9, 5>.

Checking edge (3, 4) but the condition is not satisfied.

Checking edge (5, 9) but the condition is not satisfied.

Checking edge (6, 7) gives a triangle <6, 7, 9>.
Checking edge (6, 9) gives a triangle <6, 9, 7>.

Checking edge (7, 9) gives a triangle <7, 9, 0>.

After going through all edges, the total number of triangles is [8].
