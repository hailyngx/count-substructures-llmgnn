Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following labeling:
- Node 2 (degree 2)
- Node 7 (degree 3)
- Node 5 (degree 3)
- Node 9 (degree 2)
- Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 3 (degree 3)
- Node 6 (degree 3)
- Node 8 (degree 3)
- Node 0 (degree 7)
- Node 4 (degree 4)

To count the triangles by examining each edge, we consider the pairs:
(0, 1): forms triangles with (0, 4) and (1, 5)
(0, 3): form a triangle with (3, 4)
(0, 4): form a triangle with (4, 6) and (4, 3)
(0, 6): form a triangle with (6, 4)
(0, 8): no triangles
(0, 9): no triangles
(1, 5): form a triangle with (5, 7)
(1, 9): no triangles
(2, 7): no triangles
(2, 8): no triangles
(3, 4): no triangles
(4, 6): form a triangle with (6, 7)
(5, 7): no triangles
(5, 8): no triangles
(6, 7): no triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, and <0, 4, 3>.
