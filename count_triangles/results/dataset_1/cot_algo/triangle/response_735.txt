Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 5 has degree 2
Nodes 1, 3, 7 have degree 3
Nodes 6, 9 have degree 4
Nodes 2, 4, 8 have degree 5
Node 0 has degree 6

Now, we proceed by checking edges where the vertex with lower label has fewer connections:

Checking edge (0, 2): Nodes 0 and 2 share 3 connections with nodes 4, 8, and 9 forming a triangle. Triangle <0, 2, 4> is found.
Checking edge (0, 4): Nodes 0 and 4 share 3 connections with nodes 2, 5, and 8 forming a triangle. Triangle <0, 4, 2> is found.
Checking edge (0, 5): Node 0 and node 5 do not form a triangle.
Checking edge (0, 8): Nodes 0 and 8 share 3 connections with nodes 2, 4, and 9 forming a triangle. Triangle <0, 8, 2> is found.
Checking edge (0, 9): Nodes 0 and 9 share 3 connections with nodes 2, 4, and 8 forming a triangle. Triangle <0, 9, 2> is found.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>
