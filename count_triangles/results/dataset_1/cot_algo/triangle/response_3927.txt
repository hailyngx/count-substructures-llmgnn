Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is:
Nodes: 2, 9 <br>
Nodes: 0, 2, 4, 8 <br>
Nodes: 1, 5 <br>
Nodes: 7 <br>
Nodes: 3 <br>
Nodes: 6

In this case, as we only have to consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, the edges that qualify are:
(1, 5), (2, 9), (0, 2)

Analyzing these edges for shared connections:
(1, 5) shares connection with: 6 (form a triangle 1-5-6)
(2, 9) shares connection with: None
(0, 2) shares connection with: 6 (form a triangle 0-2-6)

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2.
The unique triangles found are: <1, 5, 6>, <0, 2, 6>. 

Therefore, the output is [2].
