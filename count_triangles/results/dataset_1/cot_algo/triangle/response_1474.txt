Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling will be as follows:
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 1): Forms triangle with Node 3 <0, 1, 3>
- Edge (0, 3): Forms triangle with Node 1 <0, 3, 1>
- Edge (0, 4): No triangles formed
- Edge (0, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 7): Forms triangle with Node 1 <3, 7, 1>
- Edge (3, 8): Forms triangle with Node 0 <3, 8, 0>
- Edge (5, 8): Forms triangle with Node 0 <5, 8, 0>
- Edge (5, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <3, 7, 1>, and <5, 8, 0>.
