Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their degree:
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Nodes 0, 8: 2 connections
Nodes 3, 5, 7, 9: 3 connections
Nodes 2, 4: 4 connections

Triangles found:
<5, 4, 7>
<5, 3, 9>
<5, 2, 1>
<8, 0, 4>
