Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the instructions for the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort the vertices by their degree:
- Node 3: degree 0
- Node 5: degree 0
- Nodes 0, 1, 4, 6: degree 3
- Nodes 8, 9: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 1

2. Relabel the vertices according to their degrees:
- Node 3: 1
- Node 5: 2
- Nodes 0, 1, 4, 6: 3
- Nodes 8, 9: 4
- Node 2: 5
- Node 7: 6

3. Check each edge starting from vertices with lower labels and count triangles:
- Edge (0, 1): Check shared connections -> Node 2 forms a triangle <0, 1, 2>
- Edge (0, 2): Check shared connections -> No triangles formed
- Edge (0, 8): Check shared connections -> No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 2): Check shared connections -> No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 8): Check shared connections -> No triangles formed
- Edge (4, 2): Check shared connections -> No triangles formed
- Edge (6, 2): Check shared connections -> No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 9): Check shared connections -> No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 9): Check shared connections -> No triangles formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 1, 2>.
