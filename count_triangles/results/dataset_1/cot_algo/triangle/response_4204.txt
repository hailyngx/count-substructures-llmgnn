Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly:

Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 1 connection.
Nodes 5 and 9 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 0, 1, 7 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 4 and 8 have 4 connections each.
Node 6 has 5 connections.

Reordering the nodes from least to most connections gives us: 3, 5, 9, 2, 1, 7, 0, 8, 4, 6.

Now, we will check each edge based on the ordering to count the triangles:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<8, 6, 4>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
