Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling:

0 (degree 4) <br>
1 (degree 1) <br>
5 (degree 2) <br>
4 (degree 2) <br>
6 (degree 3) <br>
3 (degree 4) <br>
7 (degree 4) <br>
8 (degree 4) <br>
9 (degree 4) <br>
2 (degree 5) <br>

Using this ordering, we will count the triangles:
1. (0, 3) shares 1 connection: Triangle <0, 3, 2>
2. (0, 4) shares 1 connection: Triangle <0, 4, 6>
3. (0, 5) shares 1 connection: Triangle <0, 5, 2>
4. (0, 6) shares 1 connection: Triangle <0, 6, 4>
5. (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
6. (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
7. (2, 5) shares 1 connection: Triangle <2, 5, 0>
8. (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
9. (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
10. (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
11. (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
12. (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
13. (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
14. (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
15. (8, 9) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles found: <0, 3, 2>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 6, 4>
