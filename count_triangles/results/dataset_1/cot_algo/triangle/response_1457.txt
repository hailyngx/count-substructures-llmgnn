Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 4 has 2 connections.
Vertex 1 has 2 connections.
Vertex 2 has 2 connections.
Vertex 9 has 2 connections.
Vertex 5 has 3 connections.
Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
Vertex 8 has 4 connections.
Vertex 7 has 4 connections.
Vertex 3 has 6 connections.
Vertex 0 has 5 connections.
