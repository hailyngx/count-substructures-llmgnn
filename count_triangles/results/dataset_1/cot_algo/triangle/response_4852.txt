Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's label the nodes based on their degree from least to most connected:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 6: 7 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 8 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:
- For edge (0, 3): No triangle formed since node 0 and node 3 both have 3 connections.
- For edge (0, 4): No triangle formed since node 0 and node 4 both have 3 connections.
- For edge (0, 7): Triangle formed with node 6 as <0, 6, 7>.
- For edge (1, 8): No triangle formed since node 1 has only 1 connection.
- For edge (2, 6): No triangle formed since node 2 and node 6 both have more connections than node 6.
- For edge (2, 8): No triangle formed since node 2 has more connections than node 8.
- For edge (3, 6): No triangle formed since node 3 and node 6 both have more connections than node 3.
- For edge (3, 8): Triangle formed with node 2 as <3, 6, 8>.
- For edge (4, 6): Triangle formed with node 8 as <4, 6, 8>.
- For edge (4, 8): Triangle formed with node 3 as <4, 6, 8>.
- For edge (6, 2): Triangle formed with node 3 as <2, 3, 6>.
- For edge (6, 3): Triangle formed with node 4 as <3, 4, 6>.
- For edge (6, 4): No triangle formed since node 6 has more connections than node 4.
- For edge (6, 7): No triangle formed since node 6 has more connections than node 7.
- For edge (6, 8): Triangle formed with node 0 as <6, 7, 8>.
- For edge (6, 9): No triangle formed since node 6 has more connections than node 9.
- For edge (7, 0): No triangle formed since node 0 has more connections than node 7.
- For edge (7, 6): No triangle formed since node 6 has more connections than node 7.
- For edge (7, 8): Triangle formed with node 6 as <7, 8, 9>.
- For edge (8, 1): No triangle formed since node 1 has only 1 connection.
- For edge (8, 2): No triangle formed since node 2 has more connections than node 8.
- For edge (8, 3): No triangle formed since node 3 has more connections than node 8.
- For edge (8, 4): No triangle formed since node 4 has more connections than node 8.
- For edge (8, 6): No triangle formed since node 6 has more connections than node 8.
- For edge (8, 7): Triangle formed with node 0 as <7, 8, 0>.
- For edge (8, 9): Triangle formed with node 6 as <8, 7, 9>.
- For edge (9, 6): No triangle formed since node 6 has more connections than node 9.
- For edge (9, 8): Triangle formed with node 6 as <8, 9, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <7, 8, 9>.
