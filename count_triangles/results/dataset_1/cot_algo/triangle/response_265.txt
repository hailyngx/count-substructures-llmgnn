Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following order: 

Node 2: Degree 2  
Node 6: Degree 2  
Node 4: Degree 2  
Node 0: Degree 2  
Node 9: Degree 2  
Node 5: Degree 3  
Node 3: Degree 3  
Node 8: Degree 4  
Node 7: Degree 5  
Node 1: Degree 7  

Now, we will examine each edge based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections. 

Starting with the process of counting triangles:  

For edge (0, 5):  
- Shared connection with 1  
- Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>

For edge (0, 8): No triangle  

For edge (1, 2): No triangle  

For edge (1, 4): No triangle  

For edge (1, 5): No triangle  

For edge (1, 6): No triangle  

For edge (1, 7):  
- Shared connection with 2 and 3  
- Triangles formed: <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 7>

For edge (1, 8):  
- Shared connection with 0  
- Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>

For edge (2, 1): No triangle  

For edge (2, 7): No triangle  

For edge (2, 9): No triangle  

For edge (3, 5):  
- Shared connection with 1 and 7  
- Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 7>

For edge (3, 7): No triangle  

For edge (3, 9): No triangle  

For edge (4, 1): No triangle  

For edge (4, 8): No triangle  

For edge (5, 0): No triangle  

For edge (5, 1): No triangle  

For edge (5, 3): No triangle  

For edge (6, 1): No triangle  

For edge (7, 1): No triangle  

For edge (7, 2): No triangle  

For edge (7, 3): No triangle  

For edge (7, 8):  
- Shared connection with 0 and 1  
- Triangle formed: <0, 1, 7>

For edge (8, 0): No triangle  

For edge (8, 1): No triangle  

For edge (8, 4): No triangle  

For edge (9, 2): No triangle  

For edge (9, 3): No triangle  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6], and the unique triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 5>  
<0, 1, 8>  
<1, 2, 7>  
<1, 3, 7>  
<1, 3, 5>  
<0, 1, 7>
