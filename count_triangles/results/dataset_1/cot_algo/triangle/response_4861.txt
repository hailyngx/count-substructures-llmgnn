Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new ordering is: 1, 6, 9, 7, 5, 4, 2, 3, 8.

Using this ordering, we can count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge.

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 7>
