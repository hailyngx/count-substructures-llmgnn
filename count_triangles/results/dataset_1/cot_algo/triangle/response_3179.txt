Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degree:
Node 3 has degree 2
Nodes 7 and 8 have degree 3
Nodes 5 and 6 have degree 4
Nodes 4 and 9 have degree 5
Nodes 1 and 2 have degree 6
Node 0 has degree 7

Re-labeling the vertices:
Node 3 -> A
Node 7 -> B
Node 8 -> C
Node 5 -> D
Node 6 -> E
Node 4 -> F
Node 9 -> G
Node 1 -> H
Node 2 -> I
Node 0 -> J

Edges with the lower labeled vertices having fewer connections:
(A, F) forms triangle <A, F, G>.
(A, E) forms triangle <A, E, G>.
(F, C) forms triangle <F, C, I>.
(F, D) forms triangle <F, D, G>.
(B, C) forms no triangle.
(B, D) forms no triangle.
(C, D) forms no triangle.
(D, F) forms triangle <D, F, G>.
(D, I) forms triangle <D, I, H>.
(E, H) forms triangle <E, H, G>.
(E, G) forms triangle <E, G, H>.
(H, G) forms triangle <H, G, J>.
(I, H) forms triangle <I, H, J>.
(I, J) forms triangle <I, J, G>.

Total number of triangles: [12]
