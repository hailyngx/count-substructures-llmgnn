Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. After relabeling the vertices accordingly, the graph becomes:

Vertices: (0, 3 connections) (1, 5 connections) (2, 2 connections) (3, 2 connections) (4, 4 connections) (6, 1 connection) (7, 4 connections) (8, 3 connections) (9, 2 connections)

Based on the connections, the edges to be considered are: 

(0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (7, 9)

Now, counting the triangles with the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (0, 2): Forms a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
2. (0, 4): No triangles formed.
3. (1, 2): No triangles formed.
4. (1, 4): No triangles formed.
5. (1, 6): No triangles formed.
6. (1, 7): Forms a triangle <1, 7, 4>.
7. (1, 8): Forms a triangle <1, 8, 4>.
8. (3, 8): No triangles formed.
9. (3, 9): No triangles formed.
10. (4, 8): Forms a triangle <4, 8, 1>.
11. (7, 9): Forms a triangle <7, 9, 3>.

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph: <0, 2, 4>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 8, 4>, <7, 9, 3>.
