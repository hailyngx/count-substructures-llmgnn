Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 1, 4, 8, 5, 2, 8, 0, 9, 3, 6

Now, we need to relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 1 - Vertex 0 (1 connection)
Vertex 4 - Vertex 1 (2 connections)
Vertex 8 - Vertex 2 (2 connections)
Vertex 5 - Vertex 3 (2 connections)
Vertex 2 - Vertex 4 (2 connections)
Vertex 8 - Vertex 5 (3 connections)
Vertex 0 - Vertex 6 (3 connections)
Vertex 9 - Vertex 7 (4 connections)
Vertex 3 - Vertex 8 (5 connections)
Vertex 6 - Vertex 9 (6 connections)

We can now analyze the edges starting from the edges with the vertex with the lower label.

Examining the edges: (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 9), (5, 6), (6, 9), (7, 8)

Triangles found: <0, 7, 3>, <0, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
