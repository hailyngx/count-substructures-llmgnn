Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree (number of connections) are: 
(5) - 0, 5, 7
(4) - 2, 4
(5) - 1
(6) - 3, 6, 9, 8

I will start counting the triangles by examining each edge: 
1. Edge (0, 3): Shared connections are 2, 8. Triangle <0, 2, 3> found.
2. Edge (0, 4): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (0, 8): Shared connections are 1, 3, 9. Triangles <0, 1, 8> and <0, 3, 8> found.
4. Edge (0, 9): Shared connections are 6, 8. Triangle <0, 6, 9> found.
5. Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (1, 8): Shared connections are 0, 3, 9. Triangle <1, 0, 8> found.
8. Edge (1, 9): Shared connections are 0, 6, 8. Triangle <1, 0, 9> found.
9. Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (2, 8): Shared connection is 1. No triangle formed.
11. Edge (3, 0): Shared connections are 2, 8. Triangle <3, 0, 2> found.
12. Edge (3, 2): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (3, 4): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (3, 8): Shared connections are 0, 1, 9. Triangle <3, 0, 8> found.
15. Edge (4, 0): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (4, 3): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (6, 5): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (6, 8): Shared connection is 0. No triangle formed.
20. Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.
21. Edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
22. Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed.
23. Edge (8, 0): Shared connections are 1, 3, 9. Triangles <8, 1, 0> and <8, 3, 0> found.
24. Edge (8, 1): Shared connections are 0, 3, 9. Triangle <8, 0, 1> found.
25. Edge (8, 2): No triangle formed.
26. Edge (8, 3): Shared connections are 0, 1, 9. Triangle <8, 0, 3> found.
27. Edge (8, 6): No triangle formed.
28. Edge (8, 7): No triangle formed.
29. Edge (8, 9): No triangle formed.
30. Edge (9, 0): Shared connections are 6, 8. Triangle <9, 0, 6> found.
31. Edge (9, 1): Shared connections are 0, 6, 8. Triangle <9, 0, 1> found.
32. Edge (9, 6): No triangle formed.
33. Edge (9, 8): No triangle formed.

After examining all edges, the total number of triangles found is 11, and the unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 0, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <3, 0, 8>, <8, 1, 0>, <8, 0, 3>, <9, 0, 6>, <9, 0, 1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
