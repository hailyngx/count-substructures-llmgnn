Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 4

Arranging the nodes in ascending order of degree: 4, 8, 1, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3.

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
1. (1, 2): Node 1 and Node 2 have a shared connection with Node 5 forming a triangle <1, 2, 5>.
2. (1, 8): No triangles formed.
3. (2, 5): Node 2 and Node 5 have a shared connection with Node 3 forming a triangle <2, 5, 3>.
4. (3, 4): No triangles formed.
5. (3, 5): Node 3 and Node 5 have a shared connection with Node 9 forming a triangle <3, 5, 9>.
6. (3, 7): No triangles formed.
7. (3, 9): Node 3 and Node 9 have a shared connection with Node 5 forming a triangle <3, 9, 5>.
8. (5, 9): No additional triangles formed.
9. (7, 9): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are: <1, 2, 5>, <2, 5, 3>, <3, 5, 9>.
