Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the new vertex labels are as follows: 
Nodes: 6, 9, 1, 5, 4, 2, 8, 3, 0, 7

Analyzing the edges with the aforementioned condition:

Edge (0, 6): Both vertices have less connections than vertex 6.
Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has more connections.
Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has more connections.
Edge (1, 2): Both vertices have less connections than vertex 1.
Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 has more connections.
Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has more connections.
Edge (2, 1): Vertex 1 has more connections.
Edge (2, 3): Both vertices have less connections than vertex 2.
Edge (2, 5): Vertex 2 has more connections.
Edge (2, 8): Vertex 2 has more connections.
Edge (3, 1): Vertex 1 has more connections.
Edge (3, 2): Vertex 2 has more connections.
Edge (3, 4): Both vertices have less connections than vertex 3.
Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 has more connections.
Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 has more connections.
Edge (4, 3): Vertex 3 has more connections.
Edge (5, 2): Vertex 2 has more connections.
Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5 has more connections.
Edge (6, 0): Both vertices have less connections than vertex 6.
Edge (8, 0): Vertex 0 has more connections.
Edge (8, 1): Vertex 1 has more connections.
Edge (8, 2): Vertex 2 has more connections.
Edge (8, 3): Vertex 3 has more connections.
Edge (8, 5): Vertex 5 has more connections.
Edge (9, 0): Vertex 0 has more connections.
Edge (9, 3): Vertex 3 has more connections.
