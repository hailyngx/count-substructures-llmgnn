Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices with their connections:
0: 6 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 5 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 6 connections

Based on the sorting, the new labeling for the vertices will be:
2, 3, 8, 1, 7, 6, 4, 5, 0, 9

Now, we will count the triangles by following the method described earlier:

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <0, 6, 7>
6. <1, 4, 7>
7. <1, 9, 0>
8. <4, 6, 7>
9. <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
