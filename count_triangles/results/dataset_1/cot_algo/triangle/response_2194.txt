Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows: 
Vertices: 4, 5
Vertices: 1, 4, 5, 6
Vertices: 3, 7
Vertices: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
Vertices: 2, 3, 8
Vertices: 6, 7, 9
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
Vertices: 3, 6, 7, 8
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Vertices: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8

Now, we will count the triangles based on the given edges:
Triangles: 
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles is [6].
