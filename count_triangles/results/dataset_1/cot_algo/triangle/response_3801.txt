Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree:
Node 0: degree 1
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 1
Node 4: degree 2
Node 7: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 0 -> Node 1
Node 9 -> Node 2
Node 4 -> Node 3
Node 5 -> Node 4
Node 7 -> Node 5
Node 3 -> Node 6
Node 6 -> Node 7

Now, we will consider each edge, following the rule that the lower labeled vertex should have fewer connections. We find the following triangles: 
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
