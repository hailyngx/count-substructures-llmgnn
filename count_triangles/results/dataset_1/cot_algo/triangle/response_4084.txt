Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

0 (degree 5) -> 2 (degree 4) -> 1 (degree 4) -> 7 (degree 4) -> 3 (degree 4) -> 9 (degree 4) -> 8 (degree 3) -> 4 (degree 4) -> 6 (degree 3) -> 5 (degree 4)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph: 

[15]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<7, 8, 9>
