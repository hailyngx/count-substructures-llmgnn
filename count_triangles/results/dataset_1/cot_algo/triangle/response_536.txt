Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the nodes by their degree:
Nodes: 0 1 2 4 5 6
Degrees: 2 2 4 4 4 1

The degree-based ordering is: 0 1 6 2 4 5

Now, let's list the edges according to the sorted order:
(0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2)

Now we check for triangles:
- Triangle <2, 4, 5>
