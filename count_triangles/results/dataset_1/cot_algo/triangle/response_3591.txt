Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices in order of connections: 1, 7, 8, 6, 1, 3, 5, 4, 0, 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly as follows:
1 -> 0
7 -> 1
8 -> 2
6 -> 3
1 -> 4
3 -> 5
5 -> 6
4 -> 7
0 -> 8
2 -> 9

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge (0, 2): Vertex 0 has connections with 4 and 5. Vertex 2 has connections with 3 and 4. The shared connection is 4. Triangle <0, 2, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 has connections with 2, 5, and 7. Vertex 4 has connections with 2, 3, and 6. The shared connections are 2 and 6. Triangles <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 6>.
3. Edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 has connections with 2, 4, and 3. Vertex 5 has connections with 3 and 4. The shared connection is 3. Triangle <0, 5, 3>.
4. Edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 has a connection with 4. Vertex 7 has a connection with 9. There are no shared connections; no triangles.
5. Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has connections with 2 and 4. Vertex 8 has a connection with 6. There are no shared connections; no triangles.
6. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has connections with 2, 4, and 7. Vertex 9 has connections with 1, 2, and 7. The shared connections are 2 and 7. Triangle <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 7>.
7. Edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 has a connection with 9. Vertex 9 has connections with 0, 2, and 7. The shared connection is 9. Triangle <1, 9, 0>.
8. Edge (2, 0): Already counted.
9. Edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 has connections with 0, 4, and 9. Vertex 3 has connections with 5 and 6. There are no shared connections; no triangles.
10. Edge (2, 4): Already counted.
11. Edge (2, 9): Already counted.
12. Edge (3, 2): Already counted.
13. Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 has connections with 2, 4, and 6. Vertex 5 has connections with 0, 4, and 6. The shared connection is 6. Triangle <3, 5, 6>.
14. Edge (3, 6): Already counted.
15. Edge (4, 0): Already counted.
16. Edge (4, 2): Already counted.
17. Edge (4, 5): Already counted.
18. Edge (4, 6): Already counted.
19. Edge (5, 0): Already counted.
20. Edge (5, 3): Already counted.
21. Edge (5, 4): Already counted.
22. Edge (6, 3): Already counted.
23. Edge (6, 4): Already counted.
24. Edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 has a connection with 4. Vertex 8 has a connection with 0. There are no shared connections; no triangles.
25. Edge (7, 0): Already counted.
26. Edge (7, 9): Already counted.
27. Edge (8, 0): Already counted.
28. Edge (8, 6): Already counted.
29. Edge (9, 0): Already counted.
30. Edge (9, 1): Already counted.
31. Edge (9, 2): Already counted.
32. Edge (9, 7): Already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 9, 2>, and <0, 9, 7>.
