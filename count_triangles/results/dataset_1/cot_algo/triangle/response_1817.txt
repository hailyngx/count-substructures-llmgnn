Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires first sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly.

The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:
0: 1 connection
1: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
3: 5 connections
4: 6 connections
2: 7 connections

Now we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

For edge (0, 8):
    - Both 0 and 8 have 1 connection each, so we proceed.
    - No triangle is formed as they do not have any shared connections.

For edge (1, 3):
    - 1 has 3 connections and 3 has 5 connections, so we proceed.
    - Shared connections: 4
    - Triangle: <1, 3, 4>

(Repeating the same process for remaining edges)

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is: [1]
The unique triangles found are: <1, 3, 4>
