Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Degrees: 2, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2, 2, 4

Now, we relabel the vertices:
Vertex: 1, 7, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 6, 9

Next, we check each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
(0, 5): shared connections with 3, 4
(0, 6): no triangle
(2, 9): no triangle
(3, 4): shared connection with 5
(3, 5): shared connection with 0
(4, 5): shared connections with 0, 3
(4, 9): shared connections with 2, 6
(5, 7): no triangle
(7, 8): no triangle
(8, 7): no triangle
(9, 6): no triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 9>.
