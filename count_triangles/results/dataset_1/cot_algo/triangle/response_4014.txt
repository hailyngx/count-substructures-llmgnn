Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Vertex 9 -> 1 connection  
Vertex 1 -> 2 connections  
Vertex 4 -> 2 connections  
Vertex 8 -> 2 connections  
Vertex 3 -> 2 connections  
Vertex 5 -> 3 connections  
Vertex 6 -> 4 connections  
Vertex 2 -> 5 connections  
Vertex 7 -> 6 connections  
Vertex 0 -> 7 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph:

Checking edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 (7 connections), Vertex 5 (3 connections) -> Shared connection with Vertex 7 -> Triangle <0, 5, 7>
2. Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 (7 connections), Vertex 6 (4 connections) -> Shared connection with Vertex 2 -> Triangle <0, 6, 2>
3. Edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 (7 connections), Vertex 7 (6 connections) -> Shared connection with Vertex 5 -> Triangle <0, 7, 5>
4. Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 (7 connections), Vertex 8 (2 connections) -> No triangle.
5. Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 (2 connections), Vertex 5 (3 connections) -> Shared connection with Vertex 7 -> Triangle <1, 5, 7>
6. Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 (2 connections), Vertex 7 (6 connections) -> No triangle.
7. Edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 (5 connections), Vertex 3 (2 connections) -> No triangle.
8. Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 (5 connections), Vertex 4 (2 connections) -> No triangle.

12. Edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 (2 connections), Vertex 6 (4 connections) -> No triangle.
13. Edge (4, 2): Vertex 4 (2 connections), Vertex 2 (5 connections) -> No triangle.

15. Edge (5, 1): Vertex 5 (3 connections), Vertex 1 (2 connections) -> Shared connection with Vertex 7 -> Triangle <5, 1, 7>
16. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 (3 connections), Vertex 7 (6 connections) -> No triangle.
17. Edge (6, 0): Vertex 6 (4 connections), Vertex 0 (7 connections) -> Shared connection with Vertex 2 -> Triangle <6, 0, 2>
18. Edge (6, 2): Vertex 6 (4 connections), Vertex 2 (5 connections) -> Shared connection with Vertex 0 -> Triangle <6, 2, 0>
