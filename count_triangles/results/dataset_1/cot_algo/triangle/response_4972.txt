Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph and the degree-based ordering method, the sorted vertices are as follows:
Nodes: 7, 5, 1, 6, 0, 4, 2, 8, 3, 9 

Using the sorted vertices, we can count the number of triangles and list them:
[12]
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 9, 2>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 4, 9>
