Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  

Node 6: 0 connections  
Nodes 1 and 4: 1 connection each  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Nodes 7 and 9: 3 connections  
Nodes 2 and 8: 4 connections  
Node 5: 5 connections  
Node 0: 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now trace the triangles in the graph.  

The total number of triangles is [6].  
The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 8>.
