Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following list: 

Node 4: Degree 0  
Node 7: Degree 0  
Node 0: Degree 2  
Node 5: Degree 2  
Node 6: Degree 2  
Node 1: Degree 3  
Node 3: Degree 3  
Node 9: Degree 4  
Node 8: Degree 4  
Node 2: Degree 5  

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges starting from the nodes with the lowest degrees.

1. For node 0: No triangles can be formed as it has degree 2.  
2. For node 5: No triangles can be formed as it has degree 2.  
3. For node 6: No triangles can be formed as it has degree 2.  
4. For node 1:  
   - Edge (1, 2) shares a connection with node 2.  
   - This forms a triangle <1, 2, 0>.  
5. For node 3:  
   - Edge (3, 2) forms a triangle <3, 2, 1>.  
6. For node 9:  
   - Edge (9, 2) forms a triangle <9, 2, 1>.  
   - Edge (9, 8) shares a connection with node 8, forming a triangle <9, 8, 1>.  
7. For node 8:  
   - No new triangles can be formed as the remaining edges either duplicate previously formed triangles or connect to higher-degree nodes.  
8. For node 2:  
   - No new triangles can be formed as the remaining edges either duplicate previously formed triangles or connect to higher-degree nodes.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 0>, <3, 2, 1>, <9, 2, 1>, and <9, 8, 1>.
