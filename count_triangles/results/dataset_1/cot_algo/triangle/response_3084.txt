Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph:

Sorting the vertices by the number of connections:
Vertices and their connections:
1. Vertex 7: 2 connections
2. Vertex 9: 1 connection
3. Vertex 1: 2 connections
4. Vertex 3: 2 connections
5. Vertex 4: 3 connections
6. Vertex 0: 3 connections
7. Vertex 8: 3 connections
8. Vertex 6: 4 connections
9. Vertex 5: 5 connections
10. Vertex 2: 6 connections

Reordering the vertices based on the above list:
- Vertex 9 (1 connection)
- Vertex 7 (2 connections)
- Vertex 3 (2 connections)
- Vertex 1 (2 connections)
- Vertex 4 (3 connections)
- Vertex 0 (3 connections)
- Vertex 8 (3 connections)
- Vertex 5 (5 connections)
- Vertex 6 (4 connections)
- Vertex 2 (6 connections)

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
