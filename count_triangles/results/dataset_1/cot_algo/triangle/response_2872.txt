Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):

Vertices sorted by degree:
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Now, we start counting triangles by traversing each edge in the order of the vertices with lower degree:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<3, 8, 0>
<0, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
