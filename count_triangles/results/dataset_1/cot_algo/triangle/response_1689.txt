Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 3: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 1: degree 6
Node 0: degree 6
Node 9: degree 6
Node 2: degree 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 5) forms triangle <0, 5, 8>
- Edge (0, 7) forms triangle <0, 7, 4>
- Edge (0, 8) forms triangle <0, 8, 5>
- Edge (0, 9) forms triangle <0, 9, 1>
- Edge (1, 2) forms triangle <1, 2, 4>
- Edge (2, 6) forms triangle <2, 6, 3>
- Edge (3, 5) forms triangle <3, 5, 8>
- Edge (3, 6) forms triangle <3, 6, 8>
- Edge (4, 7) forms triangle <4, 7, 9>
- Edge (5, 8) forms triangle <5, 8, 6>
- Edge (6, 9) forms triangle <6, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
