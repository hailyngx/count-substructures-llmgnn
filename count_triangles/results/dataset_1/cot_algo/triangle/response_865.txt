Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 5

Starting with the edge (0, 1), we see that vertex 0 has degree 2, which is less than vertex 1's degree of 5. 
Checking for shared connections of vertices 0 and 1, we find 1 shared connection with vertex 8. This forms a triangle <0, 1, 8>.

Following the same process for all edges, we find the following unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 7, 6>, <4, 2, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
