Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After organizing the vertices based on their degree in ascending order, the new vertex labels are:
- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 1 has degree 2
- Vertex 5 has degree 2
- Vertex 7 has degree 2
- Vertex 4 has degree 3
- Vertex 9 has degree 4
- Vertex 8 has degree 4
- Vertex 6 has degree 6
- Vertex 3 has degree 6
- Vertex 2 has degree 5

With these relabeled vertices, the edges to consider in order are:
(0, 3), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 6)

By following the process of counting triangles with the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles found in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
- <3, 6, 2>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>
