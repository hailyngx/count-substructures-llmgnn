Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Nodes: 8-6-7-4-1-9-2-0-3-5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can determine the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 1): Shared connections: None
2. Edge (0, 2): Shared connections: 3
3. Edge (0, 3): Shared connections: None
4. Edge (0, 5): Shared connections: None
5. Edge (0, 6): Shared connections: None
6. Edge (1, 8): Shared connections: None
7. Edge (2, 3): Shared connections: 0
8. Edge (2, 7): Shared connections: None
9. Edge (4, 5): Shared connections: None
10. Edge (4, 7): Shared connections: None
11. Edge (5, 9): Shared connections: None

Based on the shared connections above, the triangles in the graph are: 

[Total number of triangles: 1]
<0, 2, 3>
