Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Node 0 has 1 connection.
2. Node 1 has 0 connections.
3. Node 2 has 2 connections.
4. Node 3 has 2 connections.
5. Node 4 has 0 connections.
6. Node 5 has 1 connection.
7. Node 6 has 0 connections.
8. Node 7 has 4 connections.
9. Node 8 has 0 connections.
10. Node 9 has 1 connection.

Using this ordering, we analyze the edges:

1. (0, 5) - Node 0 < Node 5, Both connected to Node 7. Triangle found: <0, 5, 7>
2. (2, 3) - Node 2 < Node 3, Both connected to Node 7. Triangle found: <2, 3, 7>
3. (2, 7) - Node 2 < Node 7, Both connected to Node 3. Triangle found: <2, 7, 3>
4. (3, 2) - Node 2 < Node 3, Both connected to Node 7. Triangle found: <3, 2, 7>
5. (3, 7) - Node 3 < Node 7, Node 3 connected to Node 2, and Node 7 connected to 9. No triangle formed.
6. (5, 0) - Node 0 < Node 5, Both connected to Node 7. Triangle found: <5, 0, 7>
7. (7, 2) - Node 2 < Node 7, Both connected to Node 3. Triangle found: <7, 2, 3>
8. (7, 3) - Node 3 < Node 7, Node 3 connected to Node 2, and Node 7 connected to 9. No triangle formed.
9. (7, 9) - Node 7 < Node 9, No shared connection with Node 9.
10. (9, 7) - Node 7 < Node 9, No shared connection with Node 9.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 7, 3>
