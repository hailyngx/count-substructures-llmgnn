Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new vertex labels are as follows:
Vertices: 8 9 3 1 0 5 7 2 6 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
