Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and relabeling them accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices and relabeling them, the new order is: 
0 (degree 5), 4 (degree 4), 1 (degree 4), 2 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 3 (degree 5), 7 (degree 3), 8 (degree 4), 5 (degree 3), 9 (degree 2).

Using this relabeling, we can now determine the number of triangles formed in the graph:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle 3: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 4: <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 6: <3, 6, 8>
- Triangle 7: <3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
