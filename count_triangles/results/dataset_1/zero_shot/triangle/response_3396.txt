Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 1, 9>
<4, 3, 7>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
