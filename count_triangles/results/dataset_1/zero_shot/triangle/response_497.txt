Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected by edges. 

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <3, 5, 6>
2. <5, 7, 9>

There are a total of 2 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [2].
