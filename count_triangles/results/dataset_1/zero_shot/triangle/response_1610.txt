Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 17 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets []:

[<0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 9, 2>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 8, 4>, <3, 5, 0>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 9, 0>, <3, 9, 7>, <5, 0, 9>, <6, 1, 3>, <6, 2, 8>]
