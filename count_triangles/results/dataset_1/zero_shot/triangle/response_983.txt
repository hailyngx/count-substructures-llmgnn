Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 0>, <2, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <2, 1, 0>, <5, 7, 2>, <0, 3, 2>.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
