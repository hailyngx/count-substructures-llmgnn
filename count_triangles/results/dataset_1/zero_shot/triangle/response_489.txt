Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 7>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in total.
