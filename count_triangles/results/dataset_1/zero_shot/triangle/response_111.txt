Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 3, 5>, <1, 9, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, and <1, 5, 3>.
