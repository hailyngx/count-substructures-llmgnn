Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found: 
<0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 5>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 8, 3>.
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
