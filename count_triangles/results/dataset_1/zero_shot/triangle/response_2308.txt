Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by summing up the product of the degrees of neighboring nodes (i.e., the number of common neighbors that two nodes share). Since counting triangles can be a bit complex in large graphs, let's go through the process step by step.

First, we create a list to represent each node's neighbors:
- Node 0: [1, 2, 5, 6, 8]
- Node 1: [0, 2, 3, 4, 7]
- Node 2: [0, 1, 6, 8, 9]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [1, 5, 6, 7, 9]
- Node 5: [0, 4]
- Node 6: [0, 2, 4, 7]
- Node 7: [1, 4, 6]
- Node 8: [0, 2]
- Node 9: [2, 4]

Next, we identify the pairs of nodes that have common neighbors, as they form triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 3: <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle 4: <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle 5: <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle 6: <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle 7: <4, 6, 7>

After identifying the unique triangles, we can now calculate the total number of triangles:
The total number of triangles = 7
Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
