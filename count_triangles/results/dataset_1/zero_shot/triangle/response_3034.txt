Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 2, 9>
<5, 4, 9>
<9, 6, 7>
<9, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 unique triangles in the given graph.
