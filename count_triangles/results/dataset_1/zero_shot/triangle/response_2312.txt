Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed within brackets:

[<0, 4, 5> <0, 8, 1> <0, 9, 3> <4, 5, 8>]
