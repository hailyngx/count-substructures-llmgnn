Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 2>
<4, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
