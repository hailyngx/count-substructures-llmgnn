Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 9, 4>, <1, 6, 3>, <4, 1, 6>, <7, 5, 2>, <7, 8, 0>.

Therefore, the answer is [10].
