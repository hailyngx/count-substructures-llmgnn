Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 9, 2>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <6, 8, 6>.
