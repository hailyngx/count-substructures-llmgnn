Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
