Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 5, 6>
3. <1, 5, 4>
4. <1, 5, 2>
5. <5, 0, 6>
6. <5, 0, 1>
7. <5, 1, 6>
8. <5, 1, 2>
9. <7, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
