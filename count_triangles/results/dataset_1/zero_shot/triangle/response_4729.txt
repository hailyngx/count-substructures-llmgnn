Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: 

<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 5>
<5, 6, 0>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 7. 

So, the final answer is [7].
