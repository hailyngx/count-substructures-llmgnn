Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 1, 3>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
