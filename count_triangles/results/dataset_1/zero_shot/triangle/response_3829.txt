Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are: <2, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>.
