Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 6>, <2, 1, 8>, <2, 8, 5>, <2, 9, 0>, <2, 9, 6>, <5, 3, 6>, <5, 3, 7>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 7, 4>, <5, 8, 2>, <5, 8, 6>, <6, 0, 5>, <7, 4, 5>, <8, 2, 9>, <8, 5, 6>, <9, 0, 6>, <9, 0, 2>.
Therefore, there are a total of [21] triangles in the given graph.
