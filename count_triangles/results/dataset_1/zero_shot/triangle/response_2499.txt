Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 4>
<2, 1, 9>
<3, 4, 7>

Hence, there are [5] triangles in the graph.
