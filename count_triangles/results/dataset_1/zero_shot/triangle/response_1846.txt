Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 0>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 9, 6>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
