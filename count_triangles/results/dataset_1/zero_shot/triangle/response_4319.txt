Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges can be found by examining the possible triangles formed by the given edges. 

Upon analyzing the given graph, we find the following triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
