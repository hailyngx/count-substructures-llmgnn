Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [20].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 1, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 2>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 3>
<6, 9, 7>
<6, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<7, 5, 9>
<8, 3, 7>
<9, 7, 5>
<4, 2, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
