Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique combinations of three nodes that are all connected by edges. 

Upon examining the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 9, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<4, 2, 9>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 9, 8>
<5, 6, 4>
<8, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
