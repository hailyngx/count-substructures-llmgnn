Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
There are 20 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 8> 

So, the final answer is [20].
