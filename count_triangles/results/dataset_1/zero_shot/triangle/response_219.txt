Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here are the triangles listed within brackets: 

[<0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 7>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
