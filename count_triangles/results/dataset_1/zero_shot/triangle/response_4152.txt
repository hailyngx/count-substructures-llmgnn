Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated using the concept of triangles in graph theory that involves finding the number of closed walks of length 3.

After examining the provided edges, the unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
