Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
- 0: 3, 9
- 1: 2, 9
- 2: 1
- 3: 0, 7, 9
- 6: 7
- 7: 3, 6, 9
- 9: 0, 1, 3, 7

Let's count the number of triangles in the graph.

The triangles in the graph are formed by cycles of length 3. A triangle involves three vertices connected by edges.

By observing the graph, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <3, 6, 7>
4. <3, 7, 9>
5. <0, 3, 7>
6. <0, 7, 9>
7. <1, 9, 7>
8. <1, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total. [8]
