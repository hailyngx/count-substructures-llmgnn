Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 5, 6>, and <2, 7, 8>.
