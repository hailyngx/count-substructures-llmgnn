Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles: <1, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <6, 5, 7>.  
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
