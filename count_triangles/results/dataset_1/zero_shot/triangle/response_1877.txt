Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [18] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 9, 5>, <0, 9, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <6, 1, 5>, <2, 7, 3>, <3, 4, 2>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 9, 6>, <9, 0, 8>, <9, 5, 1>, <7, 2, 4>, <0, 9, 6>, <0, 8, 6>, <3, 0, 8>, <3, 2, 7> 

So the final answer is: [18].
