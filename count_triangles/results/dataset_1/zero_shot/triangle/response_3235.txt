Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 0>
<1, 9, 6>
<1, 9, 0>
<2, 4, 5>
<5, 2, 4>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 7>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 15 unique triangles in the graph. 
The final answer is [15].
