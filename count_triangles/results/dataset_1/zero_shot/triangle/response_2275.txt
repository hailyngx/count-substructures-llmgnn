Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are: <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 8>.
