Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 8, 6>
<2, 0, 3>
<2, 3, 6>
<4, 1, 6>
<6, 1, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
