Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, there are 5 triangles present. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 4, 8>, <2, 1, 7>, <5, 4, 6>, <6, 2, 5>, <6, 7, 8>]  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
