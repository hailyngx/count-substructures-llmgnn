Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of paths of length 2 between each unique set of three vertices.

By examining the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 8, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 0, 7>, <6, 5, 8>, <7, 0, 6>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 7, 7>, <7, 8, 5>, <7, 9, 4>, <8, 1, 0>, <8, 3, 4>, <8, 5, 6>, <8, 6, 7>, <8, 7, 8>, <8, 8, 4>, <8, 9, 5>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 5, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is counted as 25. Hence, the output is [25].
