Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 9, 6>, <5, 7, 3>, <5, 7, 7>, and <9, 2, 4> triangles.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
