Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

```
    0 -- 5
    |   /
    |  /
    8 1
    |  \
    |   \
    7 -- 6 -- 9
     \  / |   |
      \/_ |   |
         2 -- 4
          \  /
           3
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we can check every possible set of three nodes and see if they form a triangle by having edges between all pairs of the three nodes.

After analyzing the graph, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 6, 4>
- <2, 6, 1>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <3, 2, 4>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <6, 1, 8>
- <6, 4, 9>

There are 10 unique triangles in total.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
