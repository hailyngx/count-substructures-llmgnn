Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by identifying all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After examining the edges provided, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 2.
