Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: 
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 7, 9>. 

There are a total of 6 triangles in this graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [6].
