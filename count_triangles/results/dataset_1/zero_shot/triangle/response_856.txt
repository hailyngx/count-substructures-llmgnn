Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [9]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <6, 8, 9>.
