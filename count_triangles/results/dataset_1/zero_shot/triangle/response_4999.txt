Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each vertex is a part of and then dividing by 3 since each triangle is counted 3 times (once for each vertex). 

Upon counting, the triangles are:

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<5, 4, 9>
  
By summing up, we find that there are 5 triangles in the given graph, so the final answer is: [5].
