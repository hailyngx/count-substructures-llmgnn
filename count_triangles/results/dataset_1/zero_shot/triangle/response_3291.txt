Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 1, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
