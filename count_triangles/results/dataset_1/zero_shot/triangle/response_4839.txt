Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

```
0 -- 6 -- 1
|    |    |
8 -- 4 -- 5
|    |    |
2 -- 7 -- 9
|
3
```

There are 4 triangles in this graph, which are:
<0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 4>, <2, 5, 7>, <5, 4, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
