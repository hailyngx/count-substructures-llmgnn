Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by finding all the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle 1: <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle 2: <1, 6, 4>
3. Triangle 3: <2, 3, 9>
4. Triangle 4: <2, 9, 4>
5. Triangle 5: <3, 9, 5>
6. Triangle 6: <5, 8, 9>
7. Triangle 7: <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [7].
