Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

```
    1 -- 4
   / \   |
  0 - 7  9
   \ /   |
    5 -- 2
     \  /
      8
      |
      6
```

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we will need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges. Let's list out the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 5, 2>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <1, 4, 2>
5. <1, 4, 9>
6. <2, 4, 9>
7. <3, 5, 9>
8. <6, 7, 0>
9. <6, 7, 3>
10. <6, 8, 0>
11. <6, 8, 5>
12. <6, 8, 9>

There are 12 unique triangles in the graph, so the final answer is [12].
