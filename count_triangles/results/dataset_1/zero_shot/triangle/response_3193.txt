Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles: <0, 1, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 3>, <4, 3, 5>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 4, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
