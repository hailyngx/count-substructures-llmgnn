Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: 8
Therefore, the answer is [8].
