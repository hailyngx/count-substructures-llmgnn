Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [18] triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 0>, <7, 9, 0>, <7, 9, 6>, <7, 9, 0>, <7, 9, 6>, <7, 0, 8>, <7, 0, 4>, <8, 0, 7> [These triangles are counted based on the given edges connecting the nodes.]
