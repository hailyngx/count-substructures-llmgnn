Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected by edges.

Given the edges provided, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 2>
<3, 0, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 0, 8>
<5, 1, 7>
<5, 1, 2>
<5, 2, 1>
<5, 2, 7>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 7, 1>
<5, 7, 2>
<5, 7, 3>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 7, 5>
<7, 3, 5>
<7, 5, 1>
<7, 5, 8>
<8, 0, 4>
<8, 4, 0>
<8, 4, 5>
<8, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [24] and these triangles can be represented as <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 2>, <3, 0, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 0, 8>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 1, 2>, <5, 2, 1>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 3, 7>, <5, 7, 1>, <5, 7, 2>, <5, 7, 3>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 7, 5>, <7, 3, 5>, <7, 5, 1>, <7, 5, 8>, <8, 0, 4>, <8, 4, 0>, <8, 4, 5>, <8, 5, 7>.
