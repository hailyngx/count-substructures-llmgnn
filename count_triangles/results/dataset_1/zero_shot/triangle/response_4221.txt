Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 3>, <3, 6, 2>, <3, 8, 9>, and <3, 9, 1>.
