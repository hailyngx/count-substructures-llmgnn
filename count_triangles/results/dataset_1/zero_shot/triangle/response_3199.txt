Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by finding the number of unique triangles formed by three nodes.

From the given edges, the triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <3, 4, 6>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <6, 7, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
