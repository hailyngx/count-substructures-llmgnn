Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
  
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 8, 1>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
<7, 4, 9>
<7, 8, 0>
<8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
