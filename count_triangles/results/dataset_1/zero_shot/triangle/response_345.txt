Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 8> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
