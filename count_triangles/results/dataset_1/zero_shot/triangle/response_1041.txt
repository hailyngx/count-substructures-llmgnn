Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>]
