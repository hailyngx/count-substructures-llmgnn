Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are:
<0, 6, 3>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 9, 5>
<8, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
