Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
[<2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 9>] 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
