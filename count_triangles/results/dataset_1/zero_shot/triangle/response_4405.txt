Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph:

[<1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 2>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 0>]
