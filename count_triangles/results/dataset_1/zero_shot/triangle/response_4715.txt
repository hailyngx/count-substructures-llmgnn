Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the edges. Let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle formed by nodes 0, 2, and 5.
2. Triangle formed by nodes 0, 4, and 7.
3. Triangle formed by nodes 0, 5, and 8.
4. Triangle formed by nodes 2, 5, and 9.
5. Triangle formed by nodes 3, 4, and 8.

There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. Thus, the answer is [5].
