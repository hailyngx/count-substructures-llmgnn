Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, and <2, 5, 4>.
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
