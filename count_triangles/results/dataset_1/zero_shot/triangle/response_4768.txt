Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in total in this graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:

<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 9, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<9, 8, 2>

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
