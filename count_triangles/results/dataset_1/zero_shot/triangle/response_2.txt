Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph given has the following triangles:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 1, 5>
<6, 2, 3>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
