Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be found by checking each set of three nodes that are all mutually connected.

The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 4>
<6, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
