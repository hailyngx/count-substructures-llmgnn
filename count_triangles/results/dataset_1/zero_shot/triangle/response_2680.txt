Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by examining all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are connected to each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
