Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<2, 7, 4>, <1, 8, 7>, <2, 9, 3>, <6, 8, 7>, <6, 9, 3>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
