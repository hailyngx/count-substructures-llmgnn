Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 9>]
