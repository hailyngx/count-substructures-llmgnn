Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 9>.
