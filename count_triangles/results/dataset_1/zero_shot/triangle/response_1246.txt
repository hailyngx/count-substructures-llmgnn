Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 0, 7>
<3, 2, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 1>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
