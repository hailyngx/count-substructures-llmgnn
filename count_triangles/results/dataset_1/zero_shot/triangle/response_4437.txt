Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: <0, 3, 1>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 5>, <3, 1, 9>, <6, 1, 9>, <7, 8, 2>, <7, 9, 6>. 

There are 8 unique triangles in total.

Therefore, the final answer is: [8].
