Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<8, 0, 5>
<8, 1, 4>
<8, 2, 3>
<8, 2, 8>
<8, 3, 6>
<8, 4, 8>
<8, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [16].
