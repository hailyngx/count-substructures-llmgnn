Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 3>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
