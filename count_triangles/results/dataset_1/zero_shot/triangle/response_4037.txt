Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 7>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 4, 9>, and <9, 1, 2>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
