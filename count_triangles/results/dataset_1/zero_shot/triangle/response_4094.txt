Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 4>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 4>
<7, 9, 8>
<8, 9, 4>
<8, 9, 7>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
