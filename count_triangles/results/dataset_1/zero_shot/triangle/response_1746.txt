Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 7, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 5>
<7, 6, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
