Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting how many sets of three nodes are connected by edges to each other. Let's find the triangles in this graph:

<0, 2, 8>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 8, 4>
<1, 0, 7>
<2, 0, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 4, 8>
<6, 4, 7>
<8, 2, 0>
<8, 4, 5>

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [13].
