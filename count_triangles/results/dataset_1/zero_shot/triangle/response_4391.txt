Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the graph. The answer is [10].
