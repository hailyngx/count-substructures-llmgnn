Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [16] unique triangles in the given graph:

<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 0>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 9, 8>
<1, 2, 0>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 1>
<2, 0, 5>
<2, 8, 4>
<2, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
