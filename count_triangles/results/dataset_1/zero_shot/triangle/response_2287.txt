Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
[<0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
