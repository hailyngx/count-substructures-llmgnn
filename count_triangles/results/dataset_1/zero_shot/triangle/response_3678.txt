Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by each triplet of nodes. Let's find all the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 7>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
8. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
9. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
10. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
11. Triangle <5, 6, 7>
12. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
13. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 13 unique triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [13].
