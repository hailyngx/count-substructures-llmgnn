Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <3, 1, 6>, <5, 4, 7>
[There are 5 triangles in total]
