Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 3>, <3, 5, 1>, and <3, 5, 7> triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
