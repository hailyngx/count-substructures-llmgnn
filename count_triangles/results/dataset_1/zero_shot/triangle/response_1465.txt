Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 9, 5>
<3, 1, 6>
<3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
