Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 7, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 9, 5>
<4, 6, 7>
<9, 5, 7>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
