Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is involved in.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
