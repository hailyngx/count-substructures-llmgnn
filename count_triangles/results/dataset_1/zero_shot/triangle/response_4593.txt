Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, and <3, 5, 9>. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
