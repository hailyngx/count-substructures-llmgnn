Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are: <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 8>.
