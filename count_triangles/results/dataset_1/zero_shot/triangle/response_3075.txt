Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 6, 5>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 0>
<8, 9, 6>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
