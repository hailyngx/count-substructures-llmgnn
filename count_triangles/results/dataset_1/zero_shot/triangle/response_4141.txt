Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 8, 2>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 9, 7>. 

So, the final answer is [9].
