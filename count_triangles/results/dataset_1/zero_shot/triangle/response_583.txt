Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are fully connected. Let's calculate the number of triangles:

- Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 8 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 9 forms triangles with nodes 1, 3, 4, and 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 19. Here are the unique triangles found:
<1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 9, 7>, <5, 9, 3>, <6, 8, 2>

Thus, the final answer is [19].
