Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
