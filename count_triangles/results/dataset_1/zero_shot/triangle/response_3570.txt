Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<7, 5, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [6] triangles in the provided graph.
