Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <9, 1, 2>, <9, 1, 5>, <9, 1, 7>, <9, 2, 5>, <9, 2, 7>, <9, 5, 7>

There are a total of 15 triangles in the given graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
