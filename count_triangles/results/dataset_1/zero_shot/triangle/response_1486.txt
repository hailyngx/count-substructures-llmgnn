Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 8, 4>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 9, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 5>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 5, 8>, <7, 6, 9>

There are 14 unique triangles in total, therefore the final answer is: [14]
