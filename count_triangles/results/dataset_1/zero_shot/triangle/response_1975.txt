Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 9>

There are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [11].
