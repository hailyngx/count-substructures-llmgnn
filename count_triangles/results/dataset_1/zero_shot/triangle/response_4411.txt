Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 9), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (7, 1), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 3)}

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 8, 7>
<1, 8, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 9, 2>
<6, 4, 1>
<8, 7, 1>
<8, 5, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles are <1, 6, 2>, <1, 8, 7>, and <1, 8, 5>.
