Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 1>, <3, 1, 8>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in total.
