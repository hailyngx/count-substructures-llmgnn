Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
