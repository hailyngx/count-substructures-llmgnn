Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of [17] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 7, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 3, 6>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 4>
<8, 4, 6>
<8, 6, 7>
<9, 0, 1> 

Therefore, the final answer is [17].
