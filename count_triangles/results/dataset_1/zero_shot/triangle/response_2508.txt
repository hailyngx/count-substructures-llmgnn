Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 2, 6>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
