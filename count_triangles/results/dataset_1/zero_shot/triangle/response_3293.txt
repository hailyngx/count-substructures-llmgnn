Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
- (0, 6)
- (3, 8)
- (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7)
- (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 8)
- (7, 4), (7, 5)
- (8, 3), (8, 6)

Let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

[The answer inside brackets []: <4, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>]
