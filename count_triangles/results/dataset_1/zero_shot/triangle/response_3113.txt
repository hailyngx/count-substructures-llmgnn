Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 7, 0>, <0, 9, 5>, <0, 9, 2>, <2, 7, 6>, <2, 7, 3>.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
