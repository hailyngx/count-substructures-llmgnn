Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 -- 3
|    |
6 -- 1 -- 4 -- 8
|         |    |
7 -- 2    9 -- 5
```  

There are 5 triangles in this graph.  

The triangles are:  
<0, 1, 6>  
<1, 4, 8>  
<1, 4, 9>  
<2, 7, 9>  
<2, 5, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
