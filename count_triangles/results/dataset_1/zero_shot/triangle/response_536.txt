Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 2>

Therefore, the answer is [4].
