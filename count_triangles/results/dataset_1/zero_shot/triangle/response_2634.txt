Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
