Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be found by identifying the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. 

Let's list the unique triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 5, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [2].
