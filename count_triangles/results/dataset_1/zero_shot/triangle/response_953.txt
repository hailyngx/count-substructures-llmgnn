Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <0, 9, 7>
5. <1, 5, 7>
6. <1, 9, 7>
7. <3, 8, 6>
8. <3, 8, 7>
9. <3, 9, 7>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [9].
