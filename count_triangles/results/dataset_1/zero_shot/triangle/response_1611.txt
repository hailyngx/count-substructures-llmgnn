Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 6>
<7, 0, 5>
<8, 6, 1>
The number of triangles in the graph is [9].
