Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 8, 4>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 0, 8>
<6, 2, 8>
<8, 4, 9>
<9, 1, 7>

There are 12 triangles in total. Thus, the answer is [12].
