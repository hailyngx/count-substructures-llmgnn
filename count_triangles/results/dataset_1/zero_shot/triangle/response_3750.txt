Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 0>
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 1, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
