Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all unique combinations of three connected nodes. 

Upon examining the given graph, we can see that the triangles formed are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
