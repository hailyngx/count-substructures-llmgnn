Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 5. 

Here are the unique triangles found:
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 7, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<8, 7, 5>
<0, 6, 8>

So, the final answer is [5].
