Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 8, 2>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 9, 1>, <0, 9, 8>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 7, 3>, <5, 2, 8>, <5, 4, 6>, <8, 9, 1>.  
Therefore, the final answer is [16].
