Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. Here is the list of unique triangles found in the given graph:

<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
