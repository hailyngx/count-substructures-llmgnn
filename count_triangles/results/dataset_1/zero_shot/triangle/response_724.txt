Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles:
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
