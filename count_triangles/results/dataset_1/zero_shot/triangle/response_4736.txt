Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph contains 8 triangles, which can be listed as follows: 
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 5>.
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
