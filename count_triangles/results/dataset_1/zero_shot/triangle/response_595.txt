Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 2>, <8, 9, 6>.

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
