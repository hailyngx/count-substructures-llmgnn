Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 8, 6>
<2, 0, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 0, 2>
<6, 0, 5>
<6, 3, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 4, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [15].
