Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 8, 6>
<2, 7, 3>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
