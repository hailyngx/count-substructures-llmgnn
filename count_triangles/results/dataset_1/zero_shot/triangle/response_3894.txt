Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 5, 8>, and <5, 8, 9>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
