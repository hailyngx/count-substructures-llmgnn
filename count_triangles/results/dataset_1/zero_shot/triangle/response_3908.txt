Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 9>
There are 11 triangles found in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [11].
