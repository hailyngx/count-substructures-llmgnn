Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [8].
