Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 13 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 4, 0>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 0, 5>
<3, 5, 4>
<7, 5, 0>

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
