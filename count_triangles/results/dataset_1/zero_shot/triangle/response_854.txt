Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be calculated by examining all possible combinations of three nodes that are interconnected. 

After reviewing the given edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 3, 6>, 
<0, 3, 7>, 
<0, 3, 8>, 
<1, 3, 6>, 
<1, 3, 7>, 
<1, 3, 8>, 
<1, 6, 7>, 
<1, 6, 8>, 
<1, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
