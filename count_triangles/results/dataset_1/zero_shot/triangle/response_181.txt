Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by finding the number of paths of length 2 between each pair of nodes. Since a triangle consists of three nodes connected to each other, we are essentially looking for nodes that are connected in such a way that they form a triangular shape.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's analyze the triangles:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.

Analyzing the connections, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 9, 7>
- Triangle 4: <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle 5: <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle 6: <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
