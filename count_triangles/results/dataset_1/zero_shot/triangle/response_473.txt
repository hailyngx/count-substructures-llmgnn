Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 8, 9>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
