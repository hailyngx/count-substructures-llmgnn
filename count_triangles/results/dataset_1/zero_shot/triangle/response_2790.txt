Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be counted by finding all the cycles of length 3. 

Below are the triangles found in the graph:
- <1, 6, 2>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <1, 9, 4>
- <1, 9, 6>
- <2, 6, 1>
- <2, 6, 3>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <3, 6, 1>
- <3, 6, 2>
- <4, 9, 1>
- <4, 9, 6>
- <6, 1, 8>
- <6, 1, 9>
- <6, 2, 3>
- <6, 2, 7>
- <6, 3, 2>
- <6, 9, 1>
- <6, 9, 4>
- <7, 2, 6>
- <8, 1, 6>
- <9, 1, 4>
- <9, 1, 6>
- <9, 4, 7>

The number of triangles in the given graph is [24].
