Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
By enumerating all possible triangles in the given graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 4, 1>, <1, 0, 4>, <1, 4, 0>, <5, 0, 7>, <5, 7, 0>, <7, 0, 5>, <7, 5, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
