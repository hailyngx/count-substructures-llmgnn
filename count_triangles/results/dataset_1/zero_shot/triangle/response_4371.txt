Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of closed paths of length 3 within the graph. In this case, we can simply count the triangles by inspecting the graph's edges. 

After examining the given graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 3, 0>
<1, 5, 0>
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 7, 4>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 1>
<4, 5, 9>
<7, 1, 8>
<7, 1, 3>
<7, 9, 8>
<9, 5, 0>
<9, 5, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
