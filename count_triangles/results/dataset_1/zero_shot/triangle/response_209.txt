Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 4, 3>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 8, 7>, <2, 0, 3>, <2, 0, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 2>, <6, 1, 8>, <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in total. 
So, the answer is [11].
