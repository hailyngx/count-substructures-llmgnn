Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <0, 6, 1>
5. <0, 6, 9>
6. <1, 6, 9>
7. <1, 8, 3>
8. <2, 5, 3>
9. <4, 7, 5>
10. <4, 6, 9>
11. <5, 2, 3>
12. <5, 7, 9>
13. <6, 4, 7>
14. <6, 9, 7>
15. <7, 9, 4>
16. <8, 1, 6>
17. <8, 3, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [17] triangles in the graph.
