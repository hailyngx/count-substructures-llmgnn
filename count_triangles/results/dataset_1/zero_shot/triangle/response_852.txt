Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 2>
<1, 8, 5>
<4, 2, 5>
<9, 6, 4>

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in total.  
The final answer is: [7]
