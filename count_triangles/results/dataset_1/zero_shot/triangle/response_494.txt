Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 9>

There are 10 triangles in total. Hence, the answer is [10].
