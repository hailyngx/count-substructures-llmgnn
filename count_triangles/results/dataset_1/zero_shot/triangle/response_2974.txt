Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

[<0, 1, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 3>, <7, 1, 8>]

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
