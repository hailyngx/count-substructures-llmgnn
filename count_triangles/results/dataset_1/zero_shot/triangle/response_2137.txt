Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles: <0, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <6, 4, 9>.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the graph.
