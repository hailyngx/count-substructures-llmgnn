Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. Here are the unique triangles found:

<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
