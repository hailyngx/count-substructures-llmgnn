Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 0, 7>
<6, 2, 0>
<7, 1, 0>
<8, 2, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
