Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:
<1, 7, 3>
<1, 8, 4>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 7, 9>
<5, 3, 4>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
