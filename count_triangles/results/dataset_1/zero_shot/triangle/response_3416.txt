Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 9>

There are [3] triangles in total.
