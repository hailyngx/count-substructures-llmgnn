Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9
- Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8
- Node 5 is connected to node 0
- Node 6 is connected to node 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will look for all combinations of three nodes that are connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 9, 5>
2. <0, 9, 7>
3. <8, 9, 3>
4. <8, 9, 7>

Count of triangles: [4]
