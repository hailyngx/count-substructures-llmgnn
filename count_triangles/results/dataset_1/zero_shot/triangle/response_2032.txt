Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by identifying all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. 

The triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, 
<1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, 
<3, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
