Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be determined by finding nodes that form a cycle of length 3. Let's list the triangles and then count them.

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>

Count of triangles: [2]
