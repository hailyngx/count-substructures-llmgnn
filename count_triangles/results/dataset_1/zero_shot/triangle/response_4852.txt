Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by looking for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected with each other.

By examining the given edges, we can list the unique triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
