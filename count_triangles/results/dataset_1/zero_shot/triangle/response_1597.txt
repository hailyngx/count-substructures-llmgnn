Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The possible triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<5, 7, 0>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the graph. [5]
