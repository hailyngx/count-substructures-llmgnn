Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes connected by edges. In this case, we find the number of triangles to be 12. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 6, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 7, 5>
<2, 3, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 8, 3>
<4, 6, 1>
<7, 9, 3>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
