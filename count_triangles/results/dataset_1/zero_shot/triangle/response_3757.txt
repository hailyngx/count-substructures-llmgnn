Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangle in the given graph are:

<1, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in total. So, the final answer is [4].
