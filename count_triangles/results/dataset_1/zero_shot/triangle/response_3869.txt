Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
