Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<2, 3, 8>
<9, 5, 1>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the graph.
