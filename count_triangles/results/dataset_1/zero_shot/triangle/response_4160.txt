Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in this graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: 
<1, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 7>, <3, 9, 2>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
