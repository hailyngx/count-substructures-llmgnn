Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph, and they are as follows:
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
