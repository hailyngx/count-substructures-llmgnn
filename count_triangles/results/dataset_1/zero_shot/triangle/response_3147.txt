Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in this graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:

[<4, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <4, 1, 6>]
