Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [10].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 6>
<6, 8, 7>
<3, 6, 9>  

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
