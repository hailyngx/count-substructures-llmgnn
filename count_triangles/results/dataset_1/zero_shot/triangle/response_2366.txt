Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three nodes. Let's go ahead and find all the triangles:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
