Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of paths of length 2 between each set of three distinct nodes. Let's find and count the triangles:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 4, 6>
4. Triangle 4: <0, 4, 9>
5. Triangle 5: <0, 6, 8>
6. Triangle 6: <1, 4, 9>
7. Triangle 7: <2, 4, 7>
8. Triangle 8: <4, 6, 8>
9. Triangle 9: <4, 7, 9>
10. Triangle 10: <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 10, and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, and <6, 7, 8>.

So, the final answer is [10].
