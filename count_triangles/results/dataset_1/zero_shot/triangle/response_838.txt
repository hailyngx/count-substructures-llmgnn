Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
