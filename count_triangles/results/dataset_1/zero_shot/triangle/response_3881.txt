Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:
```
0 --- 4 --- 2 --- 5
|     |     |     |
6 --- 7     9
```

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

There are three possible triangles in this graph: <0, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, and <2, 5, 7>.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
