Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [16] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 9, 7>.
