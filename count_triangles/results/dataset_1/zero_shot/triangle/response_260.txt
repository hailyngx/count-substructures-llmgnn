Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of triangles each node is part of and then dividing this total count by 6 since each triangle is counted 3 times. 

For the given graph:
- Node 0 is part of 0 triangles
- Node 1 is part of 0 triangles
- Node 2 is part of 1 triangle: (2, 4, 6)
- Node 3 is part of 1 triangle: (3, 4, 6)
- Node 4 is part of 3 triangles: (0, 4, 9), (3, 4, 9), (2, 4, 3)
- Node 5 is part of 0 triangles
- Node 6 is part of 2 triangles: (3, 6, 7), (2, 6, 4)
- Node 7 is part of 2 triangles: (4, 7, 5), (3, 7, 8)
- Node 8 is part of 2 triangles: (1, 8, 3), (8, 9, 4)
- Node 9 is part of 2 triangles: (8, 9, 3), (4, 9, 3)

Adding these up, we get a total of 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13 triangles. 

Therefore, the answer is [13] with the unique triangles being:
<2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 3>, <3, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 4>, <4, 7, 5>, <3, 7, 8>, <1, 8, 3>, <8, 9, 4>, <8, 9, 3>, <4, 9, 3>
