Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found: 

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [10].
