Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

There are a total of 8 triangles in the graph. So, the final answer is [8].
