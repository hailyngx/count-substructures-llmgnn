Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles formed by every set of three nodes that are connected.

Upon examining the graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<1, 7, 3>, <1, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
