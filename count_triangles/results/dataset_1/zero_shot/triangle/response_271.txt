Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

- <1, 2, 3>
- <0, 5, 7>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the graph.
