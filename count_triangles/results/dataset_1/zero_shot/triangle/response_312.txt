Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of paths of length 2 between each node. Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph.

The triangles in this graph are formed by cycles of length 3, meaning they consist of three connected nodes.

For each node, we will look at all the pairs of its neighbors and check if there is an edge between those pairs to form a triangle.

Calculating for each node:
Node 0 forms triangles with nodes: <1, 7, 9>
Node 1 forms triangles with nodes: <0, 3, 4>
Node 2 forms triangles with nodes: <0, 5, 9>
Node 3 forms triangles with nodes: <1, 7, 8>
Node 4 forms triangles with nodes: <1>
Node 5 forms triangles with nodes: <2, 7>
Node 6 forms triangles with nodes: <0, 9>
Node 7 forms triangles with nodes: <0, 3, 5>
Node 8 forms triangles with nodes: <3, 9>
Node 9 forms triangles with nodes: <0, 2, 6, 8>

Combining all unique triangles found, we get the following:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 8>

Therefore, there are 13 unique triangles in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [13].
