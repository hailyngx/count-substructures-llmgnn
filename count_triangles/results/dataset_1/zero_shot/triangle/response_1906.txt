Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
In order to find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Let's go through the edges provided to find all the triangles:

The nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.

Now, let's list the unique triangles present in the graph:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <9, 6, 0>

As we have found all the unique triangles in the graph, we can now count them. The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
