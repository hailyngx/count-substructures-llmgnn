Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>
Hence, there are [6] triangles in total.
