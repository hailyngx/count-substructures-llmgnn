Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by finding all unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle: <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle: <0, 2, 9>
3. Triangle: <2, 4, 5>
4. Triangle: <2, 5, 6>
5. Triangle: <2, 5, 7>
6. Triangle: <3, 4, 7>
7. Triangle: <4, 8, 9>

Count of triangles = 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
