Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 8>, <7, 1, 9>, <8, 9, 7>.
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
