Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph given has the following triangles: <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 1, 9>, <6, 0, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, there are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph, which can be represented as [7].
