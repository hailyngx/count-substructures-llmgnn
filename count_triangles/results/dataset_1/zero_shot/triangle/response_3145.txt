Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by summing up the number of closed triangles each node is involved in. 

After analyzing the given graph, the triangles are as follows:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
