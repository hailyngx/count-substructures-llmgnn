Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 5>
<8, 5, 7>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
