Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 0>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 9, 7>, <6, 0, 1>, <6, 1, 8>, <6, 8, 1>.
