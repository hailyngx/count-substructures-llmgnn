Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 3, 2>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 4>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 2, 5>
<4, 1, 5>
<4, 1, 2>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 5>
<5, 7, 4>
<5, 2, 8>
<6, 4, 8>
<8, 5, 7>

There are 15 such triangles in total.  
Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
