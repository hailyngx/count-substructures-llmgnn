Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, the number of triangles can be found by looking at the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. Let's list out the triangles and count them:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
