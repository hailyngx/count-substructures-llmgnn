Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is 3.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 7, 6>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
