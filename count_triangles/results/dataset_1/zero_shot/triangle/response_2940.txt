Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 6, 5>
<1, 7, 3>
<1, 7, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 5>
<8, 4, 0>
<8, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
