Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles each consisting of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's find the triangles in this graph:

The triangles found in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
