Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
