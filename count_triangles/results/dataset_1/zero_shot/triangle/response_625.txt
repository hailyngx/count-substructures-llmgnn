Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 8, 4>
<1, 9, 3>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 9, 5>
<8, 2, 0>
<8, 4, 0>
<9, 5, 0>

There are a total of 11 triangles in the graph, which can be found in the output below:
