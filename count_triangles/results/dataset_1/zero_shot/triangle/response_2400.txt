Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found using the formula: 
\[ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{degree of node } i)^2}{2} - \text{number of edges} \]

Given that the graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first need to find the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 2

Calculating the number of triangles:
\[ \frac{(2^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 2^2)}{2} - 26 = 35 - 26 = 9 \]

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>

The final answer is [9].
