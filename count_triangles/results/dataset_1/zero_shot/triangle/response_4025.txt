Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 3, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
