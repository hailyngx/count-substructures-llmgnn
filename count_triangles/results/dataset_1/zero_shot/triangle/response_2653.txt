Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in this graph. Here they are listed below:

[<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 6>]
