Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 2 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<2, 9, 5>, <8, 6, 5>]
