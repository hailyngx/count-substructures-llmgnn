Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: 

<0, 4, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 7, 8>

There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
