Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [9] and they are as follows:

<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 6, 0>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<5, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 1>
