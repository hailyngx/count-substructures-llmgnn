Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
