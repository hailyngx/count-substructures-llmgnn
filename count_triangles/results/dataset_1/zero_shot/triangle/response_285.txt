Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, and <4, 6, 8>.
