Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 8, 9>
<4, 3, 1>
<4, 6, 8>
<8, 6, 4>
<8, 9, 1>
<9, 1, 4>

Therefore, the answer is [9].
