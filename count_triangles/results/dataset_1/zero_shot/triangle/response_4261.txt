Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node can form. Let's calculate it:

For node 0:
- Triangles with node 0: <0, 1, 4> and <0, 8, 2>

For node 1:
- Triangles with node 1: <1, 0, 4> and <1, 7, 3>

For node 2:
- Triangles with node 2: <2, 5, 3> and <2, 6, 4>

For node 3:
- Triangles with node 3: <3, 4, 5> and <3, 7, 1>

For node 4:
- Triangles with node 4: <4, 0, 1> and <4, 6, 2>

For node 5:
- Triangles with node 5: <5, 2, 9> and <5, 3, 4>

For node 6:
- Triangles with node 6: <6, 2, 4>

For node 7:
- Triangles with node 7: <7, 3, 9> and <7, 1, 0>

For node 8:
- Triangles with node 8: <8, 0, 2>

For node 9:
- Triangles with node 9: <9, 2, 5> and <9, 7, 3>

Therefore, the unique triangles formed in the given graph are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 8, 2>, <1, 7, 3>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 5, 3>, <3, 7, 1>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 2>, <5, 2, 9>, and <7, 9, 3>.

As there are 10 unique triangles found in total, the final count of the number of triangles in the graph is [10].
