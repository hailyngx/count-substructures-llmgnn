Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by the edges. Let's count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 5, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 4>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
6. Triangle <4, 6, 8>

Thus, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, and <4, 6, 8>.
