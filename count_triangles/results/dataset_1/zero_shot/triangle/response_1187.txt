Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 14 unique triangles in the given graph. They are: <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 8, 3>, <1, 9, 2>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <5, 0, 2>, <5, 0, 7>, <5, 2, 6>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 3, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <8, 3, 4>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
