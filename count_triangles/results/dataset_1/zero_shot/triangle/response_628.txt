Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 9, 5>, <2, 9, 3>, <5, 9, 2>, <5, 9, 3>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
