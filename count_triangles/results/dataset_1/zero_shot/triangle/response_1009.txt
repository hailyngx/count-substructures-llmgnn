Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
