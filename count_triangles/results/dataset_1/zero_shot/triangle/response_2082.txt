Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 3, 4>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 7, 8>, <1, 9, 7>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
