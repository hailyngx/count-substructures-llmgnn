Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 8>, <3, 1, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 8, 2>, <3, 8, 4>, <3, 8, 7>, <4, 7, 8>

There are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
