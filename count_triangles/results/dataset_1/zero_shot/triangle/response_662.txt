Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 0>

Total number of triangles: 7
Therefore, the final answer is [7].
