Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<[0, 1, 3]>, <[0, 2, 3]>, <[0, 3, 4]>, <[0, 3, 8]>, <[1, 3, 4]>, <[2, 3, 7]>, <[2, 3, 8]>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
