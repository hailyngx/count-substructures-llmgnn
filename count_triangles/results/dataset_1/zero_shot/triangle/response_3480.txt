Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 2>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
