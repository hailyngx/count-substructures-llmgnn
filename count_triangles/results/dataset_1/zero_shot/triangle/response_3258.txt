Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify each triangle by looking for nodes that are directly connected to each other forming a closed loop of three edges.

Analyzing the provided graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3.
- Node 5 is connected to node 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3.
- Node 8 is connected to node 1.

From the given edges, we can determine the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 4>

Thus, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [2].
