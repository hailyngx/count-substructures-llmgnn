Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles found in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 3>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 9, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
