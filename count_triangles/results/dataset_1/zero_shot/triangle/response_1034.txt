Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be found by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Upon examining the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 7, 2>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 4>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 9, 3>
<9, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. 

The final answer is [9].
