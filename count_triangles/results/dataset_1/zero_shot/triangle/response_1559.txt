Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
