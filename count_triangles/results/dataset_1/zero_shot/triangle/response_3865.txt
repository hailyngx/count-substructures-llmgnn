Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
