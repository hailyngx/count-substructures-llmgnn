Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here is a list of the unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
