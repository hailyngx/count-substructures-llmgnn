Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
