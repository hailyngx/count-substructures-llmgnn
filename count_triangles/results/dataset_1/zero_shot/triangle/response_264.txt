Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
[<4, 6, 7>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
