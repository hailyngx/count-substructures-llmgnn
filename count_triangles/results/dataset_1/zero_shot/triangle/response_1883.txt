Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be determined by looking at the number of triangles each node is a part of. Since each triangle consists of three nodes, we need to find the nodes that are connected to each other forming triangles.

Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

Node 0: (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 7), (0, 7, 9) - 3 triangles
Node 1: No triangles
Node 2: (1, 2, 5), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 7) - 3 triangles
Node 3: No triangles
Node 4: No triangles
Node 5: No triangles
Node 6: (2, 5, 6), (6, 5, 7) - 2 triangles
Node 7: (0, 4, 7), (7, 9, 0) - 2 triangles
Node 8: No triangles
Node 9: No triangles

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, and <2, 5, 7>. 

Thus, the final answer is [10].
