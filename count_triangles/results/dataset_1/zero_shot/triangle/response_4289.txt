Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 4>
<5, 4, 1>
<6, 0, 8>
<6, 3, 8>

Thus, there are 8 triangles in total. Hence, the answer would be [8].
