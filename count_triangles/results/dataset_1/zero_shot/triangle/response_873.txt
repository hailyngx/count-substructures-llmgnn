Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [18].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>
