Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 9, 3>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <5, 1, 8>.
