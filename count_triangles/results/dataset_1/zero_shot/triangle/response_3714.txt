Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
<2, 1, 4>
<3, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 8, 2>
The final answer is [4].
