Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
