Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 3>, <3, 4, 2>, <3, 7, 2>, <4, 2, 3>, <7, 2, 3>, <7, 3, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
