Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<2, 0, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 1, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <4, 9, 8>]
