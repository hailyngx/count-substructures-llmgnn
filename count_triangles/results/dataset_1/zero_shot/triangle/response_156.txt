Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

[<0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 0, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 0>, <3, 4, 9>, <6, 2, 5>, <8, 1, 9>]
