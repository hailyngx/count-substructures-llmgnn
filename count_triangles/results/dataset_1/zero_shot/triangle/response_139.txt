Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 -- 2 -- 9
    |         |
    0 -- 4    8 -- 3
            |    |
            5    6
```

Let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 9, 2>
2. <8, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
