Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 20 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<1, 2, 8>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 1, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 7, 1>, <3, 9, 6>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 1, 6>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 5>, <6, 4, 3>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 9, 3>, <8, 2, 1>
Therefore, the final answer is [20].
