Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:

<1, 2, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 4>
<2, 7, 6>
<2, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
