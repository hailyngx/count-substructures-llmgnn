Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 3>
<1, 7, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [8].
