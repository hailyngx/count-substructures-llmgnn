Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=0}^{10} d_i \cdot (d_i - 1) \cdot (d_i - 2) \]

where \(d_i\) is the degree of node i.

Let's calculate the number of triangles:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \left( 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0 \cdot -1 + 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 + 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 + 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 \right) = 24 \]

Therefore, there are 24 triangles in the given graph. Let's list them inside brackets:

\[ [ <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 0>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 4, 0>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 0, 2>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 2, 0>, <4, 3, 6>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 1>, <6, 0, 4>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 4, 0>, <9, 7, 0> ] \]
