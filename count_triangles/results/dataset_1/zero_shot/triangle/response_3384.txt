Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following edges:
- (0, 3), (0, 4)
- (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 9)
- (2, 1), (2, 9)
- (3, 0), (3, 1)
- (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 8)
- (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)
- (6, 5)
- (7, 5)
- (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 9)
- (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 8)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

[There are a total of 4 triangles in this graph.]

The unique triangles are:
<1, 2, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
