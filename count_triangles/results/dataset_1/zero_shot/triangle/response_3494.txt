Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles passing through each node. 

After calculating, there are 8 total triangles in the graph: 

- <0, 5, 6>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <6, 8, 9>
- <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
