Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 9, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 8, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 8, 1>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 7, 2>, <5, 8, 1>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 9, 0>, <7, 9, 4>, <8, 5, 1>
Therefore, there are [23] triangles in the given graph.
