Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 3>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 9, 2>
<7, 9, 4>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [12].
