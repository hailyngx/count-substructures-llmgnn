Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles formed by each set of three nodes. After analyzing the given graph, the triangles present are:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 9, 6>
<0, 9, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 9, 6>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 9, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles present in the graph is [19].
