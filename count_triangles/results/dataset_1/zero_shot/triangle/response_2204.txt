Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 5>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
