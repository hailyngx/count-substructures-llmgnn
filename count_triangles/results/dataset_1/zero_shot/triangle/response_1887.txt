Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is part of and then dividing by 3, since each triangle is counted 3 times.

After calculating, the answer is [6].

The unique triangles are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 4>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 9>.
