Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 3> 
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
