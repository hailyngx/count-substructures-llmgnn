Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of and then dividing the total count by 3 as each triangle is counted thrice (once for each node in the triangle).

Calculating the number of triangles:
- Node 0 is part of triangles: {0, 1, 7}, {0, 5, 7}
- Node 1 is part of triangles: {1, 0, 7}, {1, 7, 8}
- Node 5 is part of triangles: {5, 0, 2}, {5, 0, 8}, {5, 2, 8}
- Node 7 is part of triangles: {7, 0, 1}, {7, 1, 8}
- Node 8 is part of triangles: {8, 1, 5}, {8, 5, 7}

Total count of triangles = 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 11

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [11].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<5, 0, 2>
<5, 0, 8>
<5, 2, 8>
<7, 0, 1>
<7, 1, 8>
<8, 1, 5>
<8, 5, 7>
