Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node participates in.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:

<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 7, 5>
<4, 6, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
