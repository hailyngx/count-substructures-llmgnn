Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are total of [48] triangles in the given graph.  

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 6, 5>
<2, 0, 7>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 1, 6>
<3, 6, 5>
<4, 1, 7>
<4, 1, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 1, 4>
<6, 3, 8>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 2, 4>
<8, 0, 3>
<9, 0, 4>  

Therefore, the final answer is [24].
