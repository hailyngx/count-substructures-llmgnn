Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, 1, 6>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 7, 6>
<1, 8, 6>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 9, 3>

Therefore, the answer is [6].
