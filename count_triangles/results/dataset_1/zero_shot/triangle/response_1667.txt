Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:
<0, 1, 4>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 8, 9>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 0, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
