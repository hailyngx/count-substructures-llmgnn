Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 1>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in total in the given graph.
