Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 unique triangles in this graph. Here they are: 
<1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 9, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
