Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in total. 
So, the final answer is [3].
