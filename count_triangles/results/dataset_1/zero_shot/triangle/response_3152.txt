Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [9] triangles in the given graph, which are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 9>.
