Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 2>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 2>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 9, 7>
<7, 8, 1>
<7, 8, 3>
<8, 0, 1>
<8, 0, 6>
<8, 0, 9>
<8, 1, 9>
<8, 3, 4>
<8, 6, 0>
<8, 6, 9>
<8, 7, 1>

Therefore, there are 24 triangles in total. The final answer is [24].
