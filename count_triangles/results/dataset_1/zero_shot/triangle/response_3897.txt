Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges.

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
