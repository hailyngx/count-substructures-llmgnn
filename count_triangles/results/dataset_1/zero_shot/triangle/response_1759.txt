Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 8, 5>
<8, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
