Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [38] edges in the given graph.

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all possible combinations of nodes that form triangles.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <1, 3, 6>
5. <1, 3, 9>
6. <2, 4, 6>
7. <2, 4, 7>
8. <2, 6, 7>
9. <2, 6, 9>
10. <3, 4, 6>
11. <3, 6, 7>
12. <3, 6, 9>
13. <4, 6, 7>
14. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are listed inside brackets as requested: [<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>].
