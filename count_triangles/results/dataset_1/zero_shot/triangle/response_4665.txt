Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles can be represented as:

<0, 2, 3>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<6, 1, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
