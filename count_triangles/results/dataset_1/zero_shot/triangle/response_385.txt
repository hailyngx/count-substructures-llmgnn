Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
    
    0 --- 1 --- 2
    |     |     |
    |     |     |
    3 --- 4     8
        /     /
       5 ---/
       |
       |
       6 --- 9 --- 7

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all sets of nodes that are fully connected with three edges. 

There are a total of 4 triangles in this graph: <0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 9, 6>, <1, 9, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
