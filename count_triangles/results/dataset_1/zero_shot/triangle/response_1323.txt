Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 9, 3>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 7, 0>

There are 11 triangles in total in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
