Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that form a triangle by having edges connecting all three nodes.

Let's list out the triangles based on the provided edges:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 2, 3>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <1, 6, 9>
5. <4, 6, 9>
6. <6, 8, 9>

So, there are 6 triangles in total in the given graph. The final answer is [6].
