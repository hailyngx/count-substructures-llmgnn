Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, let's first identify all possible triangles using the given edges:

1. (0, 6, 2)
2. (0, 6, 9)
3. (2, 3, 5)
4. (2, 6, 9)
5. (3, 5, 7)
6. (3, 6, 9)

Therefore, based on the given graph, the total number of triangles that can be formed is [6].

Thus, the answer is [6].
