Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 2, 5>, <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
