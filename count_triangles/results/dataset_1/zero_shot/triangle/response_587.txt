Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<5, 9, 2>
<2, 5, 9>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the graph.
