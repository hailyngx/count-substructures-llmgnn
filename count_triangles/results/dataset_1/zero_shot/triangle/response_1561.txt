Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 37 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 7, 1>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 4>, <3, 2, 6>, <3, 2, 8>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 2, 5>, <4, 2, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 2, 4>, <5, 2, 6>, <5, 3, 4>, <5, 3, 6>, <6, 2, 3>, <6, 2, 4>, <6, 2, 8>, <6, 3, 5>, <6, 3, 8>, <6, 4, 5>, <6, 4, 2>, <6, 8, 2>, <7, 0, 1>, <7, 1, 0>, <8, 2, 3>, <8, 2, 6>, <8, 3, 2>, <8, 6, 2>, <9, 1, 7>, <9, 7, 1>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [37].
