Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles: <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 8>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
