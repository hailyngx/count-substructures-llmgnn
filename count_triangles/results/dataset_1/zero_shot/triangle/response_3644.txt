Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
