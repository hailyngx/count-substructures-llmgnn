Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

\[<0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 5, 2>, <1, 4, 2>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 0>, <4, 0, 5>, <4, 1, 7>, <6, 5, 0>, <6, 5, 9>, <7, 1, 4>\]

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
