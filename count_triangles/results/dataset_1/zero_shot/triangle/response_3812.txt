Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 4>
<1, 5, 0>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 0>
<4, 8, 6>
<5, 0, 1>
<5, 4, 6>
<6, 3, 9>
<6, 4, 8>
<6, 9, 3>
<7, 0, 4>
<9, 1, 5>
<9, 3, 6>
<9, 6, 4>
<9, 7, 0>

There are a total of 19 triangles.  
Therefore, the final answer is [19].
