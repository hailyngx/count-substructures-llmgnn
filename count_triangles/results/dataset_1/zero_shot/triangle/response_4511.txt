Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by examining the possible triangles formed by choosing 3 nodes from the 10 nodes in the graph.

The unique triangles in this graph are: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 9>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
