Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles: <0, 4, 2>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 1>, <6, 8, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
