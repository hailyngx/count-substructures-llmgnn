Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [14] unique triangles in the given graph:
<0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 9, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 6, 1>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>
