Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. 

Calculating the number of triangles...

[6]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 9> 

Therefore, the answer is [6].
