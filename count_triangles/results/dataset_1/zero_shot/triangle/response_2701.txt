Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated using the number of triangles each node is involved in. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <2, 7, 8>
6. <2, 7, 9>
7. <2, 8, 9>
8. <4, 6, 9>
9. <4, 7, 9>
10. <5, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
