Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
    
    1 -- 4
     \     
      5 -- 8
     /|  X |
    0 |   \|
     \|    7
      2 -- 9

Triangles in this graph are:
[<0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>] 

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in total. Thus, the final answer is [6].
