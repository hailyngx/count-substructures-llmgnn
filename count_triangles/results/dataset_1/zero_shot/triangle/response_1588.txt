Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique triangles in this graph. The triangles are:
<4, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<0, 8, 4>
<3, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
