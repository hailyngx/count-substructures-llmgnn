Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [14] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 9, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <8, 1, 4>, <8, 6, 7>, <8, 6, 9>, <9, 5, 7>.
