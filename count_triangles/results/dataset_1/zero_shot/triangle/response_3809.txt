Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<2, 4, 9>, <5, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
