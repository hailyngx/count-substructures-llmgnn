Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 7, 5>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 7, 5>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [12].
