Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<3, 9, 0>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 7, 8>
<9, 4, 0>

Total number of triangles: 7
Therefore, the final answer is [7].
