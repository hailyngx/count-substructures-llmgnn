Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The count of triangles in the given graph is [<<2, 5, 8>>, <<4, 8, 9>>]. The number of triangles is [2].
