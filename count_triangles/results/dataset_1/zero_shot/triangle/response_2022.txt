Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <5, 6, 7>

There are 10 unique triangles in total. Hence, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
