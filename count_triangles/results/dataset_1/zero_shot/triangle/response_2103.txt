Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 8, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <6, 4, 7>, <8, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
