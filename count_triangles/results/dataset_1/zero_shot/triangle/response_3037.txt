Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 0, 6>, <6, 4, 6>, <7, 1, 6>.

Therefore, the answer is [9].
