Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 12 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 0, 2>, <2, 1, 0>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 3>, <2, 7, 5>, <2, 8, 6>, <2, 9, 3>. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
