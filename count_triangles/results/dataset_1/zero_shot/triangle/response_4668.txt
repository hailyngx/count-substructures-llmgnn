Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<8, 9, 1>

There are a total of 12 triangles in the graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [12].
