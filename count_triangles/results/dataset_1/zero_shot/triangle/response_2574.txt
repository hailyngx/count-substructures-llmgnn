Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 4>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 0>
<8, 9, 3>

So, the final answer is [10].
