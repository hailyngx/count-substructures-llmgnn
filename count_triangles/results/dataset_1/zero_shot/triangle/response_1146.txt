Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided.

The triangles in this graph are:
<3, 5, 7>
