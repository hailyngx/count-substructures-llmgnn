Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The unique triangles in this graph are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, and <4, 5, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
