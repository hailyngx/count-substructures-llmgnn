Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
The graph formed by these edges is as follows:
```
0 -- 1 -- 5
|    |    |
2    8 -- 6
     |    |
     4    3
```

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 8>, <1, 5, 6>

There are [2] triangles in total.
