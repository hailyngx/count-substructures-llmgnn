Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
