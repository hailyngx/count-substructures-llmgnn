Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows: 
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 8, 2>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 8, 3>, <3, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
