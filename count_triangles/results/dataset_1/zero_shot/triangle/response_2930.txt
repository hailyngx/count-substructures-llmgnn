Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. Here is the count and the unique triangles present in the graph:

[<0, 3, 4>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <5, 8, 9>]  
There are 4 triangles in total.  
Therefore, the answer is [4].
