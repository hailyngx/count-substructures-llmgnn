Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by summing up the number of triangles that each node participates in. To count the triangles in this graph, we will look at each node and its neighboring nodes to find triangles. 

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
[<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 7>]

The final answer is:
[6]
