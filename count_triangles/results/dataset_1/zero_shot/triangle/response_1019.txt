Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<2, 1, 7>
<2, 7, 5>
<2, 8, 7>
<2, 8, 3>
<2, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 1>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
<8, 6, 8>
<8, 7, 5>

There are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
