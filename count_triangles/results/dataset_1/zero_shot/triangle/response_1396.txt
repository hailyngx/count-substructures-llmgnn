Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<6, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
