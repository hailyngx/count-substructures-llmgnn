Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, and <5, 8, 9> triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
