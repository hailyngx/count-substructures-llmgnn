Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles: <1, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 7>.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
