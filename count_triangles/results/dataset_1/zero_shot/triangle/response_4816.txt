Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by finding all the unique combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges. 

Upon analyzing the given edges, the triangles present in the graph are:
<1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
