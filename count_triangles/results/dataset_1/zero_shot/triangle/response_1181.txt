Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
