Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 1 -- 2
|    |    |
4 -- 3    5
|    |
7 -- 6 -- 9
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are connected to each other.

The triangles in the graph are:
[<0, 1, 7>, <1, 3, 7>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
