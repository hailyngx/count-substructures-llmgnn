Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of paths of length 2 between nodes. Since we are given the edges, we can manually find the triangles.

Here are the triangles present in the given graph:
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 8, 4>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 7>
<7, 6, 4>

There are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph.  
Therefore, the answer is [11].
