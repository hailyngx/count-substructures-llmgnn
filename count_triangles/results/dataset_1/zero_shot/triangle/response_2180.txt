Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [12] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 0>, <6, 8, 9>, <8, 7, 2>, <8, 9, 5>.
