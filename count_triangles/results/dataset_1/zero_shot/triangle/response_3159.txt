Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by finding all the unique triangles using the given edge connections.

The unique triangles in the graph are:
<2, 8, 6>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 8, 1>
<2, 6, 0>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<8, 6, 0>
<8, 6, 3>
<8, 6, 7>
<6, 0, 7>
<6, 0, 2>
<6, 3, 9>
<6, 3, 1>
<6, 3, 2>
<6, 7, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
