Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <8, 7, 9>.
There are 7 triangles in total. Hence, the final answer is [7].
