Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 7>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
