Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the given graph are: 

<0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 9>

There are a total of [15] triangles in the graph.
