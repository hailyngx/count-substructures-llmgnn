Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 3, 2>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 1>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 8, 6>
<7, 8, 6>
<7, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 7>

So, the final answer is [14].
