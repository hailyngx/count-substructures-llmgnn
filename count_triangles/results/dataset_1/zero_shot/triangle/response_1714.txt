Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 9>.
    There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
