Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 6, 9>.
