Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by identifying the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Upon examining the given edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
