Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

These triangles are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 7, 6>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
