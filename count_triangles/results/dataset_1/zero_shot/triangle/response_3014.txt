Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

From the provided edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 2>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
4. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
5. Triangle <8, 9, 4>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
