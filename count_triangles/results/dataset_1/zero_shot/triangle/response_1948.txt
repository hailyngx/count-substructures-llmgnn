Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 7>.
