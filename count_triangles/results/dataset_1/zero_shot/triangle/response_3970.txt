Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
