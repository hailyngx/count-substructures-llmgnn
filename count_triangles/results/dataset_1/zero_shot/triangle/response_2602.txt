Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
