Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by examining the number of triangles each node is involved in. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other by edges. 

In this case, we can list the triangles by observing the connections between the nodes:

1. Triangle: <0, 4, 5>
2. Triangle: <0, 4, 7>
3. Triangle: <0, 4, 9>
4. Triangle: <0, 5, 6>
5. Triangle: <1, 3, 4>
6. Triangle: <1, 3, 8>
7. Triangle: <1, 7, 2>
8. Triangle: <2, 7, 4>
9. Triangle: <2, 7, 8>
10. Triangle: <2, 8, 3>
11. Triangle: <2, 9, 0>
12. Triangle: <2, 9, 6>
13. Triangle: <3, 4, 8>
14. Triangle: <4, 8, 1>
15. Triangle: <4, 8, 2>
16. Triangle: <4, 8, 3>
17. Triangle: <4, 9, 0>
18. Triangle: <5, 0, 6>
19. Triangle: <7, 1, 3>
20. Triangle: <7, 2, 8>
21. Triangle: <7, 4, 0>
22. Triangle: <8, 1, 7>
23. Triangle: <8, 2, 7>
24. Triangle: <8, 3, 4>
25. Triangle: <9, 0, 6>

Therefore, there are 25 triangles in the given graph. The answer is [25].
