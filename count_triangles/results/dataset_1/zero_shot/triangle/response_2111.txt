Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

The triangles formed are:
<0, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
