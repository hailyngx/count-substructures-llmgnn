Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of paths of length 2 between each unique pair of nodes.

To find the triangles in the given graph, let's consider each node as a potential triangle vertex and count the triangles that can be formed using that vertex.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
[<0, 2, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
