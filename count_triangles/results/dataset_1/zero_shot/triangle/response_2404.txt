Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
