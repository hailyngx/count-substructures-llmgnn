Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 8>.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
