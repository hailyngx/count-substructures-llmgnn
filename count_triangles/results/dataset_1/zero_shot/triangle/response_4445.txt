Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles present in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: 

<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 2>
<6, 2, 7>
<6, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
