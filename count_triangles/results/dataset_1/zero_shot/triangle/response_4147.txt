Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 9, 8>
<1, 0, 7>
<1, 0, 9>
<1, 7, 6>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 2, 6>
<3, 2, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 2, 5>
<5, 2, 4>
<6, 0, 7>
<6, 3, 7>
<6, 7, 0>
<7, 0, 6>
<7, 1, 6>
<8, 1, 9>
<8, 3, 9>
<9, 0, 8>
<9, 3, 8>

Therefore, there are 24 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [24].
