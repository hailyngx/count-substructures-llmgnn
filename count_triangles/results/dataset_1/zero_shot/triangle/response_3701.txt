Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<4, 5, 9>

There are a total of 7 triangles in the graph.
So, the answer is [7].
