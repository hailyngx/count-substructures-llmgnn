Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 7>]
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
