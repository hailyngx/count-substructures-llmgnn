Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the relationship between the number of triangles and the degrees of the nodes. In this case, we can manually count the triangles. Let's do that:

The triangles present in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [8].
