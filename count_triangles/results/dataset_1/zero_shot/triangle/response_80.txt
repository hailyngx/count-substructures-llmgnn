Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 2>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, and <7, 8, 9>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
