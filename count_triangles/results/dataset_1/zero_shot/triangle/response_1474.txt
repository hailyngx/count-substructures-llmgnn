Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here they are: 
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 1>, <5, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
