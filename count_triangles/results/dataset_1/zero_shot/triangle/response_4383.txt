Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

- <0, 6, 8>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <8, 7, 3>

Total number of triangles: [9]
