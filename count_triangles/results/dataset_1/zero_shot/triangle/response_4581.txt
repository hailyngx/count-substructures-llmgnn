Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
