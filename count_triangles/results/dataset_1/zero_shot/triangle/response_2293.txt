Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
    1 -- 5       7
   /|    |     /|
  0 |    |   6 |
   \|    |    \|
    8 -- 6       9
         |\
         | \
         |  \
         2   4
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will identify the unique triangles formed by nodes. 

After examining the graph, we find the following unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <6, 8, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
