Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<[0, 5, 1]> <[0, 5, 2]> <[0, 6, 4]> <[2, 5, 1]> <[2, 5, 6]> <[3, 8, 9]> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
