Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three nodes connected by edges. 

Upon examining the graph, here are the unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. 
The final answer is [10].
