Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

[<1, 9, 2>, <2, 9, 4>, <3, 1, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 2, 5>, <3, 7, 5>] 

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
