Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by looking for three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
5. Triangle <4, 6, 8>
6. Triangle <4, 6, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 8, 9>
8. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
