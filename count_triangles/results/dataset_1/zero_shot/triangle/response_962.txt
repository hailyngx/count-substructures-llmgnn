Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 0, 5>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 9, 6>
<1, 9, 7>
<2, 9, 6>
<7, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] triangles in the graph.
