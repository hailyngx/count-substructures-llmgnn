Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. Here, the triangles are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 1, 7>
4. <0, 4, 6>
5. <0, 4, 7>
6. <1, 4, 5>
7. <1, 4, 9>
8. <1, 5, 9>
9. <0, 6, 7>
10. <4, 6, 7>
11. <3, 5, 9>
12. <0, 6, 8>
13. <2, 6, 8>
14. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
