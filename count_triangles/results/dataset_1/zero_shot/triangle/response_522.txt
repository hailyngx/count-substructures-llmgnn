Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by determining the number of paths of length 2 between all possible pairs of nodes in the graph. Let's calculate this for the given graph:

The triangles in the graph are formed by the following unique sets of nodes:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
