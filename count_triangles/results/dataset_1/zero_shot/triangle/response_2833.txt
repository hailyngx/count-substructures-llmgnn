Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i} \text{degree}(v_i) \, (\text{degree}(v_i) - 1) \, (\text{degree}(v_i) - 2) \]

where the sum is taken over all vertices in the graph.

In this graph, we can calculate the number of triangles using the above formula. After calculation, I found that the number of triangles is 6. Here are the unique triangles in the graph:

\[ <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 8> \]

Therefore, the final answer is: [6].
