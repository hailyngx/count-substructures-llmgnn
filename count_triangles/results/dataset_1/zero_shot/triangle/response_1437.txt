Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 3>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 3>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
