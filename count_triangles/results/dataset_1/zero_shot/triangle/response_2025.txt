Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting all the unique triangles that can be formed. 

By analyzing the given edges, the unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in total.
