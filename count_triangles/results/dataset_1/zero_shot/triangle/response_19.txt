Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of closed paths of length 3. Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:

[<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 1, 7>, <4, 2, 7>, <5, 7, 8>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
