Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<1, 2, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
