Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by examining all possible combinations of three nodes. Since determining triangles manually can be time-consuming in this graph, we will use an alternative method that involves checking if any two nodes share a common neighbor.

By analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 2, 9>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 9, 5>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
