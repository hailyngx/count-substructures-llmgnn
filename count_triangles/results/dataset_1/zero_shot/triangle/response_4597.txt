Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 6. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, and <4, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the answer is [6].
