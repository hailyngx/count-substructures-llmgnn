Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<6, 1, 8>
<6, 2, 7>
<9, 0, 4>
<9, 0, 6>
<9, 6, 2>
<9, 8, 1>

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in total. Hence, the answer is [14].
