Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
