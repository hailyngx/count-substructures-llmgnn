Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [20].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 0, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 0, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 9, 5>
<4, 0, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 1, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 2, 5>
<8, 6, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
