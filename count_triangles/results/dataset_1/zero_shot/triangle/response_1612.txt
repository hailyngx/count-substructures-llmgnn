Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: 

<1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <8, 9, 7>, <8, 9, 2>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
