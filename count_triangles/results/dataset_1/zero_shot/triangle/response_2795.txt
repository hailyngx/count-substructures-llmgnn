Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 8, 3>
<6, 9, 0>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 2, 5>

There are 10 triangles in total. 
So, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
