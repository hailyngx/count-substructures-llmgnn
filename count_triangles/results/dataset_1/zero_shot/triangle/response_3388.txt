Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes that form a triangle. Since a triangle is formed by 3 nodes connected to each other, we need to find all unique combinations of 3 nodes that are connected in the graph.

After analyzing the edges given, we can identify the following triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 6, 7>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <1, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
