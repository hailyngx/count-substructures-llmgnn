Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all unique combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges. After analyzing the graph, the following unique triangles are found:

<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 1, 7>
<7, 1, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
