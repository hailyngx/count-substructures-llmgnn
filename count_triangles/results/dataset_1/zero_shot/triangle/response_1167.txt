Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in total. Hence, the answer is [9].
