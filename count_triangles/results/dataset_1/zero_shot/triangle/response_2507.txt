Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible unique triangles based on the given edges. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 1, 3>, <2, 1, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 1, 5>, <3, 1, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 6>, <5, 1, 3>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 1, 9>, <5, 3, 6>, <5, 3, 7>, <5, 3, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 5, 7>, <6, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 3, 5>, <7, 3, 6>, <7, 3, 8>, <7, 4, 6>, <7, 5, 6>, <7, 5, 8>, <7, 6, 9>, <7, 8, 4>, <7, 8, 3>, <8, 1, 2>, <8, 2, 3>, <8, 3, 7>, <8, 7, 5>, <9, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [41].
