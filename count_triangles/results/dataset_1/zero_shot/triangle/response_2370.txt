Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a given graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges is [18].

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<5, 4, 8>
<0, 9, 1>
<2, 6, 5>
<3, 5, 4>
<3, 8, 4>
<0, 9, 4>
<0, 7, 1>
<2, 6, 0>
<7, 4, 5>
<8, 9, 4>
<5, 6, 2>
<5, 7, 4>
<3, 8, 5>
<0, 6, 2>
<7, 5, 4>
<9, 0, 1>
<9, 8, 4>
<3, 4, 5> 

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
