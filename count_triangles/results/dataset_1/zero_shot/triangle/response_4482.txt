Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed in unique order:

<0, 7, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
