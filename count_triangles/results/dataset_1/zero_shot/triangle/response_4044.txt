Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets []:

[<0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>]
