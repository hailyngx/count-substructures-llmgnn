Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has 8 triangles. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 8, 5>

As requested, the final answer is [8].
