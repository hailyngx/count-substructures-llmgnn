Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.  
So, the final answer is [10].
