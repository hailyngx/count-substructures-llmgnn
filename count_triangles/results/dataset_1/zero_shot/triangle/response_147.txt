Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 5>
<5, 7, 9>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
