Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
