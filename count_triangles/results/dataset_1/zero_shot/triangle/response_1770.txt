Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are total of [42] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>.
