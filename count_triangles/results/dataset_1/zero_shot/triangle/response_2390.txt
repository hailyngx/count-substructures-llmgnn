Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 8, 6>
<5, 0, 8>
<6, 1, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 4, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
