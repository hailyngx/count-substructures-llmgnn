Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<1, 8, 4>
<1, 9, 6>
<1, 9, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<6, 7, 9>  

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
