Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets:

[<0, 2, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 6>, <3, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 0>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 9, 3>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 5, 7>, <8, 4, 7>, <8, 9, 3>]
