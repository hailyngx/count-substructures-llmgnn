Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph. 

The triangles are: 
<0, 1, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 9, 6>
<0, 9, 3>
<0, 7, 4>

Therefore, the answer is [6].
