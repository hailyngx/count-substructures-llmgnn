Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be calculated by identifying all the unique triangles formed by the given edges.

The triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
