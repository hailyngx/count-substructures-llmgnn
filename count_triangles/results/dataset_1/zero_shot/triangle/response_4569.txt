Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 8>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
