Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <1, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 6>.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the graph.
