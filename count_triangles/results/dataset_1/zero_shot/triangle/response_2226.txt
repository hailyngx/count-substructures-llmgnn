Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, and <7, 9, 0>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
