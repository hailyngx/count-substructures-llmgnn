Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:

<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 9, 3>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 6, 5>
<2, 5, 1>
<4, 7, 9>

Hence, there are [7] triangles in the graph.
