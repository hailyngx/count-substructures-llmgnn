Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
[<0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <6, 8, 9>]    
So, the final answer is [5].
