Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles: <1, 2, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>.
There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
