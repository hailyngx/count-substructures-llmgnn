Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 15 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 0, 4>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 0, 2>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 3, 5>, <4, 3, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 9>]
