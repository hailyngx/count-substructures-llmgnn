Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 4, 0>, and <4, 8, 9>.
