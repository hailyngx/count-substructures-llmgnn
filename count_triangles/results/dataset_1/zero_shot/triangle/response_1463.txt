Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles formed by the edges in the graph.

Calculating the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 2: <8, 4, 9>
- Triangle 3: <8, 5, 9>

There are a total of 3 triangles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
