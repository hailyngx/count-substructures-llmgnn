Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 3>
<3, 4, 9>
<6, 8, 4>
<6, 9, 4>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
