Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: 
<0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 1, 6>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 5, 6>, <5, 4, 7>, <5, 4, 8>, <5, 4, 7>, <5, 4, 8>, <6, 1, 5>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 2, 3>, <6, 2, 5>, <6, 3, 4>, <6, 3, 7>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 1, 8>, <4, 3, 7>, <4, 3, 9>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 7, 9>, <7, 0, 9>, <7, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [27].
