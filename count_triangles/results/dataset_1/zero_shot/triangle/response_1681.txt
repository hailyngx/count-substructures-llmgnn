Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be calculated using the number of triangles a node is part of. To count the triangles, we can observe the triangles present in the given graph.

The triangles in the graph are:  
<0, 2, 8>  
<1, 6, 9>  
<2, 8, 9>  
<3, 5, 9>  
<4, 6, 9>  
<5, 6, 9>  
<6, 7, 9>  
<7, 8, 9>  
<0, 2, 8>  

There are a total of 9 unique triangles in the graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
