Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 21 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 0, 6>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 2, 5>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 2, 3>
<4, 2, 6>
<5, 0, 7>
<5, 0, 8>
<6, 0, 7>
<6, 1, 0>
<7, 5, 8>
<8, 5, 7>
<0, 8, 9>
So, the final answer is [21].
