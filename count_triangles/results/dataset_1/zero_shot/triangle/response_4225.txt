Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as:
    
    0 -- 5 -- 1
     \   |   /
       4 -- 7
      /|   |\
    2 -- 6 -- 8
            |
            9

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all unique combinations of 3 nodes that are connected by edges to each other.

After carefully examining the graph, the following unique triangles are found:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 4>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 4>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 4>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 8, 7>
<6, 8, 5>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 5>
<8, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
