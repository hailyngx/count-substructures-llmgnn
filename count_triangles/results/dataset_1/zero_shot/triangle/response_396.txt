Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 7, 8>.

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
