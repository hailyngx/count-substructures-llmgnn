Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be determined by finding the number of triangles each node is part of and summing them up.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 1>

Counting each triangle only once, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
