Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
