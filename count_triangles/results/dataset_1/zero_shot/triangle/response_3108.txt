Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has 12 triangles.  

The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 6, 4>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 0>
<5, 6, 4>
<5, 8, 0>
<5, 8, 4>
<7, 0, 3>
<7, 3, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
