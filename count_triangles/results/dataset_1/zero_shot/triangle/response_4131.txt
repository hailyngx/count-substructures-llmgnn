Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph contains the following triangles: <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <1, 2, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
