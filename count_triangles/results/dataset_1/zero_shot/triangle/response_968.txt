Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by identifying and counting unique sets of three nodes that form a triangle. In this given graph, the triangles can be identified as follows:

1. <1, 4, 7>
2. <2, 4, 7>
3. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
