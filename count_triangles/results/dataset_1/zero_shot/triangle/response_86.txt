Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 6 triangles.

The triangles are:
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<0, 3, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
