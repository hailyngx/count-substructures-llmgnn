Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 0, 8>, <2, 1, 4>, and <2, 5, 9>. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
