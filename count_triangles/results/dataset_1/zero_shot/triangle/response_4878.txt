Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph. Here they are:

[<1, 2, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 3, 5>]
