Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:
```
0 --- 6
|\    |
| \   |
|  \  |
|   \ |
7    3
|     |
9 --- 1 --- 8
|     |    |
|     |    |
4     5    2
        \   
         3
```

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:

<1, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 6>

There are a total of 3 triangles in the given graph, hence the final answer is [3].
