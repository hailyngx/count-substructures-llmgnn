Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 3>
<6, 3, 9> 

There are 5 triangles in total. 
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
