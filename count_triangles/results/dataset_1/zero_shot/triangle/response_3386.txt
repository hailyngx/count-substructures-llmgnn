Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the unique combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges. Let's go ahead and find the number of triangles:

The unique triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<3, 2, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
