Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <5, 4, 0>, <6, 7, 9>.  
There are total of 7 triangles in the graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [7].
