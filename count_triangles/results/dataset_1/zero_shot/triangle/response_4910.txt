Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are: 

<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>  

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
