Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by identifying all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. 

There are [4] triangles in the graph, which are as follows: 
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
