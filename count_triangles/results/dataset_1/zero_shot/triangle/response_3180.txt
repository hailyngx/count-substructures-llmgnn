Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 7> [4]
