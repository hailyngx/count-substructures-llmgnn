Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<1, 2, 4>, <3, 1, 5>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 2, 1>, <4, 2, 7>, <8, 6, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
