Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 4>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 1>
<3, 4, 8>
<7, 5, 1>
<7, 6, 1>
<8, 9, 0>

There are 13 triangles in total. So, the final answer is [13].
