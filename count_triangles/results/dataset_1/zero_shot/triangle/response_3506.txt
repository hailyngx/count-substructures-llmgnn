Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique combinations of nodes that form triangles. Let's list out the triangles present in the graph:

<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<5, 7, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles, we get: [6].
