Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 20 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 9, 1>, <4, 9, 2>, <4, 9, 3>, <5, 6, 2>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 3>, <5, 7, 0>, <6, 7, 8>, <9, 3, 1>, <9, 3, 2>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
