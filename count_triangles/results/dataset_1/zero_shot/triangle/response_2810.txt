Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of and then dividing by 3 (since each triangle involves 3 nodes).

Let's list the unique triangles found in this graph:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in total. 
The final answer is: [4]
