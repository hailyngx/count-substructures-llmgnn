Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by every group of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 5, 8>
2. <0, 5, 2>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <0, 8, 3>
5. <1, 3, 5>
6. <2, 5, 9>
7. <3, 1, 6>
8. <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
