Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, and <8, 9, 4>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
