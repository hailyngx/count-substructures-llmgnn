Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the graph are as follows: <2, 7, 9> and <7, 8, 9>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 2.  
So, the answer is [2].
