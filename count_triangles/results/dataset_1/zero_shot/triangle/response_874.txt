Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 4, 6>
<5, 6, 9>
<8, 1, 9>
<8, 2, 3>
<8, 2, 9>
<9, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
