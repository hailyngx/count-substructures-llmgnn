Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. 

After examining the given edges, we can list the triangles as follows:
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 8, 5>
<3, 9, 2>
<6, 1, 7>
<7, 1, 6>
<7, 8, 2>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
