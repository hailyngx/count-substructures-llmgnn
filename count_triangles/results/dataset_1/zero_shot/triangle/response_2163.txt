Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
