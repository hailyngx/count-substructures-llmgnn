Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as: 

```
0 --- 3 --- 1 --- 4 --- 6
      |     |     |     |
      5 --- 2 --- 8     7
               |
               9
```

To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first identify the set of unique triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 1>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 3: <1, 3, 4>
- Triangle 4: <1, 3, 8>
- Triangle 5: <1, 4, 5>
- Triangle 6: <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle 7: <1, 8, 2>
- Triangle 8: <2, 5, 3>
- Triangle 9: <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle 10: <3, 4, 5>
- Triangle 11: <3, 4, 8>
- Triangle 12: <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle 13: <4, 5, 6>
- Triangle 14: <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle 15: <8, 1, 3>
- Triangle 16: <8, 1, 4>
- Triangle 17: <8, 1, 2>
- Triangle 18: <8, 2, 5>

There are 18 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [18].
