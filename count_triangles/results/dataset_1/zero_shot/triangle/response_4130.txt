Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The list of triangles found in the given graph is as follows:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 2>
<6, 7, 2>
<6, 8, 3>

There are total 16 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [16].
