Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 0, 4>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 6, 2>, <5, 0, 2>
There are a total of 8 triangles in the graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
