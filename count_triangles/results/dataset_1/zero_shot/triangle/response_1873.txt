Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <1, 4, 9>
4. <1, 6, 9>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <4, 6, 9>
7. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
