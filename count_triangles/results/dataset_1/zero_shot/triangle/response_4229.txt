Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are: 

<0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 4>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 5>, <2, 5, 3>, <3, 5, 6>, <7, 2, 5>, <7, 4, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <4, 1, 6>, <9, 6, 5>, <9, 8, 3> 

There are a total of [15] triangles in the graph.
