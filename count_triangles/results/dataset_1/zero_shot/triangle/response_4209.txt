Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The list of triangles in this graph are as follows:
- <0, 6, 7>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total in this graph. [10]
