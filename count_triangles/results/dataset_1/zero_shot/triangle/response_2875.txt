Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 7, 6>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in total.
