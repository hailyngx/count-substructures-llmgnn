Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 14 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:

<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 0, 9>
<1, 9, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 7, 4>
<3, 2, 8>
<4, 0, 7>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 9, 5>
<7, 2, 4>
<7, 4, 9>
<9, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
