Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Number of Triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i} (deg(i))^2 - 2 \times \text{Number of Triangles} \]

where \( \text{deg(i)} \) represents the degree of node i.

Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

Degree of each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 2

Now, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the total number of triangles:

\[ \text{Number of Triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \left(6^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 + 2^2 + 2^2\right) - 2 \times \text{Number of Triangles} \]
\[ \text{Number of Triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \left(36 + 4 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 25 + 4 + 4\right) - 2 \times \text{Number of Triangles} \]
\[ \text{Number of Triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \times 130 - 2 \times \text{Number of Triangles} \]
\[ \text{Number of Triangles} = 21.67 - 2 \times \text{Number of Triangles} \]

Solving for Number of Triangles:
\[ 3 \times \text{Number of Triangles} = 21.67 \]
\[ \text{Number of Triangles} = 7.22 \]

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is approximately 7.22. The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 7, 9>.

So, the final answer is approximately [7].
