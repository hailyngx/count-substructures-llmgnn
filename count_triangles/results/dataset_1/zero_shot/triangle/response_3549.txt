Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows: 

```plaintext
        0 -- 8       2
        |     |      | \
        9 -- 1 -- 3-- 6 --5
                |      | /
               7 -- 4
```

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other such that there is an edge between every pair of nodes in the triangle.

After analyzing the graph, the triangles that can be found are:
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 6, 9>

There are **6** triangles in total. So, the answer is: **[6]**.
