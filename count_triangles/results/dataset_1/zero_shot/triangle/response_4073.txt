Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After analyzing the given graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 7, 8>, <3, 1, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
