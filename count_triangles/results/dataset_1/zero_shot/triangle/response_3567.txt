Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is [4]. 

The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, and <2, 4, 8>.
