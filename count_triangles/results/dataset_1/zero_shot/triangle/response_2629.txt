Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated using the formula:  

\[
\text{{Number of triangles}} = \frac{{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(d_i^2 - \text{{number of edges incident on node i}})}}{2}
\]

where \(n\) is the number of nodes, and \(d_i\) is the degree of node \(i\).

Given that this graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges, the calculation results in 20 triangles.  

The unique triangles are:

\[<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <7, 8, 9>\]

Therefore, there are a total of 20 triangles in this graph.  
The final answer is: [20]
