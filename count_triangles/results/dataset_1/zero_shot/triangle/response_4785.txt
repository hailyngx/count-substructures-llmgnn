Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 4>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 0, 5>
<4, 3, 7>
<7, 4, 8>
<7, 4, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
