Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by examining each possible triangle formation in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other by edges.

After checking all possible combinations of three connected nodes, the unique triangles in the given graph are:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
