Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles found in the given graph are as follows: 

<1, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in total.
