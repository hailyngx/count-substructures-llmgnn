Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we will check every possible triangle formed by connecting three nodes. 

There are three criteria for a triangle:
1. It consists of three connected nodes.
2. Each node is connected to the other two nodes in the triangle.
3. It does not share multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.

Let's calculate the number of triangles:

1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 3, 8>
4. <0, 3, 8>
5. <1, 5, 9>
6. <2, 5, 6>
7. <2, 5, 6>
8. <2, 5, 6>
9. <3, 5, 7>
10. <3, 5, 7>
11. <3, 5, 7>
12. <3, 5, 7>
13. <6, 8, 9>
14. <6, 8, 9>
15. <6, 8, 9>
16. <6, 8, 9>
17. <6, 8, 9>
18. <6, 8, 9>
19. <7, 9, 6>
20. <7, 9, 6>
21. <7, 9, 6>
22. <7, 9, 6>
23. <7, 9, 6>
24. <7, 9, 6>
25. <7, 9, 6>
26. <7, 9, 6>
27. <7, 9, 6>
28. <7, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [28].
