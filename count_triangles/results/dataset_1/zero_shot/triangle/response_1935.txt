Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 2>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 9, 4>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<8, 5, 4>
<8, 6, 0>
<8, 7, 2>

There are 11 unique triangles in total. Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [11].
