Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 6>, <4, 6, 8>

There are a total of [6] triangles in this graph.
