Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 4>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the graph.  
The answer is: [6]
