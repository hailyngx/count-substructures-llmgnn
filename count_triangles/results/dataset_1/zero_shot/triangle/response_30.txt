Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
    1 --- 5       6
   /       \     /
  2 ------- 0 -- 7
   \       / \   |
    3 --- 4   8  |
               \ |
                9
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that form a triangle. 

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <2, 4, 3>
3. <2, 1, 5>
4. <7, 6, 9>
5. <7, 8, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
