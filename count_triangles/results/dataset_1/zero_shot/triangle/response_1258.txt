Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be determined by checking for each triplet of nodes whether there are edges connecting all three nodes. Let's go ahead and calculate the number of triangles in this graph.

Looking at the given graph, the unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Thus, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
