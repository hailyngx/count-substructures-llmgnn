Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<2, 3, 7>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
