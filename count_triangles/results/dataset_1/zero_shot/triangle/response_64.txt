Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles formed by the nodes.

By examining the given edges, the unique triangles in the graph are:

<0, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 1>
<2, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<4, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
