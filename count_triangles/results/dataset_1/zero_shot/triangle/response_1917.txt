Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>

Counting all the unique triangles, we have a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
