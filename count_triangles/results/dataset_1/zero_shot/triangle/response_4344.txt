Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Calculating the number of triangles may be done in various ways. Here is one way to visually represent the triangles:

0: [1, 4, 8]  
1: [0, 3, 7]  
2: [9]   
3: [1, 9]  
4: [0]   
5: [9]  
7: [1]  
8: [0]  
9: [2, 3, 5]  

By examining the connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 1, 7>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<0, 4, 8>  
<1, 3, 9>  
<9, 5, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
