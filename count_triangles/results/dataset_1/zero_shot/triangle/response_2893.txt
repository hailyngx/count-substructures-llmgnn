Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Taking a look at the given graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <2, 6, 9>
4. <2, 7, 4>
5. <2, 7, 8>
6. <4, 5, 9>
7. <4, 7, 2>
8. <5, 0, 4>
9. <6, 2, 9>
10. <9, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
