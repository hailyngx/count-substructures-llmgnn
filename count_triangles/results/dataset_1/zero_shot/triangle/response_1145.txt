Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 2>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
