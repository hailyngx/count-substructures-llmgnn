Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

[<0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 8, 5>, <6, 8, 9>]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the graph. 
The final answer is [4].
