Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<3, 8, 9>

So, the final answer is [9].
