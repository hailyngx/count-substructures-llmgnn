Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: <0, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 7>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
