Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 1>
<2, 9, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
