Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles are <0, 1, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, and <7, 8, 9>.
