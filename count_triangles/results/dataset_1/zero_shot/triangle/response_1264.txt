Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 9, 4>, <8, 9, 0>, <8, 9, 4>, <9, 4, 6>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
