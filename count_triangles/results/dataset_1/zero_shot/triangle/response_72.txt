Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles found:

- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 7, 5>
- <6, 0, 8>
- <6, 3, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [12].
