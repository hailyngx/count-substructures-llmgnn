Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by examining all possible triangles formed by the nodes and edges. 

First, let's list out all possible unique triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 9, 4>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<8, 6, 0>
<8, 6, 7>
<8, 6, 9>
<8, 7, 9>
<9, 1, 2>
<9, 1, 5>
<9, 2, 5>
<9, 5, 6>
<9, 5, 7>

Now, we count the number of triangles using the given edges:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<8, 6, 0>
<8, 6, 7>
<8, 6, 9>
<8, 7, 9>
<9, 1, 2>
<9, 2, 5>
<9, 5, 6>
<9, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
