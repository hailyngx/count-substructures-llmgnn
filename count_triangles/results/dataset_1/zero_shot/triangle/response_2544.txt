Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node participates in and summing them up.

Upon analyzing the given graph, we find the following triangles:
<1, 0, 2>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in total. [<1 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 29>]
