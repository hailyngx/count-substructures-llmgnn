Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles using the given edges. 

After counting the triangles, we find that there are 14 triangles in the graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [14]. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.
