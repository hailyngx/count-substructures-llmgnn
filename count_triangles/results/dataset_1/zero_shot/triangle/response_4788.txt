Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
