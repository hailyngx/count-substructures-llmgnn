Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 7, 1>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 3>

There are a total of 10 unique triangles in the graph.
Therefore, the answer is [10].
