Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>]
