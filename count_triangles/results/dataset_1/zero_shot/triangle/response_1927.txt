Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   0 --- 1 --- 8 --- 9
   |       |     |   
   |       |     |   
   9       4 --- 3
           |     |
           |     |
           8 --- 7 --- 5
               |
               |    
               6
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After examining the graph, we find that there are 4 triangles in the graph. The triangles are:
1. <1, 4, 8>
2. <4, 6, 8>
3. <4, 7, 8>
4. <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
