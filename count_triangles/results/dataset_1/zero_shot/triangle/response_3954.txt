Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all possible triangles that can be formed using the given edges. 

Checking each group of 3 nodes for potential triangles:
1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 1, 5: Not possible as edge (1,5) is missing.
2. Triangle involving nodes 0, 1, 6: Not possible as edge (1,6) is missing.
3. Triangle involving nodes 0, 2, 8: Not possible as edge (0,2) is missing.
4. Triangle involving nodes 0, 5, 6: Forms a triangle as all edges (0,5), (5,6), and (0,6) are present. <0, 5, 6>
5. Triangle involving nodes 0, 6, 8: Forms a triangle as all edges (0,6), (6,8), and (0,8) are present. <0, 6, 8>
6. Triangle involving nodes 1, 6, 8: Not possible as edge (1,6) is missing.
7. Triangle involving nodes 2, 6, 8: Not possible as edge (2,6) is missing.
8. Triangle involving nodes 3, 7, 8: Not possible as edge (3,7) is missing.
9. Triangle involving nodes 6, 7, 8: Forms a triangle as all edges (6,7), (7,8), and (6,8) are present. <6, 7, 8>
10. Triangle involving nodes 7, 8, 9: Not possible as edge (8,9) is missing.

Therefore, there are 3 unique triangles in the given graph, which are: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 8>.

Hence, the final answer is [3].
