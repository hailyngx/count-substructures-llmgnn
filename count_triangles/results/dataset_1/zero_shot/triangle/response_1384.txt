Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <1, 2, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 9>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
