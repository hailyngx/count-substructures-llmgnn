Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be determined by examining all possible sets of three nodes that form a triangle. 

After analyzing the given graph, the unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, and <4, 5, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
