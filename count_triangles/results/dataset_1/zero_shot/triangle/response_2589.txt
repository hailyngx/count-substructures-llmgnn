Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<1, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
