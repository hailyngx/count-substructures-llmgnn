Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 5>, <7, 8, 9>.
