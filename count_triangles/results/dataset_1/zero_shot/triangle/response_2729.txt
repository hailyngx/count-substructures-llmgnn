Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [7] triangles in the given graph:

[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>]
