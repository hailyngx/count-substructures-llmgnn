Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 18 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 1, 6>, <5, 0, 6>, <5, 1, 6>, <6, 0, 5>, <6, 0, 8>, <6, 1, 8>, <6, 2, 8>, <6, 3, 7>, <8, 1, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
