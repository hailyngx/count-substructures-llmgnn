Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:

<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 9, 7>
<4, 9, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
