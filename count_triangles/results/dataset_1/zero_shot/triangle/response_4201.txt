Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph given has the following triangles: 

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 6, 3>
<1, 5, 1>
<3, 7, 2>
<3, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 3>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
