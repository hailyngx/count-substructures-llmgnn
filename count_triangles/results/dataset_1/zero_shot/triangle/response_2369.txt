Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique paths of length 2 between nodes. 

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [9].
