Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
