Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges to each other. 

Upon manual calculation, the triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 9, 1>
<4, 7, 1>
<1, 9, 3>
<7, 9, 1>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
