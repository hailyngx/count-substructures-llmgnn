Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 9>

There are 4 triangles in total. So, the final answer is [4].
