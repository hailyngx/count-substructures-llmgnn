Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of paths of length 2 between all possible pairs of nodes. In this case, we can find the triangles by identifying nodes that are connected by two edges through a common neighbor.

Let's list the triangles found in this graph:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 8, 7>
<3, 8, 5>
<3, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
