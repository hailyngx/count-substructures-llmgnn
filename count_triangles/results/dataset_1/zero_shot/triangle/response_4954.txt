Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can form the following triangles:
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 3>
<1, 9, 5>
<3, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph.
