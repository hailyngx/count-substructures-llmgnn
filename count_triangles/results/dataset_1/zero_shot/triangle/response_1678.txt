Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are connected to each other. 

By observing the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
