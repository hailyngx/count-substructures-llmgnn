Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 4, 3>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<6, 2, 1>
<8, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the graph. Hence, the final answer is [5].
