Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 14 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:

<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 9, 2>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 3>
<5, 9, 0>

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
