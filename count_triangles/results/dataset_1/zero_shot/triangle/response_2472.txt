Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<1, 2, 4>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 9, 5>
<2, 1, 5>
<5, 6, 0>
<6, 7, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
