Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in this graph. 

There are 3 unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 3>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 9, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
