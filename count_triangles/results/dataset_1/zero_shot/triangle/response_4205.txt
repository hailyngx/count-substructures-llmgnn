Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

In this graph, the triangles can be formed by the following sets of nodes:
- Triangle 1: <0, 7, 9>
- Triangle 2: <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
