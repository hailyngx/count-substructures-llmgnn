Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 2>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <8, 6, 7>, <8, 6, 5>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 5, 4>, <2, 7, 8>, <5, 9, 0>.
