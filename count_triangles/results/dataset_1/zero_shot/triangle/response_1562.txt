Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be formed by finding nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list them out:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Count of triangles: [10]
