Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 -- 1 -- 2
    |         |
    5         4
    |         |
    3 -- 6 -- 8
         |
         7
```

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to consider every set of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's list them:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle 2: <1, 2, 4>
3. Triangle 3: <1, 3, 5>
4. Triangle 4: <1, 4, 6>
5. Triangle 5: <2, 4, 8>
6. Triangle 6: <3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the graph contains a total of 6 triangles. So, the final answer is [6].
