Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 21 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 6>, <7, 8, 9>. The final answer is [21].
