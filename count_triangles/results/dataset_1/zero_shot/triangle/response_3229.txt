Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <7, 4, 9>.
    
    There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
