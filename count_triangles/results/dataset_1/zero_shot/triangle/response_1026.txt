Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting all the unique combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges.

By examining the edges, we can find the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <1, 3, 6>
5. <2, 3, 6>
6. <3, 5, 6>
7. <3, 8, 9>
8. <4, 8, 9>
9. <5, 6, 8>
10. <8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
