Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<[0, 1, 5]>
<[0, 1, 9]>
<[1, 0, 5]>
<[1, 0, 9]>
<[1, 5, 9]>
<[2, 3, 4]>
<[5, 0, 9]>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
