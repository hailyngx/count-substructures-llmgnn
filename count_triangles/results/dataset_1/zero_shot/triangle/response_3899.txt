Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, and <0, 9, 5>. 
Therefore, there are 3 triangles in total. 
So, the answer is [3].
