Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in total. [11]
