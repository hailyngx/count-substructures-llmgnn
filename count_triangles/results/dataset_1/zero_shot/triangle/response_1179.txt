Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible sets of three nodes that are interconnected to each other. We will then check if there are edges connecting all of them, forming a triangle.

After analyzing the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, the unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
