Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, and <2, 4, 9>.

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
