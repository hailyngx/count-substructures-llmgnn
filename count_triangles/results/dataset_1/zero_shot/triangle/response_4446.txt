Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the graph.
