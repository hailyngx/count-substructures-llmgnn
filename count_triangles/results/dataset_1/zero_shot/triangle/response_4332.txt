Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes with the following edges:
- 0: 1, 4
- 1: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- 2: 1, 3, 8
- 3: 2, 6, 7
- 4: 0, 1, 7
- 5: 8
- 6: 3, 9
- 7: 1, 3, 4
- 8: 1, 2, 5
- 9: 1, 6

Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

<0, 1, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 7>

There are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
