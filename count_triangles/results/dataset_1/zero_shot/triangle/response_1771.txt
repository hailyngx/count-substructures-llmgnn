Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is [6].  
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 0>, and <8, 9, 6>.
