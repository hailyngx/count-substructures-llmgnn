Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (d_i)^2 - \sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i^2 \]
where:
- \(d_i\) is the degree of node \(i\),
- \(e_i\) is the number of edges starting at node \(i\), and
- \(n\) is the total number of nodes.

Given the graph information provided, we can calculate the number of triangles as follows:

\[
d_0 = 3, \quad d_1 = 1, \quad d_2 = 6, \quad d_3 = 2, \quad d_4 = 4, \quad d_5 = 2, \quad d_6 = 4, \quad d_7 = 6, \quad d_8 = 4, \quad d_9 = 4
\]

\[
e_0 = 3, \quad e_1 = 1, \quad e_2 = 5, \quad e_3 = 2, \quad e_4 = 4, \quad e_5 = 2, \quad e_6 = 4, \quad e_7 = 6, \quad e_8 = 4, \quad e_9 = 4
\]

Now, plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{3} \left(3^2 + 1^2 + 6^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 4^2 + 4^2\right) - \left(3^2 + 1^2 + 5^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 4^2 + 4^2\right)
\]

\[
\text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{3} \left(131\right) - \left(91\right) = 14
\]

Therefore, there are a total of 14 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <9, 4, 6>.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
