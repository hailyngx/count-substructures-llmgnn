Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by connecting the nodes via edges. 

After analyzing the graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
