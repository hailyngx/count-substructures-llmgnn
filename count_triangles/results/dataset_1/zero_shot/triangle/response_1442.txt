Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 2, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
