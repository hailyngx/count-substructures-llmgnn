Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by finding how many sets of three nodes share connections with each other.

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 9>  

Count of triangles: [4]
