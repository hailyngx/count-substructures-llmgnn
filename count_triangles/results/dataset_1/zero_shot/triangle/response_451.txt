Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be determined by looking at the number of triangles each node participates in. Specifically, a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected in a closed loop.

Let's calculate the number of triangles:
- Node 0: Participates in 1 triangle <0, 5, 8>
- Node 1: Participates in 0 triangles
- Node 2: Participates in 0 triangles
- Node 3: Participates in 1 triangle <3, 5, 7>
- Node 4: Participates in 0 triangles
- Node 5: Participates in 3 triangles <0, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>
- Node 6: Participates in 1 triangle <0, 6, 8>
- Node 7: Participates in 1 triangle <1, 7, 3>
- Node 8: Participates in 1 triangle <2, 8, 5>
- Node 9: Participates in 1 triangle <0, 9, 2>

Total number of triangles = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
