Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 9, 4> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
