Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
