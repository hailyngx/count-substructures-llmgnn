Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 7, 9>]
