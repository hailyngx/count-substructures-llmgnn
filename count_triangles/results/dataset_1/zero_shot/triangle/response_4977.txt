Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for triplets of nodes that are mutually connected. 

Analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
- Triangle 1: <2, 7, 8>
- Triangle 2: <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 8, 7>
- Triangle 4: <7, 8, 2>
- Triangle 5: <6, 9, 2>
- Triangle 6: <9, 6, 2>

Hence, there are 6 triangles in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [6]
