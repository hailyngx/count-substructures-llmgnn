Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is [2].

The unique triangles are <1, 2, 8> and <6, 9, 0>.
