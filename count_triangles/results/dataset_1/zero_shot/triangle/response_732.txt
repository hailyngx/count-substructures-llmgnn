Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes and edges provided.

The triangles found in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
