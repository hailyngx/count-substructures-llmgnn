Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:  
<1, 7, 9>  
<2, 1, 9>  
<3, 5, 9>  
<3, 7, 9>  
<4, 7, 9>  

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the graph.
