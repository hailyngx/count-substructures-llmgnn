Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 1>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>
There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
