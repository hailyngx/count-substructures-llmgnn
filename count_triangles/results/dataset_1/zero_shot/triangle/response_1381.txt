Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <0,6,8>, <1,5,6>, <1,6,9>, <2,4,9>, <4,9,1>, <4,9,2>. 
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
