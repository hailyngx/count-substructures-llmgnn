Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph would be [4].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, and <2, 4, 8>.
