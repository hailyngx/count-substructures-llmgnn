Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph. Here they are listed inside brackets []:
[<0, 3, 7>, <0, 6, 2>, <3, 9, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 8, 5>, <9, 7, 3>]
