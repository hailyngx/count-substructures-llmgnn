Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 9, 8>, <6, 9, 7> triangles in the given graph. So the total number of triangles is 12.  
The answer is [12].
