Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, and <4, 5, 8>.
