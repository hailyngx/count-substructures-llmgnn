Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles:
[<0, 2, 3>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 5>, <8, 9, 8>]  
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
