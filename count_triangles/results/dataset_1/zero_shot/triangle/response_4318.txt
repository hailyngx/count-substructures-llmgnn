Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <1, 7, 6>
5. <3, 4, 2>
6. <3, 6, 2>
7. <3, 6, 7>
8. <3, 9, 0>
9. <9, 5, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
