Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 7, 8>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
