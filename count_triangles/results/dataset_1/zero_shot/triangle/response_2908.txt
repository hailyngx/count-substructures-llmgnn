Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [44].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is [44].
