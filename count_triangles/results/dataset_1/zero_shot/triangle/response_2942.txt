Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 6, 0>, <3, 1, 5>, <5, 4, 1>, <5, 7, 9>  

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
