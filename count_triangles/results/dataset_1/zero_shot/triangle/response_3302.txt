Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 5, 3>
<2, 4, 2>
<2, 5, 3>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 9, 6>
<8, 2, 4>
<8, 2, 5>
<8, 9, 6>
<9, 3, 5>
<9, 6, 5>
<9, 8, 9>

There are 12 triangles in total.  
Therefore, the final answer is [12].
