Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [15] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 1>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 8, 5>, <3, 8, 7>, <7, 8, 9>.
