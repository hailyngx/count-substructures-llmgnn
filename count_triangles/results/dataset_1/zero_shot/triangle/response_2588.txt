Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <1, 2, 4>
4. <2, 6, 7>
5. <3, 4, 9>

Thus, there are a total of 5 triangles in the graph. [5]
