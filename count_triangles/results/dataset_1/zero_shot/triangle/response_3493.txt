Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<4, 8, 9>

So, the final answer is [4].
