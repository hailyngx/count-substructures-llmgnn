Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a simple graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles formed by every triplet of nodes.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<8, 9, 2>
<8, 9, 5>

The number of unique triangles found above is 15, thus the final answer is [15].
