Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 4.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 6, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
