Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
