Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that form a triangle.

Upon examining the graph, we can see the following triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 7.
