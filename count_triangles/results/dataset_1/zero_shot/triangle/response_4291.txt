Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are four triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles: <0, 7, 3>, <2, 8, 4>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 3>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
