Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph is calculated by finding the number of unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

For the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges:

The triangles formed in this graph are:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
