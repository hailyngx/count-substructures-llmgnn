Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<6, 4, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

So, there are a total of 9 triangles in the graph. Hence, the final answer is [9].
