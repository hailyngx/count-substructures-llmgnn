Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<8, 6, 9>

There are a total of 10 triangles in the graph.
