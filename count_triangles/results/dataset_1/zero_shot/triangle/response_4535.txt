Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles formed by connecting three nodes.

By examining the list of edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 2>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 8, 1>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 9, 5>
<3, 2, 4>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 6>
<7, 5, 8>
<7, 6, 5>
<8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
