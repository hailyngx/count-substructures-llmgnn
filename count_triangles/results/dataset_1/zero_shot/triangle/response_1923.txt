Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:
<0, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
