Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
