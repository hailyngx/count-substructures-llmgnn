Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<9, 6, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
