Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in this graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
[<0, 4, 5>, <2, 6, 5>, <3, 8, 9>] 
So, the final answer is [3].
