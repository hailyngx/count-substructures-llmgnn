Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<2, 5, 6>
<6, 3, 8>
<6, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
