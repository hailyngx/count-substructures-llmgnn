Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <9, 3, 1>]  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
