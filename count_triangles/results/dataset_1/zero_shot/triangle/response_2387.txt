Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 9, 3>.
