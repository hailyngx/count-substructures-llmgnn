Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <3, 8, 9>.
    
    Therefore, there are [4] triangles in total in the given graph.
