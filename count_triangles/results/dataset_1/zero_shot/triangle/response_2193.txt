Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by looking at each possible triplet of nodes and checking if they form a triangle. Here is the list of unique triangles found in this graph:

<0, 3, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [8].
