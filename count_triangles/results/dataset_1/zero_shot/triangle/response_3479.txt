Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 6, 1>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
