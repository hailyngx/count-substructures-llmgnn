Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

[<1, 7, 9>] [<1, 2, 8>] [<1, 8, 9>] [<2, 5, 8>] [<5, 6, 9>] [<7, 6, 9>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 6.  
The final answer is [6].
