Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 8, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
