Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
    0 -- 5 -- 2
    |         |
    6         3 -- 8
              |
              7
```

Based on this graph, the number of triangles can be counted as follows:

- Triangle 1: <0, 5, 2>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [2].
