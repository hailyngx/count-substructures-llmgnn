Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by identifying all possible triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. 

After examining all the edges given, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 9, 4>
<3, 5, 8>
<7, 1, 8>
<7, 2, 8>
<8, 7, 2>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [10].
