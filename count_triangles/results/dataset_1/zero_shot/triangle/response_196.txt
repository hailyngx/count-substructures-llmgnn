Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes and edges provided.

Counting the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 4: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 5: <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle 6: <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle 7: <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle 8: <4, 5, 6>
- Triangle 9: <5, 7, 8>
- Triangle 10: <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
