Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 2>, <1, 5, 2>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 5>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 9, 7>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in total.  
The final answer is [9].
