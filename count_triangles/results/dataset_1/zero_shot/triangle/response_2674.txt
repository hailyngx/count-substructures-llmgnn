Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are <2, 8, 3>, <2, 9, 2>, <2, 5, 7>, and <3, 4, 0>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
