Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 2>
<1, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<4, 7, 1>
<3, 8, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
