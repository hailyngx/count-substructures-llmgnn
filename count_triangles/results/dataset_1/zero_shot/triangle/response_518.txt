Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] triangles in the given graph, which are <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 1>, <1, 6, 4>, and <8, 9, 2>.
