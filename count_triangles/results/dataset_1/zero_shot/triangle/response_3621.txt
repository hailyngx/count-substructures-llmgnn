Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:
<[1, 4, 7], [2, 6, 7], [4, 6, 7], [8, 9, 0]>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
