Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The unique triangles found in the given graph are: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 8>.  
There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph.  
Therefore, the answer is [4].
