Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:

<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<0, 8, 9>
<6, 4, 7>
<6, 4, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 2>
<7, 9, 8>

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
