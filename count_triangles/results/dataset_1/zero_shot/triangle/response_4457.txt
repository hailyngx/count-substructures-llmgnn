Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
