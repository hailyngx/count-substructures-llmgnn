Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of and then dividing by 3 since each triangle is counted 3 times (once for each node).

Calculating the number of triangles for each node:
- Node 0 is part of 2 triangles: <0, 2, 6> and <0, 2, 9>
- Node 1 is part of 0 triangles
- Node 2 is part of 7 triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, and <2, 8, 4>
- Node 3 is part of 0 triangles
- Node 4 is part of 1 triangle: <4, 6, 8>
- Node 5 is part of 0 triangles
- Node 6 is part of 6 triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 4>, <6, 7, 2>, <6, 7, 8>, and <6, 8, 2>
- Node 7 is part of 1 triangle: <2, 7, 8>
- Node 8 is part of 3 triangles: <2, 8, 4>, <4, 6, 8>, and <6, 7, 8>
- Node 9 is part of 0 triangles

To calculate the total number of triangles, we sum the number of triangles each node is part of: 2 + 0 + 7 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 6 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 20

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 8, 4>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 4>, <6, 7, 2>, <6, 7, 8>, and <6, 8, 2>.
