Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 4. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, and <2, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
