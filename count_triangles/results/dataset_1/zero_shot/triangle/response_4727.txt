Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <6, 8, 9> 

So, the final answer is [14].
