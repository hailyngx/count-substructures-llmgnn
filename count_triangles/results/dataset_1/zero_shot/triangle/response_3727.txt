Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 23 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<0, 8, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 3>
<2, 6, 8>
<0, 8, 1>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 6, 5>
<0, 8, 2>
<1, 6, 3>

So, the final answer is [23].
