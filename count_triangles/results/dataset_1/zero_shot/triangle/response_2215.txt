Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 2>
<4, 6, 3>
<5, 7, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
