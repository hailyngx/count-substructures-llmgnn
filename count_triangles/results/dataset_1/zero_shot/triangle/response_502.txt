Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, and <2, 3, 9>.
