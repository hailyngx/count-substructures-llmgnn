Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <2, 6, 7>.
