Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node participates in and dividing by 3 (since each triangle involves 3 nodes). Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

Node 0 participates in 0 triangle.
Node 1 participates in 3 triangles: <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 8>.
Node 2 participates in 6 triangles: <2, 1, 5>, <2, 1, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 7>.
Node 3 participates in 9 triangles: <3, 0, 4>, <3, 0, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 1, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>.
Node 4 participates in 9 triangles: <4, 0, 6>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 0, 3>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 3, 7>, <4, 3, 8>.
Node 5 participates in 6 triangles: <5, 1, 8>, <5, 2, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 1, 2>, <5, 1, 9>, <5, 2, 1>.
Node 6 participates in 3 triangles: <6, 2, 7>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 4, 9>.
Node 7 participates in 6 triangles: <7, 3, 4>, <7, 2, 9>, <7, 3, 9>, <7, 2, 6>, <7, 3, 8>, <7, 6, 9>.
Node 8 participates in 6 triangles: <8, 1, 5>, <8, 3, 9>, <8, 5, 9>, <8, 1, 2>, <8, 1, 3>, <8, 3, 4>.
Node 9 participates in 3 triangles: <9, 2, 6>, <9, 2, 5>, <9, 3, 4>.

Adding all the triangles each node participates in, we get a total of 3 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 6 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 3 = 45.
Dividing by 3, the total number of triangles in the graph is 45 / 3 = 15.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
