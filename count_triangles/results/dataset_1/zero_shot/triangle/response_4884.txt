Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
[<1, 2, 5>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 1>, <2, 9, 6>, <2, 9, 4>, <5, 2, 1>, <6, 2, 9>, <6, 9, 2>, <9, 2, 6>]

There are 9 unique triangles in total. 
Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
