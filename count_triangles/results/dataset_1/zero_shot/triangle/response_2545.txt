Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 5, 9>  
<1, 5, 8>
