Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 0>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <6, 8, 7>

Counting all unique triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
