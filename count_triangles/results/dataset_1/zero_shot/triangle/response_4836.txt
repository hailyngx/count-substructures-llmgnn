Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has multiple triangles. Let's identify and count them.

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<6, 8, 9>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
