Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [3] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 4>, <2, 6, 9>, and <0, 5, 7>.
