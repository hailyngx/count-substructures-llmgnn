Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 -- 2
   /|     |\
  / |     | \
 0  3     8  9
 |  |     | /
 4-- 7--5--/
```

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <1, 2, 8>
2. <1, 8, 9>
3. <1, 3, 5>
4. <1, 5, 8>
5. <2, 1, 8>
6. <3, 1, 5>
7. <5, 1, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [7].
