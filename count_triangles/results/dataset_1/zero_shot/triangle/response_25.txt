Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles found:
[<0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <8, 4, 6>]
