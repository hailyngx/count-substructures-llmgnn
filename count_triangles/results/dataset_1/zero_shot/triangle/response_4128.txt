Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
   - They are: <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>.
   
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
