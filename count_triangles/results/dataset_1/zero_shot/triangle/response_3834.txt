Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the graph.  
So, the final answer is [5].
