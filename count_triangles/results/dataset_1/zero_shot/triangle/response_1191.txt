Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following unique triangles:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 9, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 9, 8>, <8, 9, 7>, <8, 9, 7>, <8, 9, 6>, <8, 9, 7>

Total number of triangles: [18]
