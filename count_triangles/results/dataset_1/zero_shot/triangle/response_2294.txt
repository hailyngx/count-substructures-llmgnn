Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{{Number of triangles}} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_v \text{{deg}}(v) (\text{{deg}}(v) - 1) (\text{{deg}}(v) - 2) \]

Where:
- \( \text{{deg}}(v) \) is the degree of vertex \( v \).

Applying this formula to the given graph, we find:
\[ \text{{Number of triangles}} = \frac{1}{6} \left( 4(4-1)(4-2) + 5(4)(4-1) + 6(3)(3-1) + 6(5)(5-1) + 4(2)(2-1) \right) \]
\[ = \frac{1}{6} (24 + 60 + 36 + 60 + 8) = \frac{188}{6} = 31.33 \]

Therefore, we have 31 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

\[ <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 0, 4>, <3, 1, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 0, 8>, <5, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 8, 9> \]

Therefore, the final answer is: [31].
