Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be counted by finding all unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

<0, 2, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
