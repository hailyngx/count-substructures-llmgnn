Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 9, 4>
<1, 9, 5>
<1, 9, 7>
<6, 3, 7>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 3>

There are a total of 14 triangles in the given graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [14].
