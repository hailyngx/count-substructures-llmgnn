Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 7, 5>
<1, 6, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 8, 0>
<3, 8, 4>
<3, 2, 5>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 5>
<7, 9, 5>

So, the number of triangles in the graph is [12].
