Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in total.
