Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 8, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the answer is [7].
