Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 7, 8>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
