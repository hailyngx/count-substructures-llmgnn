Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:  

<0, 1, 4>  
<0, 4, 5>  
<1, 4, 8>  
<3, 4, 6>  
<5, 6, 7>  
<7, 8, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
