Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all pairwise connected. Let's find these triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [2].
