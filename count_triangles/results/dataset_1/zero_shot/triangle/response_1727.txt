Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The possible triangles in the given graph are:

<7, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<0, 9, 4>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
