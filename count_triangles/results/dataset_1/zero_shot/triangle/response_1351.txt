Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 1>
<3, 2, 8>
<3, 8, 1>
<8, 7, 1>
<8, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
