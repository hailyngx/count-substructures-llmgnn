Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <0, 3, 9>,
<5, 8, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, and <5, 6, 8>.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
