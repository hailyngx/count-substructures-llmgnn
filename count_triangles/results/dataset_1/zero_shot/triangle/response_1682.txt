Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<5, 4, 6>
<0, 9, 5>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
