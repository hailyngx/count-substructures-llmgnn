Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are:
<1, 2, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<8, 3, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
