Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<6, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
