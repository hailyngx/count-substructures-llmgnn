Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 1>, <8, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the graph.
