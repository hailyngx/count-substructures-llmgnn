Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 14 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
