Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 9, 6>
<2, 7, 3>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
