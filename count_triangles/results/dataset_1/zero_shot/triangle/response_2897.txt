Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

[<0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>]
