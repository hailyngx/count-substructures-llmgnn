Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by identifying all sets of three nodes that are fully connected. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
