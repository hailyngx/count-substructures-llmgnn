Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by the nodes. 

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
