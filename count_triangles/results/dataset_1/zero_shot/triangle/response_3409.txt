Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted as follows using the provided information:

Let's list all the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 8, 7>
4. <1, 3, 2>
5. <1, 3, 9>
6. <2, 3, 4>
7. <3, 4, 5>
8. <3, 5, 7>
9. <3, 6, 9>
10. <4, 5, 6>
11. <5, 6, 9>
12. <7, 8, 0>

There are 12 triangles in total. So, the answer is [12].
