Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has multiple triangles. Let's list the unique triangles:

<0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <1, 5, 2>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
