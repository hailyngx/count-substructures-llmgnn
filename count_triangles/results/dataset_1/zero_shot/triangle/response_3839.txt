Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles:

<1, 7, 3>  
<1, 7, 5>  
<1, 8, 9>  
<1, 9, 2>  
<3, 5, 4>  
<3, 5, 6>  
<3, 7, 5>  
<5, 6, 8>  
<5, 7, 1>  
<5, 7, 3>  
<5, 8, 4>  
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 12 unique triangles in the given graph.  
So, the final answer is [12].
