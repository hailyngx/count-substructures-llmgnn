Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

[<0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 2, 6>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 0, 1>, <7, 4, 8>, <9, 3, 6>, <9, 6, 8>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
