Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 9, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 9, 4>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<8, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in total.  
So, the final answer is [11].
