Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0---3       8---9
 \         /  
  1---2---4
  |   |  
  7---5
      |
      6
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all sets of 3 nodes that are mutually connected by edges.

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 2, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
