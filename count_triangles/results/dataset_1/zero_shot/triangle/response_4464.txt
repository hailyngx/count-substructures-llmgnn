Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 8, 2>, <0, 9, 3>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 8, 0>, <1, 9, 2>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 8, 0>, <2, 9, 1>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 8, 0>, <3, 9, 1>, <4, 7, 3>, <6, 0, 7>, <6, 1, 7>, <7, 0, 8>, <7, 1, 8>, <7, 3, 9>, <8, 0, 9>, <8, 2, 9>, <9, 0, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [23].
