Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are <0, 1, 2>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, and <3, 4, 9>.
There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
