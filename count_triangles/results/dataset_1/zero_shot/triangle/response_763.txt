Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 8>, <4, 1, 8>, <6, 3, 8>
