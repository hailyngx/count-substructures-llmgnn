Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
