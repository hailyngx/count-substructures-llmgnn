Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 6, 5>
<5, 6, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
