Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [12] triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <1, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 5>, <0, 7, 0>, <1, 0, 7>, <0, 7, 1>, <5, 3, 5>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 9, 4>, <5, 9, 1>, <5, 9, 8>.
