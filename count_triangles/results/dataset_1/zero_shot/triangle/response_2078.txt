Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 8>.
