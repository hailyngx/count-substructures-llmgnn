Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
        1 - 7 - 9
       /|  |  |  |
      0 |  4  5  |
       \|  |  |  |
        3 - 8 - 6
         \______/
```

To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles by checking for nodes that are connected forming cycles of length 3.

From the given edges, the unique triangles in this graph are: 

<0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
