Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are:

<1, 4, 5>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 9, 6>
<2, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
