Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [10].
