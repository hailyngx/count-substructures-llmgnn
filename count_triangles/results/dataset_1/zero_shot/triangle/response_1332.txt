Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 1>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <6, 5, 1>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
