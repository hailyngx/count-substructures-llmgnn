Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by identifying all the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are connected by edges.

After analyzing the given graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 5>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 7, 1>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 9, 8>
<4, 0, 5>
<5, 2, 8>
<5, 3, 8>
<8, 1, 7>
<8, 1, 9>
<8, 2, 5>
<8, 2, 6>
<8, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
