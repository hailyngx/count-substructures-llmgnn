Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>,
<0, 1, 4>,
<0, 7, 2>,
<1, 3, 4>,
<3, 4, 5>,
<5, 7, 0>.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in total.
