Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<5, 2, 3>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
