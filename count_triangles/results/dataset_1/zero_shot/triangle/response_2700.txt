Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 7, 1>
<4, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the graph. 
So, the final answer is [5].
