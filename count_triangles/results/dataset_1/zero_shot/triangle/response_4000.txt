Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is [6].

The unique triangles are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <6, 8, 9>.
