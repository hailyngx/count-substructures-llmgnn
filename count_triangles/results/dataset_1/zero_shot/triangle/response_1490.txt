Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 2>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 9, 8>, and <4, 7, 8>. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
