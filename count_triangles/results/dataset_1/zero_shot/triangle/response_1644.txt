Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a simple graph can be counted by looking at each possible set of 3 nodes and checking if they form a triangle.

Given the graph provided, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 8>, 
<1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 7, 3>, 
<2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 8>,
<3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 0>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 7, 1>,
<4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 2>, <5, 6, 0>,
<5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 3>, <6, 7, 1>, <6, 7, 3>,
<6, 8, 0>, <7, 2, 3>, <7, 3, 8>, <8, 0, 2>, and
<8, 2, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [29].
