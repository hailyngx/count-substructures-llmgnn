Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<0, 1, 4>, 
<0, 1, 5>, 
<0, 5, 6>, 
<1, 2, 3>, 
<1, 4, 8>, 
<2, 3, 9>, 
<5, 6, 9>, 
<5, 8, 1>, 
<6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
