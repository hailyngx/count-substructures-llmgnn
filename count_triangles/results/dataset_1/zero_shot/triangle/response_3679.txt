Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are [13] triangles in this graph. 
The triangles are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 0>, <2, 0, 5>, <3, 0, 7>, <3, 1, 7>.
