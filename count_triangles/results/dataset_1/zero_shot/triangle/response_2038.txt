Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 8, 7>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
