Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<0, 3, 4> 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
