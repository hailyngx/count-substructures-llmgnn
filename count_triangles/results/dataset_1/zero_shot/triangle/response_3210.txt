Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
