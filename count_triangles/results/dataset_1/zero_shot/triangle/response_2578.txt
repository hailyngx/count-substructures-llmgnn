Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>]
