Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
