Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The list of triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
