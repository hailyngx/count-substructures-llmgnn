Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [2].

The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 9> and <0, 4, 9>. Thus, the final answer is [2].
