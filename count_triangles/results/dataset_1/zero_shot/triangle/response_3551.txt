Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<1, 3, 8>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 9, 8>
<3, 8, 5>
<6, 2, 5>
<8, 9, 1>

There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
