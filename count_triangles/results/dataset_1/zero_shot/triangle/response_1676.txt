Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, 1, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. 

The final answer is [6].
