Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<[0, 6, 9]>
<[2, 4, 7]>
<[2, 6, 9]>
<[4, 7, 8]>
<[9, 3, 6]>
<[7, 5, 8]>
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
