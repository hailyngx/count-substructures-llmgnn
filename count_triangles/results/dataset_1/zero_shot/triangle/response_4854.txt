Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 9, 5>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
