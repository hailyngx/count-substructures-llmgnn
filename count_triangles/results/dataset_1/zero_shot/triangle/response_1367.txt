Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 7, 3>, <1, 6, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 7, 9>, and <4, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
