Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. Let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

A triangle in a graph is formed by 3 connected nodes. I will list them in ascending order for clarity.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 8, 7>
<4, 1, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<9, 7, 0>

So, the number of triangles in the given graph is 11.

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
