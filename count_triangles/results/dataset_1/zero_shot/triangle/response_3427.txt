Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in this graph.
