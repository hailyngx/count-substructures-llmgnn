Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 6, 4>, <8, 9, 7>.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
