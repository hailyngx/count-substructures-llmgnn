Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique triangles in this graph.

The triangles are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<3, 2, 5>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
