Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph:

[<0, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>]
