Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated from the number of triangles each node is a part of. 

Upon analyzing the graph:
- Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 1 forms no triangles.
- Node 2 forms a triangle with node 9.
- Node 3 forms no triangles.
- Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 4.
- Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 5.
- Node 8 forms no triangles.
- Node 9 forms no triangles.

Therefore, the unique triangles in the given graph are <0, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, and <6, 7, 8>. 

There are a total of 4 unique triangles in the given graph. So the final answer is [4].
