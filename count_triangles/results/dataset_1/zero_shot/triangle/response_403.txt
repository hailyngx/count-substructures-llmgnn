Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<1, 2, 4>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
