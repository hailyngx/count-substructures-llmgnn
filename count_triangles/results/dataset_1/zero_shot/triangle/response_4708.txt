Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 4>
<1, 0, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 3, 9>
<6, 9, 7>
<8, 0, 1>
<9, 1, 2>
<9, 6, 7>
<9, 7, 5>
<9, 8, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
