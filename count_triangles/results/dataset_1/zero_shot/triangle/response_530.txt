Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

            1 --- 7 --- 8 --- 9
           /      |        /
          /       |       /
         4 ------ 2 -----3
          \      /|\     |
           \    / | \    |
             0 ----5 ----6

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Upon analyzing the graph, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 4. Thus, the answer is [4].
