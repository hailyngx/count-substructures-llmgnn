Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of triangles each node participates in and dividing by 3 (since each triangle involves 3 nodes). To simplify the calculation, we can find the number of triangles for each node and sum them up. The triangles are as follows:

Node 0: None
Node 1: None
Node 2: <2, 3, 4>
Node 3: <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 5>
Node 4: <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 8>
Node 5: <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 8>
Node 6: None
Node 7: <3, 4, 7>
Node 8: <4, 5, 8>
Node 9: None

Summing up the number of triangles each node participates in: 0 triangles + 0 triangles + 1 triangle + 2 triangles + 3 triangles + 2 triangles + 0 triangles + 1 triangle + 1 triangle + 0 triangles = 10 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10]. The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 8>, and <3, 4, 7>.
