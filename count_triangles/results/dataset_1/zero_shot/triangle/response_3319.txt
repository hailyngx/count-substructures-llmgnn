Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:
```
    1 -- 6
    | \  |
    |  \ |
    6 -- 2
    |    |
    7 -- 3 -- 5
    |    |
    6 -- 8
    |
    3 -- 9
```

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <1, 2, 6>
2. <2, 3, 7>
3. <3, 4, 8>
4. <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [4].
