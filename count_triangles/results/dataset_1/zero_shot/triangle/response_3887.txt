Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 1, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<8, 9, 2>

There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
