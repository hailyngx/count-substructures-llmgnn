Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of 3-cycles, where each triangle forms a 3-cycle.

From the given list of edges in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8.

Calculating the number of triangles:
- Nodes 0, 1, and 8 form a triangle.
- Nodes 5, 8, and 9 form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and they are <0, 1, 8> and <5, 8, 9>.
