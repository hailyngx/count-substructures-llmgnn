Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
