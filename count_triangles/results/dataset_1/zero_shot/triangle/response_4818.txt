Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 -- 1 -- 7
    |    |    |
    3 -- 5    9
    |    |
    2    6
```

There are 6 triangles in this graph:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <3, 6, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
