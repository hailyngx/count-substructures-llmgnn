Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 9, 1>, <0, 9, 3>, <2, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 6>
