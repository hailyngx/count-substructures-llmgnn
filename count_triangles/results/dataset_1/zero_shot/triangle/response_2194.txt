Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

0 --- 2 --- 1     8
|           |           |
9           4     5
              |
              6 --- 7 --- 3
                            |
                            9

To count the number of triangles in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 2.
- Node 5 is connected to node 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8.

By analyzing the connections, we can see the triangles in the graph are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. The answer is [6].
