Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
