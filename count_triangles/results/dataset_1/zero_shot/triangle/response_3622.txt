Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the triangles formed by each set of 3 nodes connected by edges.

Upon analysis, we find that there are 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:
<1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 7, 2>, <3, 7, 4>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 2>, <5, 7, 2>, <7, 2, 9>, <7, 4, 9>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
