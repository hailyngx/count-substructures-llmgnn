Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 6>
<3, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the graph.
