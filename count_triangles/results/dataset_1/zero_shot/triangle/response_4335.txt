Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, 3, 9>, <3, 6, 4>, and <5, 7, 9> triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, there are [3] triangles in total.
