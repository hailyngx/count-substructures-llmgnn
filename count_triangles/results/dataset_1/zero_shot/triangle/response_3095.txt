Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 7, 6>, <7, 9, 8>]
