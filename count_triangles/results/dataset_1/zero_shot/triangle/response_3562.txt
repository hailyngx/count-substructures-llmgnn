Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 4>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 9, 3>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
