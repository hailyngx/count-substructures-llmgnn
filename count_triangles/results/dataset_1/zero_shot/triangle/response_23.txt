Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in this graph. Here they are:

[<0, 1, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
