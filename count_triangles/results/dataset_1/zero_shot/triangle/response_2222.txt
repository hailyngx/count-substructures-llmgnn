Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles:
<7, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<7, 8, 3>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in total.
