Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 4>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
