Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 2, 4>
<8, 5, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
