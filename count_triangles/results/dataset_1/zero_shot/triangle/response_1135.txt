Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 9, 0>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 9, 0>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
