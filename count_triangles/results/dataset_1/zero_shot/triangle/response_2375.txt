Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by counting the number of triangles each node participates in. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other forming a complete subgraph of three nodes.

For this given graph:
- Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 3 does not form any triangles.
- Node 4 does not form any triangles.
- Node 5 does not form any triangles.
- Node 6 does not form any triangles.
- Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 8 does not form any triangles.
- Node 9 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 2.

Therefore, the triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 7>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
