Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 4>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 1>, <5, 4, 7>, <6, 2, 8>, <6, 8, 2>, <7, 1, 4>.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
