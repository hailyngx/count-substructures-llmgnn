Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
- <0, 4, 3>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 5, 2>
- <0, 5, 3>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 6, 2>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <4, 7, 5>
- <4, 7, 6>
- <4, 9, 8>
- <5, 7, 6>
- <5, 7, 4>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <5, 8, 2>
- <6, 7, 4>
- <6, 7, 5>
- <8, 9, 4>

So, there are a total of 19 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [19].
