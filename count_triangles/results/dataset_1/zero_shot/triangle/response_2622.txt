Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by examining all possible combinations of 3 nodes that form a triangle.

Upon examining the given graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles based on the identified unique triangles:
