Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the set of nodes and edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges in a closed loop.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <0, 5, 7>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <3, 6, 7>
7. <3, 7, 8>
8. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
