Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by checking each possible triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle. Let's list all the unique triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <1, 4, 7>
5. <4, 7, 9>
6. <4, 8, 9>
7. <6, 0, 2>
8. <6, 0, 9>
9. <9, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
