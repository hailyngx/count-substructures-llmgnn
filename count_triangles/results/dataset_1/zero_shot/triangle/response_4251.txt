Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be determined by searching for combinations of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Upon examining the given graph, the triangles found are: 
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 8, 4>
<2, 3, 7>
