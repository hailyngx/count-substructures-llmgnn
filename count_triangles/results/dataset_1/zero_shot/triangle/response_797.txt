Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 8, 1>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 7, 5>, <3, 8, 5>, <4, 1, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <8, 3, 1>.
