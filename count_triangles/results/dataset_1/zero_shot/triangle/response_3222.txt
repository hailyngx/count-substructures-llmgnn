Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
    0 -- 5         7
    |             |
    8 -- 4 -- 2 -- 3 -- 9
          |
          7
```

Now let's find the triangles in this graph:
1. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 8, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 2>
4. Triangle <0, 8, 7>
5. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
7. Triangle <2, 8, 4>
8. Triangle <2, 8, 7>
9. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
10. Triangle <3, 9, 8>
11. Triangle <3, 9, 7>
12. Triangle <4, 8, 7>
13. Triangle <4, 8, 9>
14. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.  
So, the final answer is [14].
