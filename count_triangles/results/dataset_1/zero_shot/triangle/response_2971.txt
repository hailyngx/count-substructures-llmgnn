Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph: 

\[<1, 2, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 1, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 9, 4>, <3, 9, 5>, <4, 9, 5>, <6, 3, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 1, 9>, <7, 2, 9>, <9, 4, 5>\]

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13].
