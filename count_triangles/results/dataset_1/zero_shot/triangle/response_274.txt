Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node participates in. Let's calculate this:

Node 0: []
Node 1: []
Node 2: []
Node 3: []
Node 4: <0, 2, 4>
Node 5: []
Node 6: []
Node 7: []
Node 8: []
Node 9: []

Total number of triangles: [1]
