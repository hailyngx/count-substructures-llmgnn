Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
    
           0 -- 5 -- 6 -- 1
           |    |    |    
           3 -- 9 -- 2 -- 7
            \       |     
              8     4

The total number of triangles in this graph is [4]. The unique triangles are <0, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, and <2, 7, 9>.
