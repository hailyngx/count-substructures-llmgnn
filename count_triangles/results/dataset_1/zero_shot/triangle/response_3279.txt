Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 3>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
