Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 2>
<5, 2, 6>
<5, 2, 9>
<6, 3, 7>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 7, 2>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 1>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 4, 2>
<8, 1, 9>
<8, 6, 7>
<9, 8, 1>
<9, 8, 6>

There are 24 triangles in total.  
Therefore, the final answer is [24].
