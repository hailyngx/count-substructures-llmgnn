Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining all possible triangles formed by the nodes and checking if each triangle is closed. 

Upon analyzing the graph based on the provided edges, the following triangles can be identified:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 3, 9>
<8, 4, 9>

Hence, there are a total of [10] unique triangles in the graph.
