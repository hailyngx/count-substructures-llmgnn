Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After examining the given graph, the total number of triangles is [8], and the unique triangles are <0, 3, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 1, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, and <6, 7, 5>.
