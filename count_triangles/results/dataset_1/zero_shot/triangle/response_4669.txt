Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:
[<0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <6, 0, 4>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 8, 9>]
