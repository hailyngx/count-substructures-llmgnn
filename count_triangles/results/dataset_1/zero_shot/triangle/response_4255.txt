Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 6, 3>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
