Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 3>, <1, 0, 3>, <2, 3, 0>, <3, 0, 4>, <3, 5, 0>, <4, 0, 3>, <5, 0, 3>
These triangles are a total of 10. Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
