Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 6>

Hence, there are 5 triangles in total.  
Therefore, the answer is [5].
