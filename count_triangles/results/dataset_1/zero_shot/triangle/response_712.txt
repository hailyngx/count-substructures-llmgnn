Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 8, 3>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 8>
<8, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in total. So, the final answer is [9].
