Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
We can find the triangles in the given graph by checking each set of three nodes that form a closed loop. Let's list the triangles and count them:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <1, 2, 6>
6. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
7. Triangle <3, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
