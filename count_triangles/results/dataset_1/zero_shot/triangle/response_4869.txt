Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are: <0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 9, 7>, <5, 4, 9>.  
Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [7].
