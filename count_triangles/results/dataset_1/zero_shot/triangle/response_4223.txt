Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique triangles in the given graph:
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
