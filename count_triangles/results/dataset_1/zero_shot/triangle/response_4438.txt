Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <7, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
