Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by examining each combination of three nodes and checking if they form a triangle.

There are 8 unique triangles in the given graph:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
