Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 5>, <3, 6, 7>, and <6, 8, 9>. 
Hence, there are [4] triangles in total.
