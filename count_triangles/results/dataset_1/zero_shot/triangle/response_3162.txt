Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: 
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 4, 6>
<5, 4, 8>
<5, 4, 9>
<5, 9, 6>
<9, 6, 7>
<9, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles = 14
Therefore, the answer is [14].
