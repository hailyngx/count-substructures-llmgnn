Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of closed paths of length 3. This can be done by examining the nodes connected to each node to identify triangles.

Upon examining the given graph, the unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
