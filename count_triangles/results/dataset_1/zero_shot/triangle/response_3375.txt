Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be counted by examining all possible triangles formed by the given edges. 

After checking for all triangles, we find that there are 6 unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
