Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 3>
<4, 5, 6>
<6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
