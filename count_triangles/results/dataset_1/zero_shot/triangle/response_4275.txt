Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:
```
  0 -- 4 -- 9  
  |    |    |  
  7 -- 1    |  
       |    |  
       3 -- 5  
            |  
            2  
            |  
            6
```

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. <0, 4, 1>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <4, 1, 9>
4. <1, 9, 4>
5. <4, 0, 7>
6. <0, 7, 1>
7. <1, 7, 3>
8. <7, 3, 5>
9. <1, 4, 9>

There are 9 triangles in total. Therefore, the answer is [9].
