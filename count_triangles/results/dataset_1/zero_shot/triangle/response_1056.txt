Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding all the unique combinations of three nodes that are directly connected to each other. Let's count the number of triangles for this graph.

The triangles found in this graph are:
<2, 4, 8>  
<2, 4, 9>  
<3, 4, 8>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
