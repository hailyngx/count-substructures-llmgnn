Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 25 unique triangles in the given graph, which are the following:

<1, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 7, 2>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 3>
<5, 4, 9>
<4, 3, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<1, 9, 3>
<1, 9, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<5, 8, 4>
<5, 8, 9>
<8, 6, 4>
<8, 6, 5>
<8, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 3>
<5, 9, 3>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 9>
<4, 3, 5>
<3, 9, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<3, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [25].
