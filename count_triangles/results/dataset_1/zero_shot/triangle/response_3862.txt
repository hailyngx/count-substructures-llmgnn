Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
