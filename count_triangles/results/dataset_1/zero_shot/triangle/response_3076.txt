Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 14 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<8, 9, 3>

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
