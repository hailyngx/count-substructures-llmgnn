Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 5>
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 8, 9>
<8, 2, 6>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 4, 9>
<8, 7, 9>

So, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
