Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 1, 5>
<2, 4, 0>
<4, 9, 0>
<5, 7, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
