Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of closed paths of length 3 within the graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:

<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
