Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 2, 5>, <3, 2, 8>, <4, 6, 8>.
