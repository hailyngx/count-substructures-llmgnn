Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

- 0 is connected to 3
- 1 is connected to 2, 4, 6, 8
- 2 is connected to 1, 6, 7, 8
- 3 is connected to 0, 6, 7, 9
- 4 is connected to 1, 5, 8, 9
- 5 is connected to 4, 8
- 6 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 7
- 7 is connected to 2, 3, 6
- 8 is connected to 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
- 9 is connected to 3, 4, 8

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we can analyze the triangles that can be formed. The triangles are <1, 2, 6>, <4, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
