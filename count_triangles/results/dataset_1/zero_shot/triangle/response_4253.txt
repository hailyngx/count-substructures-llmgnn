Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by counting the number of paths of length 2 (triangles) between the nodes.

By examining the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
