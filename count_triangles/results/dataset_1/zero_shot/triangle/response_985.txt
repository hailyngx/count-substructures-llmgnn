Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 1>
<8, 9, 1>

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in total.
