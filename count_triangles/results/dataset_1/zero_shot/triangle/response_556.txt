Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <0, 6, 8>.
    
    There are [3] triangles in total.
