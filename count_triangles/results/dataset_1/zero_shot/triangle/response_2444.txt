Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Below is the list of unique triangles:
[<1, 2, 7>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 8, 2>, <6, 7, 4>]
