Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be found by calculating the number of triangles each node participates in. Let's calculate it for this graph:

Node 0 participates in 2 triangles: <0, 6, 4> and <0, 6, 8>
Node 1 participates in 1 triangle: <1, 3, 5>
Node 2 participates in 2 triangles: <2, 4, 6> and <2, 5, 7>
Node 3 participates in 2 triangles: <3, 1, 6> and <3, 5, 7>
Node 4 participates in 2 triangles: <4, 1, 6> and <4, 2, 6>
Node 5 participates in 3 triangles: <5, 2, 4>, <5, 2, 7>, and <5, 3, 7>
Node 6 participates in 2 triangles: <6, 0, 1> and <6, 0, 4>
Node 7 participates in 1 triangle: <7, 2, 5>
Node 8 participates in 1 triangle: <8, 0, 3>
Node 9 participates in 1 triangle: <9, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [17] and the unique triangles are <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 1, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 1, 6>, <4, 2, 6>, <5, 2, 4>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 3, 7>, <6, 0, 1>, <6, 0, 4>, <7, 2, 5>, <8, 0, 3>, <9, 3, 5>.
