Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be found by checking each combination of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Counting triangles:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 4, 7>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 5, 1>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 5, 3>
4. Triangle 4: <1, 5, 3>
5. Triangle 5: <1, 7, 4>
6. Triangle 6: <1, 7, 8>
7. Triangle 7: <2, 1, 5>
8. Triangle 8: <3, 2, 1>
9. Triangle 9: <3, 2, 5>
10. Triangle 10: <3, 2, 7>
11. Triangle 11: <3, 5, 0>
12. Triangle 12: <3, 5, 2>
13. Triangle 13: <3, 5, 1>
14. Triangle 14: <3, 5, 7>
15. Triangle 15: <3, 7, 1>
16. Triangle 16: <3, 7, 4>
17. Triangle 17: <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [17].
