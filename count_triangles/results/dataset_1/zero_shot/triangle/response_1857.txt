Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in total.
