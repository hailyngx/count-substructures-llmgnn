Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 8, 4>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 6>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 0>
<5, 7, 2>
<6, 8, 4>
<7, 9, 4>
<8, 6, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 23.
