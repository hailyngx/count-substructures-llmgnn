Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula: 

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i} (\text{degree of node } i)^2 - \text{Number of edges} \]

Given the degrees of the nodes:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3

Using the formula, we can calculate the number of triangles:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} [ (4^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 + 3^2) - 30] = 4 \]

So, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: <0, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the final answer is: [4].
