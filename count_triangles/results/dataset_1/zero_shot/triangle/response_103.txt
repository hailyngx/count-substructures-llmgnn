Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
In this graph, there are 6 unique triangles:
<[0, 7, 8], [1, 3, 4], [1, 4, 9], [2, 6, 7], [4, 5, 7], [4, 5, 9]>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
