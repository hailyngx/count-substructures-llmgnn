Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
