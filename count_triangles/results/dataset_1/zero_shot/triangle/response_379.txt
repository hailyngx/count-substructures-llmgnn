Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 7, 4>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 1, 9>
<8, 9, 1>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
