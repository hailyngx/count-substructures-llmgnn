Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [<0, 2, 4>, <2, 5, 6>] triangles in the graph. So, the final answer is [2].
