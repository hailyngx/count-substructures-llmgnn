Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 0, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 1, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
