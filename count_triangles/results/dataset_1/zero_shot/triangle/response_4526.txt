Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by looking at each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
