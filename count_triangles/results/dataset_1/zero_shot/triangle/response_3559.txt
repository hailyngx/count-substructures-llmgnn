Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are connected by edges.

By examining the list of edges, we can identify the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle: <2, 3, 5>
2. Triangle: <2, 4, 9>
3. Triangle: <2, 5, 7>
4. Triangle: <4, 5, 7>
5. Triangle: <2, 3, 7>
6. Triangle: <3, 5, 7>
7. Triangle: <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
