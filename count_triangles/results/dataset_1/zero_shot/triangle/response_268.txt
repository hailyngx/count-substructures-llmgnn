Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
  
The triangles are:
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
