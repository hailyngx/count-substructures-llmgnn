Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains the following unique triangles: <1, 2, 6>, <2, 3, 6>.
Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
