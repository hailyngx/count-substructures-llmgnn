Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by counting all possible triangles formed by the 10 nodes. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [19].
