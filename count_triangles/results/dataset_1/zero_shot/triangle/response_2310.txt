Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Thus, the final answer is [7].

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 9, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 3, 2>
<7, 9, 2>
<8, 6, 0>
<9, 2, 4>
