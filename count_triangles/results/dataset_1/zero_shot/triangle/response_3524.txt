Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be determined by counting the number of triangles formed by each set of three connected nodes.
The possible triangles in this graph are: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 0, 2>, and <7, 8, 9>.
Thus, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
