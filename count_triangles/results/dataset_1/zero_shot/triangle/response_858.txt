Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles:
  
- <0, 1, 5>
- <3, 6, 5>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <3, 6, 8>

So, the final answer is [4].
