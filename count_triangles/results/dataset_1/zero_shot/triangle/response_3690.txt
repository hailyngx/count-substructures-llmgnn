Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
```
    1 -- 6
   /|    | \
  7 3 -- 2 8
   \|    | /
    4 -- 9
      \  /
       0
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we look for cycles of length 3, also known as triangles. Here are the triangles found in this graph:

[<1, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <6, 8, 9>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
