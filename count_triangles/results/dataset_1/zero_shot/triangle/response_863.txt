Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in this graph. Here they are listed:
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 6, 8>

The final answer is [9].
