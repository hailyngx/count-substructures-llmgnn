Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 1, 8>
<5, 0, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
