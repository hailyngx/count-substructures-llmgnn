Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by checking for each possible set of three nodes whether they form a triangle or not. Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:    

[31]

And the unique triangles found are:
<1, 3, 7> <1, 3, 8> <1, 6, 7> <1, 6, 8> <2, 3, 5> <2, 3, 8> <4, 5, 6>
