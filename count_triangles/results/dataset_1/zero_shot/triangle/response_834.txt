Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of closed loops of length 3. In this case, we will need to find all the triangles in the given graph based on the provided edges.

The triangles can be formed by looking for nodes that share edges between each other in such a way that they form a loop of length 3.

Based on the given edges, the triangles in the graph are:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<3, 2, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 5, 4>
<8, 1, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [10].
