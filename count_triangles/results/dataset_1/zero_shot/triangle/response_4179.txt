Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula: 
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i (d_i - 1) (d_i - 2), \]
where \( d_i \) represents the degree of node i in the graph.

First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 6
- Node 9 has degree 3

Plugging these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} [4(3)(2) + 5(4)(3) + 4(3)(2) + 2(1)(0) + 4(3)(2) + 3(2)(1) + 2(1)(0) + 1(0)(-1) + 6(5)(4) + 3(2)(1)] \]
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} [24 + 60 + 24 + 0 + 24 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 120 + 6] \]
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} [264] \]
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = 44 \]

Therefore, there are 44 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 8>, <8, 5, 9>, <8, 2, 9> 

The final answer is: [44].
