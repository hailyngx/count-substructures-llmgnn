Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
