Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<[0, 2, 5]>
<[0, 5, 8]>
<[1, 2, 5]>
<[1, 5, 7]>
<[2, 5, 6]>
<[5, 6, 7]>
<[5, 6, 9]>
<[5, 7, 9]>
<[6, 7, 9]>
<[6, 8, 9]>
<[7, 8, 9]>
<[0, 8, 2]>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
