Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by every possible set of 3 nodes.

The triangles in this graph are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 9, 8>, <8, 9, 2>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
