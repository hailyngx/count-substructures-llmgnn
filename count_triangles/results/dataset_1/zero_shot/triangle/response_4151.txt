Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by summing up the number of triangles each node is part of. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected in a closed loop.

After examining the provided graph, we can determine the triangles present. The triangles are as follows:
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
