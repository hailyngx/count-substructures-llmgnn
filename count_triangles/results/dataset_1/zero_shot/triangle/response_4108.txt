Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
[<0, 3, 5> <3, 5, 6> <3, 6, 9> <3, 5, 8>]
