Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
    1 -- 2
   /      \
  0        4 -- 8
   \      /    /
    5    9    3
              |
              7
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we can identify the triangles by checking for any three nodes that are all connected to each other. After analyzing the graph, we find that there are 2 triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle formed by nodes 0, 4, and 9. (<0, 4, 9>)
2. Triangle formed by nodes 2, 4, and 8. (<2, 4, 8>)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
