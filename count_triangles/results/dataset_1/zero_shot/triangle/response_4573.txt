Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 3>
<2, 4, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
