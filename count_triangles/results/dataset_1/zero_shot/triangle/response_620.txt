Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph:
[<0, 8, 9> <0, 3, 8> <0, 6, 9> <1, 2, 7> <2, 7, 9> <8, 6, 9>]  [6 triangles total]
