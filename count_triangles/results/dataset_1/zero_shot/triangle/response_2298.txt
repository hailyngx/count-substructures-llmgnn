Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 7, 2>, <6, 2, 4>, <1, 8, 3>, and <1, 7, 8>. 

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
