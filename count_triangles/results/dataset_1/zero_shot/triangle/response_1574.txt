Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by summing up the number of triangles each node is part of, and then dividing by 3 since each triangle involves 3 nodes.

In this case, let's count the triangles:
- Node 0 is part of triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>
- Node 1 is part of triangles: <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 8>
- Node 2 is part of triangles: <2, 4, 8>
- Node 6 is part of triangles: <6, 3, 5>, <6, 3, 8>
- Node 8 is part of a triangle: <8, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is 5. So, the answer is [5].
