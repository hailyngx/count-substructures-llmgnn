Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 9, 5>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 0, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <5, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
