Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles found in the given graph are:
<0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 2>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 0>, <2, 5, 8>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 1, 3>, <6, 4, 0>, <6, 4, 1>, <6, 4, 9>, <7, 8, 2>, <8, 2, 5>
Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
