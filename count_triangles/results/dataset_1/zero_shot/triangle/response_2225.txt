Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
