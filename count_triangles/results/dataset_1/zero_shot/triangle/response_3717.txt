Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
