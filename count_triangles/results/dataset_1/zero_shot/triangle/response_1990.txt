Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. The answer is [10].
