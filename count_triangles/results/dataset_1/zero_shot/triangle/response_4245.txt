Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
