Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Triangles are formed when three nodes are all interconnected with each other. I will identify the triangles in this graph.

The graph has 10 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Looking at the edges:
- Node 0 is connected with nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected with nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected with nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected with node 1.
- Node 4 is connected with node 9.
- Node 5 is connected with nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected with nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected with nodes 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected with nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

By analyzing the connections, the triangles identified are:
- <1, 6, 9>
- <1, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2. Hence, the answer is: [2]
