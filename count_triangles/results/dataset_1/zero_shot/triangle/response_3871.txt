Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are:
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
