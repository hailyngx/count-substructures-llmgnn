Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in this graph. Here they are:

[<0, 7, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <7, 9, 4>]
