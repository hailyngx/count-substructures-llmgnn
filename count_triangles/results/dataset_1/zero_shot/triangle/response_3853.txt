Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are total of 18 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
<[0, 2, 5], [0, 2, 7], [0, 6, 1], [0, 6, 9], [0, 8, 4], [0, 8, 9], [1, 3, 7], [1, 5, 2], [1, 5, 4], [2, 5, 4], [3, 7, 2], [3, 7, 9], [4, 5, 8], [6, 0, 8], [6, 1, 7], [7, 2, 5], [8, 0, 9], [9, 0, 3]>.

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
