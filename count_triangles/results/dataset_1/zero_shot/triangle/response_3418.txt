Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<0, 2, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
