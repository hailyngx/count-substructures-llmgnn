Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of paths of length 2 (triangles) between all possible node pairs. Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 5>
<3, 7, 0>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 8, 2>
<3, 8, 7>
<3, 9, 5>
<3, 9, 8>
<5, 6, 3>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 9, 3>
<6, 3, 5>
<6, 4, 6>
<6, 5, 9>
<7, 0, 5>
<7, 0, 3>
<7, 2, 8>
<7, 3, 5>
<7, 3, 8>
<7, 8, 2>
<8, 2, 7>
<8, 3, 5>
<8, 3, 7>
<8, 3, 9>
<8, 7, 3>
<8, 7, 0>
<8, 9, 3>
<9, 3, 5>
<9, 3, 8>
<9, 5, 0>
<9, 5, 3>
<9, 5, 6>
<9, 8, 3>

There are a total of 36 triangles in this graph. Answer: [36]
