Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 3, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 7>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
