Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 6>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
