Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 6>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
