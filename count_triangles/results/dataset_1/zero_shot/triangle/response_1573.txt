Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [9].

Unique triangles found: <1, 7, 3>, <8, 4, 3>, <8, 5, 3>, <4, 1, 7>, <2, 7, 3>, <8, 5, 4>, <2, 6, 2>, <2, 7, 1>, <7, 3, 4>.
