Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of triangles each node is part of and then dividing that count by 6 since each triangle is counted 3 times (once for each of its vertices). 

Looking at the given graph, we can list the triangles:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<1, 2, 7> is repeated, so we list it only once.

Each node is part of the following number of triangles:
Node 0: 0 triangles
Node 1: 4 triangles
Node 2: 3 triangles
Node 3: 1 triangle
Node 4: 1 triangle
Node 5: 2 triangles
Node 6: 0 triangles
Node 7: 4 triangles
Node 8: 1 triangle
Node 9: 1 triangle

Adding these values together gives the total number of triangles as 17.

Therefore, the final answer is [17].
