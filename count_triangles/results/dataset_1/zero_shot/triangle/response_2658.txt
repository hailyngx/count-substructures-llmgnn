Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph described has the following triangles:
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<7, 4, 9>

There are 9 triangles in this graph in total. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
