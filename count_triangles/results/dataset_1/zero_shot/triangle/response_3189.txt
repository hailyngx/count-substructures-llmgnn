Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can form the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 8, 6>
<0, 9, 5>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
