Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 8, 2>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 9, 7>
<3, 6, 1>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 0, 5>
<5, 0, 2>
<5, 8, 1>
<6, 1, 7>
<7, 4, 9>
<8, 5, 0>
<8, 1, 7>
<9, 3, 6>
<9, 7, 4>
<9, 8, 1>

Counting all these unique triangles, we get a total of [23] triangles.
