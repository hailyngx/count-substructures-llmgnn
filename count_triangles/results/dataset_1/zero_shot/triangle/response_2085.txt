Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

There are a total of 6 triangles in the graph:
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <2, 7, 6>
- <2, 8, 3>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
