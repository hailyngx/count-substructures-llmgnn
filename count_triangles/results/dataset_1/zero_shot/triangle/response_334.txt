Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <1, 4, 6>
5. <4, 6, 8>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
