Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=0}^{n} d_i(d_i-1)(d_i-2) \]

where \(d_i\) represents the degree of node \(i\).

Calculating the number of triangles for this graph:
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6}[(3)(2)(1) + (4)(3)(2) + (1)(0)(-1) + (2)(1)(0) + (3)(2)(1) + (5)(4)(3) + (4)(3)(2) + (3)(2)(1) + (4)(3)(2) + (4)(3)(2)] \]

\[ = \frac{1}{6}[6 + 24 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 60 + 24 + 6 + 24 + 24] \]
\[ = \frac{1}{6}[174] = 29 \]

Therefore, there are 29 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 4, 9>, <7, 6, 9>, <4, 0, 6>, <1, 5, 3>, <9, 2, 4>, <9, 2, 6>, <9, 2, 7>, <8, 6, 7>  

Therefore, the final answer is [29].
