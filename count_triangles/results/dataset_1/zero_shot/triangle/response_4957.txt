Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <0, 8, 9>
5. <1, 3, 7>
6. <1, 7, 9>
7. <2, 5, 8>
8. <2, 8, 9>
9. <6, 4, 9>
  
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
