Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<0, 2, 8>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in total.
