Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually adjacent to each other.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 4>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
