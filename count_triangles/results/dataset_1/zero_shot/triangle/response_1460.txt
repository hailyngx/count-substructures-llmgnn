Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of closed loops of length 3 (triangles).

In this graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<2, 1, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<6, 4, 8>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
