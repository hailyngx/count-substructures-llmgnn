Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 3>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 0>, <3, 7, 0>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 8, 1>, <5, 2, 6>, <6, 7, 1>

There are 10 triangles in total in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [10].
