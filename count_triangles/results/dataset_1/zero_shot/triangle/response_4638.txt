Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<[1, 6, 9]>  
<[3, 5, 9]>  
<[2, 6, 8]>  
<[0, 1, 7]>  

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
