Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph given has the following triangles:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 7, 4>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 7, 2>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 7, 0>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 5, 8>

There are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph, so the final answer is [12].
