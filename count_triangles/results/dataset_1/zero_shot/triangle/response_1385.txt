Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles found in this graph are: <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 9>  

There are a total of [8] triangles in this graph.
