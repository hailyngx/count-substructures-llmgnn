Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the sets of three nodes that form a triangle. Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to node 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.

Let's now list the triangles that exist in this graph:

1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <0, 7, 2>
3. <0, 7, 4>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
