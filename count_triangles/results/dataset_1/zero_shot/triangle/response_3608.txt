Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:

<[0, 1, 4]>
<[0, 1, 5]>
<[0, 4, 9]>
<[1, 4, 2]>
<[1, 4, 7]>
<[1, 5, 0]>
<[1, 5, 0]>
<[2, 4, 7]>
<[2, 6, 3]>
<[4, 7, 2]>
<[4, 9, 0]>
<[9, 8, 4]>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
