Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
