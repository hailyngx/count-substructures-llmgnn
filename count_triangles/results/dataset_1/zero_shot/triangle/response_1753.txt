Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are total of 10 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles listed:

[<0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <6, 5, 0>, <9, 8, 4>, <9, 8, 7>] [10]
