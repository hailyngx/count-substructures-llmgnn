Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 2, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<7, 6, 4>

The final answer is [10].
