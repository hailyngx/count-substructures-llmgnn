Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of and then dividing by 6 since each triangle is counted 3 times (once for each node). Let's calculate this:

- Node 0 is a part of 4 triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 8>
- Node 1 is a part of 7 triangles: <1, 0, 8>, <1, 0, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 8, 5>
- Node 2 is a part of 4 triangles: <2, 1, 4>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 1>
- Node 3 is a part of 1 triangle: <3, 0, 6>
- Node 4 is a part of 2 triangles: <4, 1, 7>, <4, 1, 2>
- Node 5 is a part of 2 triangles: <5, 0, 8>, <5, 0, 3>
- Node 6 is a part of 2 triangles: <6, 2, 7>, <6, 3, 0>
- Node 7 is a part of 4 triangles: <7, 1, 8>, <7, 1, 2>, <7, 2, 1>, <7, 4, 1>
- Node 8 is a part of 4 triangles: <8, 7, 1>, <8, 7, 2>, <8, 1, 0>, <8, 0, 5>
- Node 9 is a part of 1 triangle: <9, 1, 5>

Adding up the triangles each node is a part of gives a total of 31 triangles. Dividing by 6, we get 31 / 6 = 5.16666667, which means there are 5 unique triangles in the graph.

Thus, the final answer is [5].
