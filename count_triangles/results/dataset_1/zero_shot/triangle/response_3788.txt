Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <2, 4, 8>
2. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in total.
