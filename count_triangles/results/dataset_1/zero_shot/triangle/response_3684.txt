Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph described has the following unique triangles:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 8, 5>
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 1, 8>
<2, 6, 1>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 9, 5>
<3, 4, 0>
<4, 0, 9>
<4, 3, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 9, 8>

Hence, there are a total of [15] triangles present in the graph.
