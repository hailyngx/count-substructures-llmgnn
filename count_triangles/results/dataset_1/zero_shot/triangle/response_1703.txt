Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<2, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <0, 5, 7>]
