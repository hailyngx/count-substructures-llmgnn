Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be counted by finding all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges. Let's list all the unique triangles found:

<0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <5, 7, 9>

There are 5 triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
