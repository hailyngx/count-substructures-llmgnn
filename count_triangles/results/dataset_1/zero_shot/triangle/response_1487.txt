Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 2>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 1, 5>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 1, 8>, <5, 3, 8>, <8, 2, 3>, <8, 4, 9>, <8, 5, 1>, <9, 4, 7>. 
Therefore, the final answer is [16].
