Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 4>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
