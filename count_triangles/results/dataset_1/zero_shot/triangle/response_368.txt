Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <4, 6, 9>.
