Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 2>
<8, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
