Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<2, 4, 9>  
<2, 5, 9>  
<3, 6, 8>  
<3, 7, 8>  

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
