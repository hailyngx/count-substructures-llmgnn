Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by sets of 3 nodes. Let's calculate it.

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 5, 3>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 9, 3>, <7, 6, 1>, <7, 8, 4>, <8, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
