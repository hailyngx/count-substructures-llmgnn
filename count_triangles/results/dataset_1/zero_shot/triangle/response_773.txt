Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following unique triangles:

<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 9, 5>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 9, 5>
<1, 9, 6>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
