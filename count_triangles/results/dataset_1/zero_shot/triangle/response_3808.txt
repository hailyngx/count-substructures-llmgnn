Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 6, 1>, <8, 9, 3>.

Thus, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
