Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 4>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 3, 7>
<6, 9, 0>
<6, 9, 2>
<7, 3, 6>
<7, 5, 1>
<9, 0, 3>
<9, 2, 6>
<9, 4, 7>

Therefore, there are 23 triangles in the given graph.
