Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 7, 5>
<4, 6, 2>
<7, 3, 5>
<7, 5, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
