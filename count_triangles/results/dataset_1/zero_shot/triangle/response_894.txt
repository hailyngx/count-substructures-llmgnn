Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>

So, the final answer is [5].
