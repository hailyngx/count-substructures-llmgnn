Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<8, 7, 9>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
