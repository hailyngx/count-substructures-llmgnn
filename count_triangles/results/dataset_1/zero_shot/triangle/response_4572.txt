Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 7, 2>
<4, 5, 1>
<4, 8, 7>
<5, 0, 1>
<5, 4, 8>
<8, 0, 4>
<8, 7, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
