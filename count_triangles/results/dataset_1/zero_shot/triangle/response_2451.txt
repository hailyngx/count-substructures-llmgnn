Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph be calculated as follows:

\[ Total \ triangles = \frac{1}{6}\sum_{i=1}^{10} d_i(d_i - 1)(d_i - 2) \]

where \( d_i \) represents the degree of node \( i \).

Calculating the degrees for each node:
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 3
- Node 2: degree = 3
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 3
- Node 5: degree = 4
- Node 6: degree = 3
- Node 7: degree = 3
- Node 8: degree = 5
- Node 9: degree = 4

Plugging the degrees into the formula:

\[ Total \ triangles = \frac{1}{6} [3*2*1 + 3*2*1 + 3*2*1 + 4*3*2 + 3*2*1 + 4*3*2 + 3*2*1 + 3*2*1 + 5*4*3 + 4*3*2] \]

\[ = \frac{1}{6}[6 + 6 + 6 + 24 + 6 + 24 + 6 + 6 + 60 + 24] \]

\[ = \frac{1}{6}[162] \]

\[ = 27 \]

Therefore, there are 27 triangles in the graph. 

Listing the unique triangles:

\[ [ <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 9> ] \]
