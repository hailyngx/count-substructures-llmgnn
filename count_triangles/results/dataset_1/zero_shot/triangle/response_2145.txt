Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of unique paths of length 2 between three distinct nodes. In this given graph, the unique triangles are:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
