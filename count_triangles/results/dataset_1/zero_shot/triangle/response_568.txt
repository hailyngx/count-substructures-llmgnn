Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph given has 10 nodes and 26 edges. Let's count the number of triangles in the graph.

Calculating the triangles in the graph:

<0, 1, 4>

<0, 1, 6>

<0, 1, 5>

<0, 2, 5>

<4, 1, 6>

<4, 1, 8>

<4, 6, 8>

<5, 1, 6>

<5, 1, 7>

<5, 2, 0>

<7, 8, 9>

<6, 8, 9>

<8, 4, 6>

Counting the unique triangles: [12]
