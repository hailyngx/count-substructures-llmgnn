Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph.  Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 9, 1>, <3, 1, 9>, <3, 7, 5>, <3, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <8, 5, 9>, <8, 9, 6>, <9, 5, 6>] 

So, the total number of triangles is [10].
