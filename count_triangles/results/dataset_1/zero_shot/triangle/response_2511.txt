Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of. We then divide this count by 3 because each triangle involves 3 nodes.

Calculating the triangles:
- Node 0: 1 triangle
- Node 1: 2 triangles
- Node 2: 3 triangles
- Node 3: 4 triangles
- Node 4: 0 triangles
- Node 5: 1 triangle
- Node 6: 1 triangle
- Node 7: 2 triangles
- Node 8: 1 triangle
- Node 9: 1 triangle

Adding all the triangles from each node together, we get a total of 16 triangles:

<0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 9, 2>, <7, 2, 3>, <7, 3, 5>, <8, 1, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
