Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [4].

The unique triangles found are: <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 9>.
