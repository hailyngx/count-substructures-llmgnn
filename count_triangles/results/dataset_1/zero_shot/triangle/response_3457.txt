Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 6>
<0, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 3, 7>
<6, 0, 4>
<8, 6, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
