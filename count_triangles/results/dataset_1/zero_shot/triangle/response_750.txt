Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
[<0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 6>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
