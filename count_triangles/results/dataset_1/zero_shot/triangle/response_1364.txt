Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. 

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 8, 7>
<5, 2, 9>

Counting the unique triangles, we find that there are 8 triangles in total.

Therefore, the answer is [8].
