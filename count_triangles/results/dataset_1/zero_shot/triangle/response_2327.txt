Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [14] and the unique triangles are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 2>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 8>,  <5, 6, 2>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 3>, <5, 8, 3>, <6, 8, 3>, and <7, 9, 2>.
