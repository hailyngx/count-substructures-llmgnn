Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles are:  
<0, 3, 4>  
<3, 6, 4>  
<3, 8, 2>    
<3, 9, 5>    
<4, 6, 1>  
<8, 5, 9>  

So, the answer is: [6]
