Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by each node in the graph. Here is the list of unique triangles along with the count in each triangle:

1. <0, 1, 6> - 2 triangles
2. <0, 1, 7> - 1 triangle
3. <0, 2, 6> - 1 triangle
4. <0, 5, 6> - 2 triangles
5. <1, 4, 6> - 1 triangle
6. <1, 6, 8> - 2 triangles
7. <1, 6, 9> - 1 triangle
8. <1, 7, 8> - 1 triangle
9. <1, 7, 9> - 1 triangle
10. <1, 8, 9> - 1 triangle
11. <2, 6, 8> - 1 triangle
12. <5, 6, 8> - 2 triangles
13. <5, 6, 9> - 1 triangle
14. <5, 8, 9> - 1 triangle
15. <6, 7, 8> - 1 triangle
16. <6, 8, 9> - 1 triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
