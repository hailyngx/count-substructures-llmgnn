Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [5] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 2, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 1>, <9, 3, 6>, <9, 6, 1>.
