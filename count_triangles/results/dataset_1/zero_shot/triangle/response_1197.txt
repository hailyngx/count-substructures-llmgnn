Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 0, 9>. Thus, the answer is [8].
