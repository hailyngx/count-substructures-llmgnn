Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of three-node cycles.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 4>, <1, 5, 3>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 4>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 4>, <3, 8, 5>, <3, 9, 6>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 0, 8>, <6, 3, 9>, <9, 6, 3>

Therefore, there are 20 triangles in total.
