Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:
<3, 1, 4>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 3, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
