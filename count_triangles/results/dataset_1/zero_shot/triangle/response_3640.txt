Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining all possible triangles among the nodes. 

Upon checking, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
