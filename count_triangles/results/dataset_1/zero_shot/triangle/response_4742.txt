Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 8, 7>

So the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
