Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<5, 1, 6>
<8, 6, 1>
<8, 6, 5>
<9, 8, 6>
<9, 8, 4>
<9, 4, 0>
<3, 5, 1>
<3, 9, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
