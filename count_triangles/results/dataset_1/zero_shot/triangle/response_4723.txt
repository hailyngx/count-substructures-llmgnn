Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
