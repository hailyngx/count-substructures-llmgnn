Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<2, 8, 3>
<3, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 6, 3>
<1, 2, 8>
<4, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 3>
<6, 7, 4>
<5, 3, 9>
<8, 7, 4>
<6, 0, 2>
<9, 5, 3>
<3, 8, 7>
<8, 1, 2>
<7, 6, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
