Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are total [8] triangles in the given graph, which are <0, 6, 2>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 7, 3>, <2, 8, 9>, <4, 9, 1>.
