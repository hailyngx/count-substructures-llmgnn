Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 2>, and <0, 7, 3>. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
