Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:

The unique triangles are:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 3>
