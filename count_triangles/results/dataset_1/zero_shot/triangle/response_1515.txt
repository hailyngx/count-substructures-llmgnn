Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

[<1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 0, 9>, <5, 7, 3>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 9, 6>, <7, 8, 5>] 

Therefore, the answer is [10].
