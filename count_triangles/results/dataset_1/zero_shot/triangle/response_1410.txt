Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets:

[<0, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <8, 9, 3>]
