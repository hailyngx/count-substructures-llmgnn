Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by identifying all unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected with edges. Let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 4>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
7. Triangle <4, 6, 7>

Hence, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph, represented in the brackets.
