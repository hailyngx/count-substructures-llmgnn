Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
