Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

There are a total of 8 triangles in the graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
