Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: <0, 1, 4>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 8>.

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. 

The final answer is [6].
