Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:

<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 10 total triangles in this graph. The final answer is [10].
