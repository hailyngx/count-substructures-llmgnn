Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by summing up the number of triangles each node is a part of. Let's calculate the number of triangles in this given graph.

We will list the triangles as follows:
- Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 4, 8.
- Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 2, 5, 6, 9.
- Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 1, 3, 6.
- Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, 5.
- Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 1, 3, 4, 8.
- Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, 3.
- Node 7 forms triangles with nodes 3, 8, 9.
- Node 8 forms triangles with nodes 0, 5, 7.
- Node 9 forms triangles with nodes 1, 7.

Therefore, listing the unique triangles, we have:
<0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 7, 8>

Counting the total number of triangles, we get the answer inside brackets:
