Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
