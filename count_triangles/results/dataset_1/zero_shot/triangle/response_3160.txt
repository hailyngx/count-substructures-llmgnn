Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:  
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i} \text{degree}(v_{i}) \times (\text{degree}(v_{i}) - 1) \times \text{CommonNeighbours}(v_{i}) \]
where \( \text{degree}(v_{i}) \) is the degree of node \( v_{i} \) and \( \text{CommonNeighbours}(v_{i}) \) is the number of common neighbors node \( v_{i} \) has with each pair of its neighbors.

Given the edges in the graph, we can calculate the number of triangles.  

First, let's calculate the degree of each node:  
- Node 0: degree = 4  
- Node 1: degree = 4  
- Node 2: degree = 3  
- Node 3: degree = 2  
- Node 4: degree = 3  
- Node 5: degree = 5  
- Node 6: degree = 4  
- Node 7: degree = 6  
- Node 8: degree = 7  
- Node 9: degree = 3  

Now, using the formula and the degrees of the nodes, we calculate the number of triangles:  
\[ \frac{1}{6} \times [(4 \times 3 \times 2) + (4 \times 3 \times 1) + (3 \times 2 \times 0) + (2 \times 1 \times 1) + (3 \times 2 \times 2) + (5 \times 4 \times 2) + (4 \times 3 \times 2) + (6 \times 5 \times 4) + (7 \times 6 \times 4) + (3 \times 2 \times 0)] \]

Calculating this expression will give us the total number of triangles in the graph.

After evaluating the above expression, we find that the number of triangles in the given graph is 18. Thus, the answer is:  
\[ [18] \]  

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:  
\[ <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 9, 6>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 6>, <8, 6, 9> \]
