Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. Let's count the number of triangles in the graph.

First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle 2: <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle 3: <1, 5, 4>
- Triangle 4: <1, 6, 5>
- Triangle 5: <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle 6: <1, 7, 4>
- Triangle 7: <2, 0, 8>
- Triangle 8: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 9: <4, 7, 5>
- Triangle 10: <8, 6, 2>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is 10. So, the final answer is [10].
