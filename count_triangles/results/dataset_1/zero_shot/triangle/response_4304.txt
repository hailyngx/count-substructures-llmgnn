Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles formed by connecting any three nodes among the 10 nodes. 

Upon examining the given graph's edges, the triangles can be identified as follows:
- <2, 6, 7>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <2, 7, 9>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph, where the unique triangles are <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>.
