Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, and <4, 7, 9> triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
