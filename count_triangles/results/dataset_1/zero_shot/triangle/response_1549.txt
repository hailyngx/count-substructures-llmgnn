Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 20 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 9, 5>
<8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
