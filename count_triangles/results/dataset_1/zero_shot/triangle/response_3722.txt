Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 1>
<4, 7, 8>

There are a total of 7 triangles. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
