Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 5>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
