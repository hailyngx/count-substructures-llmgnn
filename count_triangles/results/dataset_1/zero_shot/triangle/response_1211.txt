Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles can be counted by examining each possible triplet of nodes. However, in this case, we can simplify the process by observing the edges.

Looking at the edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 9 form a complete subgraph with multiple triangles. Let's list the triangles in this subgraph:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
