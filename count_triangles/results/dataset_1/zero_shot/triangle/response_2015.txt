Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph is equal to the number of unique paths of length 2 between nodes. To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can identify the unique triangles based on the given edges.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 9, 0>
<3, 7, 4>
[There are 7 triangles in total.]
