Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. Let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

The triangles found in this graph are:
<1, 2, 3>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<7, 2, 1>
<7, 1, 3>
<7, 2, 3>
<9, 4, 6>

Therefore, this graph contains 8 triangles in total. So, the final answer is [8].
