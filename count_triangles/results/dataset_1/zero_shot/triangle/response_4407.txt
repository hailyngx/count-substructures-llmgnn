Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 6, 7> 
<1, 2, 5> 
<1, 6, 9> 
<1, 3, 5> 
<1, 3, 9> 
<1, 5, 9> 
<2, 3, 5> 
<6, 8, 9> 
<6, 9, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
