Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [7] triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles are <1, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 8, 4>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 8, 4>, <4, 8, 1>.
