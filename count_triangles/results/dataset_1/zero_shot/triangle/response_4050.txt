Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes that form a triangle. 

After examining the provided edges, we find the following unique triangles:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
