Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles found in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <3, 7, 9>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
