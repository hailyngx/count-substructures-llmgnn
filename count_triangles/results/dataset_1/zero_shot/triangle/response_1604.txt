Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

[<2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 8, 9>]
