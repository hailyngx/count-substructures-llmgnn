Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are: <0, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 7, 8>, <5, 3, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
