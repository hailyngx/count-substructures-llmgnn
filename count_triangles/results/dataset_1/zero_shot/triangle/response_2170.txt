Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three interconnected nodes. Here, I will list the unique triangles found in the graph and then provide the final count of triangles.

The unique triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
