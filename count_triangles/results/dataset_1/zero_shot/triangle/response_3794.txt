Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, and <4, 6, 5>.
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
