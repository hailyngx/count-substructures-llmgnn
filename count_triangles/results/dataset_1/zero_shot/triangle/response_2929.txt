Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, and <6, 8, 9>.
