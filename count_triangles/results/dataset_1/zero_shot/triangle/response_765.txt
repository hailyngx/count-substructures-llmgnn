Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

- <0, 7, 6>
- <0, 9, 5>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
