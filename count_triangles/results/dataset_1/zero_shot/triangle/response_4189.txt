Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 6>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
