Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: <0, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>.
So, the final answer is [8].
