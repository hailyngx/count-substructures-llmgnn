Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 11 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows: <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <7, 6, 3>, <8, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 2>, <9, 5, 2>. 
Therefore, the final answer is [11].
