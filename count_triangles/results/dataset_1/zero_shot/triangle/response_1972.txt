Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 1>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<9, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
