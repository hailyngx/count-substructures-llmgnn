Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 7, 6>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 9, 2>.
