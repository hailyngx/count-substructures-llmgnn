Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [16] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 1, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 1, 2>
<6, 1, 3>
<6, 2, 3>
<8, 1, 3>
<8, 3, 9>
<9, 3, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
