Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
0----1       2----6
|           |     |
|           |     |
3----4----7----9
|     |     |
|     |     |
5     8     9
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles:
1. Nodes 3, 4, and 7 form a triangle. (<3, 4, 7>)
2. Nodes 2, 4, and 6 form a triangle. (<2, 4, 6>)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
