Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 9, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<1, 0, 4>
<3, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
