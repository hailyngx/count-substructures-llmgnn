Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [24] triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 8>]
