Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by counting the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After analyzing the graph, we can see that the triangles formed are as follows:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 8, 2>
<4, 8, 6>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 6. 

So, the answer in brackets is: [6].
