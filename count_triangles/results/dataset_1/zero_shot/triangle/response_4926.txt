Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 25 unique triangles in the given graph:

[<0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 6>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 8, 5>, <2, 8, 6>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [25].
