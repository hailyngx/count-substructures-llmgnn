Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [16].

The unique triangles are:
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 6>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 2>
<6, 8, 3>
<7, 9, 1>
<7, 9, 4>
<8, 6, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
