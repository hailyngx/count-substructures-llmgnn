Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 15 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: 

<0, 3, 2>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 0>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 9, 1>
<8, 1, 9>
<8, 5, 2>

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
