Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, and <1, 8, 9> triangles in the given graph.  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
