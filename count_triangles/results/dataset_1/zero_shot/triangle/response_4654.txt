Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
