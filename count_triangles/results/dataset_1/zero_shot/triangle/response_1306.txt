Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 9>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
