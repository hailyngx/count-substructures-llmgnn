Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for cycles of length 3 or triangles. 

Looking at the graph, we can observe the following triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 8, 2>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 2>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [8].
