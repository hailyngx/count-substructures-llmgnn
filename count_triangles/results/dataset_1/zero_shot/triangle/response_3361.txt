Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the given edges. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 6, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 8, 3>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
