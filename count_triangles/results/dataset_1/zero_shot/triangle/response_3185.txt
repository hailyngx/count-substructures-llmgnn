Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
