Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by looking at the triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Let's list down all the triangles:

<0, 1, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
