Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

[<0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 8>] 

So, the final answer is [5].
