Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph consists of the following triangles:

<0, 2, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>  

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
