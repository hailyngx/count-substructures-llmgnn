Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: 10
Therefore, the final answer is [10].
