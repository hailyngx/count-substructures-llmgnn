Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are total of 10 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<1, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 7>, <4, 2, 8>, <7, 6, 9>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 5, 6>]
