Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 9, 7>, and <4, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
