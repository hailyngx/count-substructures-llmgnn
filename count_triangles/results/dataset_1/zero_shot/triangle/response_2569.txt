Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 1>
<0, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 0>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 9, 0>
<1, 6, 5>
<6, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 0>
<5, 6, 7>
<9, 5, 7>
<9, 7, 5>

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
