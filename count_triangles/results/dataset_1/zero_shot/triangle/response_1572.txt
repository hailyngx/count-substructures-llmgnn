Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
