Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles: <5, 7, 9> <6, 7, 9> <6, 8, 9>.

Counting all the triangles in the graph, we find that there are [3] triangles in total.
