Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph.

The possible triangles in this graph are:
- <0, 4, 3>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 5, 1>
- <0, 5, 2>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 6, 3>
- <0, 7, 0>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <3, 4, 0>
- <5, 1, 8>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [10].
