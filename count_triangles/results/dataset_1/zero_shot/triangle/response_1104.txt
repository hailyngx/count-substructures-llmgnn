Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding how many triples of nodes are connected by either 3 edges (forming a triangle) or 2 edges (forming a triangle with one shared edge). 

In this graph, there are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 8>, and <5, 8, 4> that form triangles. 

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
