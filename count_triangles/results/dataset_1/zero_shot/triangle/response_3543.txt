Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in this graph. Here they are:

\[<1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 7, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 7>\]

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
