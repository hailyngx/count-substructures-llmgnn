Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are: 
<0, 3, 4>,
<0, 3, 5>,
<0, 4, 3>,
<3, 5, 8>,
<2, 8, 9>

So, the answer is [5].
