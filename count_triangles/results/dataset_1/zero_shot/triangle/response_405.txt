Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<1, 6, 2>
<1, 7, 0>
<1, 9, 4>
<1, 9, 5>
<2, 6, 1>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 9, 1>
<5, 9, 4>
<9, 5, 8>

There are a total of 9 triangles in the graph. So, the answer is [9].
