Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Thus, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph.  
So, the number of triangles in the graph is [10].
