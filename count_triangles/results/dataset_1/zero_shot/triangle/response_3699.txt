Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 8, 4>, <4, 6, 8>, and <6, 8, 4>.
