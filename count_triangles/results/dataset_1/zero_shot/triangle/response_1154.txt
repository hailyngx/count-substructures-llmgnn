Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are connected. Let's find the triangles in this graph:

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
