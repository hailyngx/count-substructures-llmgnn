Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 16 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:

<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 2, 8>
<6, 0, 9>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 3, 9>
<7, 4, 9>
<8, 5, 9>
<9, 0, 6>
<9, 0, 7>
<9, 3, 7>
<9, 7, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
