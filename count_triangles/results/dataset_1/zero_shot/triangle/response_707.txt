Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <1, 2, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, and <4, 6, 8>.
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
