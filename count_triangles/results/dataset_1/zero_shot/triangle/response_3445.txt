Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

In this case, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
<1, 2, 7> 
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
