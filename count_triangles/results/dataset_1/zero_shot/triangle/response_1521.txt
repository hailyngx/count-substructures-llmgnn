Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three edges. 

After examining the graph, we can identify the following unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
