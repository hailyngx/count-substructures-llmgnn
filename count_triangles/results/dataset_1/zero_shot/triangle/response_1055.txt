Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 8, 5>, <4, 8, 5>, <8, 6, 9>

There are a total of 8 triangles in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
