Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<3, 5, 7> 
<3, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
