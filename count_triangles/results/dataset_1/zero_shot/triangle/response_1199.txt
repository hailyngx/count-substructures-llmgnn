Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<2, 5, 3>, <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the graph.  
So, the final answer is [2].
