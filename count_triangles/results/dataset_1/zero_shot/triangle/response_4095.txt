Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
