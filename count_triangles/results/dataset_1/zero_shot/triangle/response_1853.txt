Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
