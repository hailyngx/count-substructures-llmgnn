Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 8, 3>
<2, 0, 4>
<3, 2, 0>
<4, 1, 0>
<4, 0, 8>
<6, 9, 8>
<8, 9, 6>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
