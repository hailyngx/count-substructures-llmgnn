Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<0, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 7, 0>
<7, 8, 0>
<7, 5, 0>
<7, 0, 5>
<5, 0, 7>
<1, 6, 3>
<7, 0, 8>
<8, 0, 7>
<5, 9, 0>
<9, 0, 5> 

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
