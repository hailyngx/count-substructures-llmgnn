Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Calculating the number of triangles in the given graph:
- Triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle <7, 8, 9>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
