Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 5>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
The final answer is [4].
