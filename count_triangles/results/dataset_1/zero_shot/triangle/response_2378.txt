Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 3>, <1, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 8, 4>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
