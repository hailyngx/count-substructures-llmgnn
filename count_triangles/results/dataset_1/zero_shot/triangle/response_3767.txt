Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 6>
<7, 6, 5> 

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
