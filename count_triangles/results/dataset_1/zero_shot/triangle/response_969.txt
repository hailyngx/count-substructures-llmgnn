Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 3>.
