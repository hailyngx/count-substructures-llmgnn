Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 9, 1>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 8, 7>
<1, 8, 4>
<1, 9, 7>
<1, 9, 3>
<2, 3, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 8, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 5, 4>
<6, 7, 0>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 0, 1>
<7, 0, 8>
<7, 1, 8>
<7, 1, 9>
<7, 4, 8>
<8, 0, 7>
<9, 0, 1>

Thus, the number of triangles in the given graph is [29].
