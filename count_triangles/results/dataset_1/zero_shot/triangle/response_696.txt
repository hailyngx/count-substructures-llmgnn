Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <0, 4, 2>, <5, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
