Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, and <3, 8, 9>. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
