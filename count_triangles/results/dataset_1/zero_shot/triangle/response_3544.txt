Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is part of. Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0 is part of 2 triangles: <0, 1, 3> and <0, 3, 9>.
- Node 1 is part of 4 triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, and <1, 5, 8>.
- Node 2 is part of 1 triangle: <1, 2, 5>.
- Node 3 is part of 4 triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <1, 2, 3>, <3, 5, 6>, and <3, 6, 7>.
- Node 4 is part of 0 triangles.
- Node 5 is part of 3 triangles: <2, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, and <1, 5, 8>.
- Node 6 is part of 2 triangles: <3, 5, 6> and <0, 3, 6>.
- Node 7 is part of 0 triangles.
- Node 8 is part of 1 triangle: <1, 5, 8>.
- Node 9 is part of 1 triangle: <0, 1, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <0, 3, 6>, <3, 6, 7>.
