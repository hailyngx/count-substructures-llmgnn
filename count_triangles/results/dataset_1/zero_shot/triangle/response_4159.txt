Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles present in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node participates in.

By observing the connections, we can find the following unique triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 7, 2>
<5, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
