Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be counted by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's calculate the number of triangles:

We can list the triangles found in the graph:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<8, 9, 1>
<8, 9, 3>

Count of triangles: 13

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
