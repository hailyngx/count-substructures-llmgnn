Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, and <7, 2, 5>.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
