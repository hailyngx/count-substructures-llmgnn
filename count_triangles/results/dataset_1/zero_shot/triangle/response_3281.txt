Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 5>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 8, 5>, <4, 7, 0>, <6, 5, 8>

There are 8 triangles in total. Therefore, the answer is [8].
