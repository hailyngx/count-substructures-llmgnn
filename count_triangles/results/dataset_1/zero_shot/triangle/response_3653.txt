Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are <2, 6, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.
