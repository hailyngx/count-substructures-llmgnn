Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
[<1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 5>, <3, 8, 4>, <1, 9, 3>, <1, 5, 6>, <3, 9, 7>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
