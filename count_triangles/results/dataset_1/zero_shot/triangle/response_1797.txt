Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 9, 8>, <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
