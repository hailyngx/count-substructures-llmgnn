Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 2>, <6, 7, 4>
Therefore, there are [13] triangles in total.
