Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 8>.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the graph.
