Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of unique paths of length 2 between nodes. Let's count the triangles in the given graph:

The possible triangles are:
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 9, 3>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 2>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 2>
<5, 7, 3>
<6, 4, 8>

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [17].
