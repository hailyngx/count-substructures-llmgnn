Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After analyzing the graph, we can list the unique triangles as follows:
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 9, 6>
<2, 1, 3>
<2, 1, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 1, 9>
<9, 6, 2>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. 
So, the final answer is: [10]
