Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [6].
