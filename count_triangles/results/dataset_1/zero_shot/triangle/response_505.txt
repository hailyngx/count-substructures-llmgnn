Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 7, 4>
<3, 0, 7>
<3, 0, 8>
<7, 0, 5>
<7, 0, 4>
<7, 6, 0>
<8, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the graph.
