Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <7, 5, 1>, <7, 1, 2>, <8, 0, 9>, <8, 7, 1>, <8, 7, 5>, <8, 7, 6>, <8, 3, 6>, <8, 3, 4>, <8, 6, 3>, <8, 6, 7>, <8, 6, 9>, <9, 0, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [23].
