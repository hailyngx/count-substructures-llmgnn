Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are: <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 7>. 
Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
