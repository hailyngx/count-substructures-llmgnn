Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented in the following way:

```
0 --- 1 --- 2
 \        /  |
  \      /   |
   > 4 --- 7 - 8
  / |     |   |
 /  |     |   |
6   9     3   |
 \        |   |
  \       |   |
   > 5 ---     |
        |______|
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

After examining the graph, we find that there are 7 triangles in total:
1. <1, 2, 7>
2. <1, 4, 7>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <2, 5, 6>
6. <3, 5, 7>
7. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
