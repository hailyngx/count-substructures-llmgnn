Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be formed by finding nodes that have edges connecting them to form a loop.

Here are the triangles found:  
<0, 4, 1>  
<0, 4, 2>  
<0, 4, 5>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<5, 4, 1>  
<5, 4, 2>  
<7, 4, 0>  
<7, 4, 2>  

Count of triangles: [8]
