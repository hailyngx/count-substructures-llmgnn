Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
