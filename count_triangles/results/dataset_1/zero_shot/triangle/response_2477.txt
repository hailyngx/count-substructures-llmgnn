Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 6, 5>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 7, 2>
<4, 7, 5>
<5, 7, 2>
<5, 7, 6>
<6, 7, 5>
<6, 7, 2>
<8, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in total.
