Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 1>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
