Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
Thus, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
