Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 4>, <4, 6, 7>

So there are [4] triangles in total.
