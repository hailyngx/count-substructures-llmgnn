Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by looking for each set of 3 nodes that are all pairwise connected by edges. 

Looking at the given graph:
- The node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
- The node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- The node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 7.
- The node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- The node 4 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- The node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- The node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9.
- The node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
- The node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- The node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.

Analyzing the given graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
