Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of triangles each node is involved in and then dividing the result by 6.

To find the triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges provided:

Triangles:
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 2>
<1, 8, 0>
<7, 8, 0>
<8, 9, 7>

Counting the number of triangles each node is involved in:
Node 0 is in 2 triangles
Node 1 is in 4 triangles
Node 2 is in 1 triangle
Node 5 is in 1 triangle
Node 6 is in 1 triangle
Node 7 is in 3 triangles
Node 8 is in 4 triangles
Node 9 is in 1 triangle

Calculating the total number of triangles:
(2 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1) / 6 = 16 / 6 = 2.6666

Therefore, there are only 2 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 5, 8> and <1, 6, 8>. Hence, the final answer is [2].
