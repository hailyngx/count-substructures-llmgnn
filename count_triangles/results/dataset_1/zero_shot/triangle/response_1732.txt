Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all unique combinations of 3 nodes that are connected by edges.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 1>
<5, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
