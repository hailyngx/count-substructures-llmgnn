Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 6>, <8, 9, 7>, <8, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 3>]
