Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.

Now, let's find the triangles in this graph:
- Triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle <0, 5, 3>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <3, 5, 7>
- Triangle <3, 8, 7>

Counting the triangles found, we get a total of 7 triangles.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
