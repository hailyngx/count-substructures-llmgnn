Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

<0, 1, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles is [10].
