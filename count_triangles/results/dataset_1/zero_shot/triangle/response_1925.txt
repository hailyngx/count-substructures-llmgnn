Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated. Let's list all the unique triangles present in the graph and count them to find the total number of triangles.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<4, 5, 7>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
