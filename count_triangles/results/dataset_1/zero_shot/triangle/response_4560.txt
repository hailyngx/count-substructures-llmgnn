Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
[<4, 1, 2>, <4, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <5, 3, 9>]   

The total number of triangles in the graph is 4.  
So, the final answer is [4].
