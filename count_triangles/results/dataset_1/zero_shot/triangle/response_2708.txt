Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 2>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 8, 5>, <6, 0, 2>, <6, 3, 7>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
