Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
[<1, 2, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 4, 6>, <8, 6, 7>]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in total.  
The final answer is: [4]
