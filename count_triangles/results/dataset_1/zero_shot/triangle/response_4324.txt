Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles formed by every set of 3 nodes that are connected to each other.

After examining the given graph, the triangles present are:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 11. 

The answer is: [11]
