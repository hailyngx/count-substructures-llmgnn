Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by checking each possible set of three nodes and seeing if they form a triangle.

After checking all possible triangles in the given graph, we find that there are 4 triangles in total.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
