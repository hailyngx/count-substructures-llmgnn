Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
