Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are: 
<0, 1, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<4, 9, 6>
<4, 9, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
