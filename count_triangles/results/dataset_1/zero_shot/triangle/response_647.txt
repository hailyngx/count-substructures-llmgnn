Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
[<0, 1, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 4, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, <9, 8, 1>, <9, 4, 6>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 5>, <6, 1, 8>, <4, 9, 6>, <1, 8, 9>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
