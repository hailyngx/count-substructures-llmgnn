Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [15].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<7, 6, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
