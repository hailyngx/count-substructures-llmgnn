Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<7, 9, 0>

There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
