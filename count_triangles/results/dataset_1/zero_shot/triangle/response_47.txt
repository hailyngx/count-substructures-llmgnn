Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, and <6, 7, 9>.
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
