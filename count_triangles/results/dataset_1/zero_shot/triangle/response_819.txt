Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated using the triangle counting formula. 

We can simply count the number of triangles by examining all unique triplets of nodes that are connected by edges. 

After analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
