Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by calculating the number of unique triangles formed by nodes connected by the given edges. 

After examining the given edges, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
