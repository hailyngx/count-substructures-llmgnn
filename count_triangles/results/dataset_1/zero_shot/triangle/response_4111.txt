Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles.

The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <1, 6, 5>, <2, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
