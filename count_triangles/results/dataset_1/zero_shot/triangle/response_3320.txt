Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 9, 2>
<4, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
