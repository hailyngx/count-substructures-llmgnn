Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 2>, <2, 8, 4>, <2, 8, 5>, <2, 9, 4>, <5, 1, 9>, <5, 7, 5>, <5, 8, 4>, <5, 8, 9>, <7, 5, 9>, <8, 4, 9>, <9, 3, 9>, <9, 4, 8>, <9, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
