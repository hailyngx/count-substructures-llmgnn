Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph is 7. The unique triangles are <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 9, 1>, <2, 0, 6>, <5, 3, 9>, and <6, 7, 4>. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
