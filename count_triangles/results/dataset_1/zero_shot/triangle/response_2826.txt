Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 7> 
<0, 2, 4>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in total. 

So, the final answer is [3].
