Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
- <0, 5, 1>
- <0, 5, 3>
- <0, 8, 7>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <0, 9, 4>
- <1, 5, 3>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 9, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
