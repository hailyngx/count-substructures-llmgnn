Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 4>
<4, 7, 1>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 1, 9>
<7, 1, 9>
<7, 6, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [8].
