Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
