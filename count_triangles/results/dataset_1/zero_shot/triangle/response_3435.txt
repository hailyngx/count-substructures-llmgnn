Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by identifying all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the unique triangles present in the graph:

[<2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
