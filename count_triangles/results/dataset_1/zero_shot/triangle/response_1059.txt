Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in this graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<0, 1, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 4, 9>
<0, 9, 3>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
