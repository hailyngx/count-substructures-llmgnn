Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangle in a graph is a set of three nodes where each pair of nodes is connected by an edge. Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 1>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 7, 5>
5. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 6, 3>
7. Triangle <4, 8, 7>
8. Triangle <4, 8, 9>
9. Triangle <7, 5, 1>
10. Triangle <7, 5, 9>
11. Triangle <7, 8, 9>
12. Triangle <9, 4, 8>
13. Triangle <9, 7, 5>

Hence, there are a total of 13 unique triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [13].
