Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [7] triangles in the given graph: <0, 2, 4>, <3, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 9>.
