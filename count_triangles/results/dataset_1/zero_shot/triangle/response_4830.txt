Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 3, 6>, <6, 4, 5>, <0, 9, 8>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
