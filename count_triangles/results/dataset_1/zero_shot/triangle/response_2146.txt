Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 3 triangles in the given graph. [3]
