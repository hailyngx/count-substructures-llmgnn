Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by examining the nodes and edges. 

Looking at the provided graph, we can list the triangles:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 8>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
