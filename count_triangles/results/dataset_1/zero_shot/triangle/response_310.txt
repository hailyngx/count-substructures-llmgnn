Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 5, 0>
<8, 6, 9>
<8, 9, 0>
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
