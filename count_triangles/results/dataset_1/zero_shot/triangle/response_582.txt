Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 8), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 5), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 1)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph.
