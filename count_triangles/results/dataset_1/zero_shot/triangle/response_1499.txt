Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is involved in. Here is the count for each node:

Node 0 is involved in 1 triangle.
Node 1 is involved in 2 triangles.
Node 2 is involved in 4 triangles.
Node 3 is involved in 4 triangles.
Node 4 is involved in 5 triangles.
Node 5 is involved in 1 triangle.
Node 6 is involved in 1 triangle.
Node 7 is involved in 2 triangles.
Node 8 is involved in 1 triangle.
Node 9 is involved in 4 triangles.

Adding up these counts, we get a total of 25 triangles in the graph.

So, the final answer is:
[25]
