Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <8, 1, 9>

Therefore, there are 14 unique triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
