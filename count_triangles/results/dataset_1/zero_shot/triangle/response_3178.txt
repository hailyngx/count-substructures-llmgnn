Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [10] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, and <5, 8, 9>.
