Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 15 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 8, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 9, 7>
<3, 5, 2>
<3, 5, 2>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 4>
<6, 8, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
