Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of [24] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 0, 5>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 2, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 0>
<3, 4, 2>
<4, 0, 5>
<4, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 6>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 8, 6>
<1, 8, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<8, 6, 7> 

Therefore, the final answer is [24].
