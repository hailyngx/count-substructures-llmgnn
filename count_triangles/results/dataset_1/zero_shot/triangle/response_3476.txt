Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles that can be formed using the given edges. 

After examining the given edges, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, and <2, 3, 9>.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
