Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
