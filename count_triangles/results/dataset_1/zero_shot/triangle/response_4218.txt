Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <3, 4, 5>
6. <8, 1, 9>
7. <8, 5, 9>
  
Therefore, there are 7 triangles in total. [7]
