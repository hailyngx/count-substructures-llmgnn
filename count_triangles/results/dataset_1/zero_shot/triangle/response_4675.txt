Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 8)
- Triangle 2: (2, 5, 6)
- Triangle 3: (2, 6, 7)
- Triangle 4: (2, 6, 9)
- Triangle 5: (2, 7, 8)
- Triangle 6: (2, 8, 9)
- Triangle 7: (6, 7, 8)
- Triangle 8: (6, 8, 9)
- Triangle 9: (7, 8, 9)

So there are a total of 9 triangles present in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
