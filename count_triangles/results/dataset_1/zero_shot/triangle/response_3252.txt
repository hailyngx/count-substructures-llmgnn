Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, the final answer is: [5].
