Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by identifying all possible triangles formed by the edges provided. 

Looking at the graph and its edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 8, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<6, 5, 8>
<6, 5, 2>
<6, 5, 8>
<6, 8, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
