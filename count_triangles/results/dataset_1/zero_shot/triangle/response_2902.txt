Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining the number of triangles each node is a part of. 

Looking at the graph, we can identify the following triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 4: <1, 2, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle 6: <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle 7: <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle 8: <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total in the given graph. 
The answer is [8].
