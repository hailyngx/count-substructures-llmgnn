Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are as follows:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 5, 4>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 7, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
