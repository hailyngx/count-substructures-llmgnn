Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
