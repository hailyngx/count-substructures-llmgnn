Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 6, 7>
3. <1, 5, 6>
4. <2, 3, 6>
5. <3, 5, 6>
6. <6, 7, 9>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
