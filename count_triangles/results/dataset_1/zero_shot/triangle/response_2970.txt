Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 1    4 -- 5 -- 9
|         |
2         8
|         |
```

Let's count the number of triangles in this graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

There are two triangles in this graph: <0, 1, 2> and <4, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
