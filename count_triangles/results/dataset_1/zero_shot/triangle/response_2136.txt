Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [4]. 

The unique triangles are: <0, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 8>.
