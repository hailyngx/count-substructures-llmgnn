Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 4>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 9>.
