Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
