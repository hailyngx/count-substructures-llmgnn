Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are total of 10 unique triangles.
So, the final answer is [10].
