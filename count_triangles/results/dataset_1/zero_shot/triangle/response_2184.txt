Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in total. So, the answer is [6].
