Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of. 

Upon examining the given graph, the triangles can be represented by the following sets of nodes:
<1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 7>

Thus, there are 2 triangles in the given graph, and the final answer is [2].
