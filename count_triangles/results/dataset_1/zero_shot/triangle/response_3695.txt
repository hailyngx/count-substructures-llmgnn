Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
<6, 7, 8>
<1, 6, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
