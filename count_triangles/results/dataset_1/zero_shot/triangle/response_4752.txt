Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in this graph. Here they are listed below:

[<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 7, 0>, <8, 5, 3>]
