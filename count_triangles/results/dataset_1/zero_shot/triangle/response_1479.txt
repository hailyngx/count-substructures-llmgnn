Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
