Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. 

After examining the provided edges, we can identify the following triangles in the graph: 
<1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 7, 6>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 5, 1>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 5>, <2, 7, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 1, 2>, <5, 1, 3>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 2, 1>, <5, 2, 3>, <5, 2, 9>, <5, 3, 1>, <5, 3, 2>, <5, 3, 9>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 2>, <5, 6, 3>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 9, 2>, <5, 9, 3>, <6, 1, 2>, <6, 1, 5>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 2, 1>, <6, 2, 5>, <6, 2, 7>, <6, 2, 3>, <6, 2, 5>, <6, 2, 7>, <6, 3, 5>, <6, 3, 2>, <6, 3, 7>, <6, 3, 5>, <6, 7, 1>, <6, 7, 2>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 7, 2>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 7, 5>, <7, 1, 6>, <7, 2, 6>, <7, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles formed by the given graph is [53].
