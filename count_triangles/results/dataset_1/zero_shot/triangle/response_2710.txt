Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated using the formula for counting triangles in an undirected graph:

Number of triangles = (1/6) * tr(G)^3

Where tr(G) is the total number of triangles containing vertex v, and tr(G) can be calculated using the formula:

tr(G) = 1/2 * [sum(d(v)^2 - deg(v))]

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

For node 0:
d(0) = 2
tr(G) = 1/2 * [(2^2) - 2] = 1

For node 1:
d(1) = 4
tr(G) = 1/2 * [(4^2) - 4] = 6

For node 2:
d(2) = 4
tr(G) = 1/2 * [(4^2) - 4] = 6

For node 3:
d(3) = 4
tr(G) = 1/2 * [(4^2) - 4] = 6

For node 4:
d(4) = 4
tr(G) = 1/2 * [(4^2) - 4] = 6

For node 5:
d(5) = 2
tr(G) = 1/2 * [(2^2) - 2] = 1

For node 6:
d(6) = 2
tr(G) = 1/2 * [(2^2) - 2] = 1

For node 7:
d(7) = 2
tr(G) = 1/2 * [(2^2) - 2] = 1

For node 8:
d(8) = 4
tr(G) = 1/2 * [(4^2) - 4] = 6

For node 9:
d(9) = 4
tr(G) = 1/2 * [(4^2) - 4] = 6

Adding up all the tr(G) values:
Total triangles = 1 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 6 = 34

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [34].

Now, let's list the unique triangles found:
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 9, 2>
<3, 9, 2>
<2, 9, 4>
<3, 4, 2>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 9, 2>
<4, 5, 6>
<7, 1, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 8, 9>

Thus, the final answer is [34].
