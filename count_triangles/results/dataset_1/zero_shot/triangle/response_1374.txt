Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 7, 2>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 9, 3>
<6, 8, 3>
<8, 5, 0>
<8, 6, 0>
<9, 4, 1>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
