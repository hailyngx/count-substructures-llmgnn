Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<[0, 2, 3], [0, 4, 6], [2, 4, 5], [4, 5, 6], [0, 4, 8], [0, 6, 8], [2, 4, 8], [4, 6, 8], [4, 6, 9], [4, 5, 6]>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
