Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes in the graph.

The triangles and their nodes are as follows:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 7, 2>
<3, 5, 8>
<5, 8, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 4>
<2, 7, 2>
<5, 8, 4>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
