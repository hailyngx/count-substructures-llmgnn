Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by examining the triangles formed by each set of three nodes connected by edges. 

After analyzing the given graph, the triangles formed are:
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<6, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. 

The final answer is: [10]
