Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be computed by finding the number of triangles each node participates in. Here are the triangles formed in the given graph:

<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph: [9].
