Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <1, 0, 9>
6. <3, 5, 9>
7. <3, 6, 9>
8. <4, 7, 9>
9. <7, 2, 9>
10. <7, 4, 9>
11. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
