Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all the triangles each node is part of. Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0 is not part of any triangle.
- Node 1 is part of the following triangles: <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>.
- Node 2 is part of the following triangles: <2, 7, 9>.
- Node 4 is part of the following triangles: <1, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 6>.
- Node 5 is part of the following triangles: <1, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>.
- Node 6 is part of the following triangles: <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 9>.
- Node 7 is part of the following triangles: <1, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>.
- Node 8 is part of the following triangles: <1, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <7, 6, 9>.
- Node 9 is part of the following triangles: <2, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 6, 9>.

Counting the unique triangles found for each node, we get a total of 10 unique triangles in the graph:
<1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
