Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can form the following triangles:
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 0>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [5].
