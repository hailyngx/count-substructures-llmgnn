Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. Here are the triangles in the graph: <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 4>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 1>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 9, 7>.

Therefore, the answer is [9].
