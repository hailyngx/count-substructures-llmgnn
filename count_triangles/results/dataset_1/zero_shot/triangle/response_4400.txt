Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<9, 6, 4>
<9, 6, 7>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
