Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 4>
<1, 7, 0>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 2, 9>
<4, 9, 8>

So, there are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
