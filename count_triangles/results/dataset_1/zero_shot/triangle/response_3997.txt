Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
