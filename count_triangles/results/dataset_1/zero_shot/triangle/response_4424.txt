Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in this graph. Here they are in the format <node1, node2, node3>:

<3, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
