Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are represented by the nodes they contain:
[<0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 3>] 
So, the final answer is [5].
