Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 0, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <8, 3, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
