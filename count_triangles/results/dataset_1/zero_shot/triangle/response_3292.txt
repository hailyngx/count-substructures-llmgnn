Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by looking at the possible triangles formed by the nodes and edges. Let's find the unique triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <3, 6, 9>
5. Triangle <5, 6, 9>
6. Triangle <5, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <6, 7, 9>
8. Triangle <8, 4, 9>

Count of triangles = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
