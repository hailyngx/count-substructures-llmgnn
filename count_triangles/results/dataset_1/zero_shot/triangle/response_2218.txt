Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 9, 2>
<3, 6, 0>
<3, 7, 8>
<8, 3, 6> 

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
