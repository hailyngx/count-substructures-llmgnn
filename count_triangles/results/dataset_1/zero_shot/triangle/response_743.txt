Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
