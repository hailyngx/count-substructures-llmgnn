Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<4, 9, 7>
<4, 9, 8>
<6, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
