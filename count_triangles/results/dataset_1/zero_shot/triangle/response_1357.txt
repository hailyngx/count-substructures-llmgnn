Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 1>
<8, 2, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
