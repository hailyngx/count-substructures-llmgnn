Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining all possible combinations of three vertices that are connected by edges. Here is the list of unique triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 3, 4>
4. <0, 7, 8>
5. <1, 6, 8>
6. <2, 4, 6>
7. <2, 4, 5>
8. <3, 4, 5>
9. <3, 4, 9>
10. <4, 5, 6>
11. <4, 5, 9>
12. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
