Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 2>
<4, 6, 9>

Thus, the final answer is [7].
