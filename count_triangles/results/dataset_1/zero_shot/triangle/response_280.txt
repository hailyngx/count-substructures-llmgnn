Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 9, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 5>, <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: 9
