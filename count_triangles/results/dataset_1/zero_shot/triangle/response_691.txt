Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 0>
<3, 7, 1>
<3, 7, 2>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
