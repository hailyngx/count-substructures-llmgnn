Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph.  
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 2>, <1, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 1, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <1, 8, 9>.
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
