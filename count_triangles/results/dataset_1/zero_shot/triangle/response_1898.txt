Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining each set of 3 nodes to see if they form a triangle. Here is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:

<1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
