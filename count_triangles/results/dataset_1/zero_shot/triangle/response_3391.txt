Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 1>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 0>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <9, 4, 0>.

There are [10] triangles in total.
