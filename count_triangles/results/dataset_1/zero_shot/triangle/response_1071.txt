Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
