Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: 

<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 8, 4>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 3, 6>
<5, 3, 8>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 1, 8>
<6, 3, 5>
<6, 3, 8>
<6, 5, 8>
<6, 7, 1>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 1, 6>
<8, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
