Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
