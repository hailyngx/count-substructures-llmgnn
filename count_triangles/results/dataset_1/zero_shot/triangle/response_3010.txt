Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 9, 8>

There are 10 triangles in total.  
Therefore, the final answer is [10].
