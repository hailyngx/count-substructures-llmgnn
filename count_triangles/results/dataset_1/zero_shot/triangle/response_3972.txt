Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: 

<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<6, 4, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [8].
