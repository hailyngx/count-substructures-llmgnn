Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 9, 2>
<4, 9, 5>
<4, 9, 7>
<6, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<9, 1, 0>

There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
