Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the given edges. 

The triangles in the graph are:
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 5, 1>
<8, 3, 9>

Since the triangles <2, 5, 6> and <2, 5, 9> share the edge (2, 5), and the remaining triangles are unique, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
