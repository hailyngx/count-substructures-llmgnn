Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, and <1, 4, 8>.
    
    There are 3 triangles in total. Hence, the answer is [3].
