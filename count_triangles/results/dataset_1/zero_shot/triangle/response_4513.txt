Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 9, 5>
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 3, 8>
<4, 7, 2>
<9, 1, 8>
<9, 1, 0>
<9, 6, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
