Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 2>, <2, 4, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, and <7, 9, 4>.
