Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
