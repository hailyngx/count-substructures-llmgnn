Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 4>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 0, 1>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 0, 9>
<6, 0, 4>
<8, 1, 4>
<8, 3, 9>
<8, 4, 9>
<9, 4, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [17] triangles in the given graph.
