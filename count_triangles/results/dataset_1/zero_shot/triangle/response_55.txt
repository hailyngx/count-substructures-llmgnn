Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:    

<0, 3, 5>    
<3, 7, 9>    
<5, 7, 9>    

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
