Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 11 unique triangles in this graph:

[<0, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 8>]
