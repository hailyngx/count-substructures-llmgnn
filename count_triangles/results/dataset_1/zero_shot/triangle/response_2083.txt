Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
