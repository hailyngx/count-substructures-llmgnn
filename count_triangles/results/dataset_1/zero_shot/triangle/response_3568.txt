Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=0}^{n} d_i(d_i-1)(d_i-2) \]

Where \( d_i \) represents the degree of node i and n is the total number of nodes.

Let's calculate the number of triangles:

\[
\begin{align*}
d_0 &= 1 \\
d_1 &= 7 \\
d_2 &= 3 \\
d_3 &= 4 \\
d_4 &= 2 \\
d_5 &= 3 \\
d_6 &= 1 \\
d_7 &= 2 \\
d_8 &= 7 \\
d_9 &= 2 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Plugging these values into the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \left( 1(0)(-1) + 7(6)(5) + 3(2)(1) + 4(3)(2) + 2(1)(0) + 3(2)(1) + 1(0)(-1) + 2(1)(0) + 7(6)(5) + 2(1)(0) \right)
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{6} \left(0 + 210 + 6 + 24 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 210 + 0\right)
\]

\[
= \frac{456}{6}
\]

\[
= 76
\]

Hence, there are 76 triangles present in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [76].
