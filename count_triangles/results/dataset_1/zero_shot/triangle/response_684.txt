Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 4>
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 1, 9>
<4, 2, 8>
<4, 3, 8>
<8, 0, 9>

There are 10 triangles in total. 
Therefore, the final answer is [10].
