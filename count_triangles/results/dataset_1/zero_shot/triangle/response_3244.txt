Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
