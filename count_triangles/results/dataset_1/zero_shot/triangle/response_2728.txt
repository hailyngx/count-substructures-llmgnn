Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of triangles formed by every set of three connected nodes.

The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 6>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <7, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
