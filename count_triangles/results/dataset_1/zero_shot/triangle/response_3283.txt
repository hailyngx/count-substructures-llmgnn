Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by calculating the number of closed loops of length 3. 

Upon examining the given graph with the nodes and edges provided, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 6>

Hence, there are [9] triangles in the given graph, as shown in the list above.
