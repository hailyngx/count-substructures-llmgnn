Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node can form and then dividing by 3 since each triangle is counted three times (one for each node in the triangle). Let's calculate the number of triangles:

Node 0 can form 1 triangle: <0, 1, 2>  
Node 1 can form 1 triangle: <1, 2, 7>  
Node 2 can form 1 triangle: <0, 1, 2>  
Node 3 cannot form any triangle.  
Node 4 cannot form any triangle.  
Node 5 cannot form any triangle.  
Node 6 cannot form any triangle.  
Node 7 can form 2 triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <1, 4, 7>  
Node 8 cannot form any triangle.  

Adding up the triangles from each node, we have 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 triangles.  
Dividing by 3 (as each triangle is counted thrice), we get 5 / 3 = 1.6666...

Therefore, the final answer is [1]. The unique triangle found is <0, 1, 2>.
