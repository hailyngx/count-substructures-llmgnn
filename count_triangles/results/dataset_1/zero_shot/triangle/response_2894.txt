Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 9, 4>, <5, 6, 7>, <8, 9, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
