Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be found by checking each possible set of 3 vertices to see if they form a triangle. Here, I will list out the unique triangles found in the given graph:

1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 2, 4>
3. <2, 3, 9>
4. <2, 6, 9>
5. <2, 8, 9>
6. <3, 5, 7>
7. <3, 7, 9>
8. <4, 1, 8>
9. <6, 2, 9>
10. <8, 2, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [10].
