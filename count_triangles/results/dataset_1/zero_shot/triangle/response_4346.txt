Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
- (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 6), (8, 6)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

There are 3 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 4, 3>, <3, 6, 0>, <4, 5, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
