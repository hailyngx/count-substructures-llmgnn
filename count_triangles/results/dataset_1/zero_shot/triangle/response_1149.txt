Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles in the graph are:
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 3>
<4, 6, 3>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>

There are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
