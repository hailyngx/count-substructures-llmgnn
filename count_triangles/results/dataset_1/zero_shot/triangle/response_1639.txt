Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 9, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 5>, <0, 2, 9>.
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
