Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by three connected nodes.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 9, 4>
<6, 2, 4>
<9, 5, 4>
<9, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
