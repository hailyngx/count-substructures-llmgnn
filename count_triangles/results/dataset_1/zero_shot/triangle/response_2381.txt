Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

[<1, 9, 5> <1, 9, 6> <1, 6, 3> <1, 6, 7> <0, 2, 5>]  

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in total in the given graph.
