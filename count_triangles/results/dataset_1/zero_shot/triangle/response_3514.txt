Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected by edges.

Upon examining the graph based on the given edges, we find the following triangles:
1. <1, 3, 7>
2. <2, 6, 7>
3. <2, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
