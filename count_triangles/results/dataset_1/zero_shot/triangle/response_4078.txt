Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The following triangles can be found in the graph:
<1, 2, 9>, <3, 1, 2>, <3, 1, 9>, <3, 2, 9>, <4, 3, 1>, <4, 3, 9>, <4, 3, 2>, <4, 3, 7>, <4, 9, 2>, <4, 9, 6>, <4, 9, 8>, <4, 2, 9>, <5, 0, 9>, <9, 6, 5>, <9, 5, 0>, <9, 5, 2>, <9, 5, 6>, <9, 5, 8>, <9, 6, 4>, <9, 8, 6>, <9, 8, 4>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [21].
