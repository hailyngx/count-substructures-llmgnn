Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph:
[<1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 6>, <3, 0, 1>, <3, 1, 4>, <3, 1, 6>, <3, 6, 4>, <4, 5, 2>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 2, 1>, <5, 4, 6>]
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
