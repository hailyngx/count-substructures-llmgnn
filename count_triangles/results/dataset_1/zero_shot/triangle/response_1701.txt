Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph = 4
The unique triangles found in the graph are <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, and <1, 2, 6>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
