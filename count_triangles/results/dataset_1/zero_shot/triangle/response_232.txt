Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated using the number of connected triples of nodes. A triangle in a graph consists of 3 nodes connected to each other forming a closed loop.

From the given information, the graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. To count the number of triangles, we need to identify the connected triples of nodes in the graph based on the provided edges.

Count of triangles in the given graph: [6]

Unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<0, 6, 5>
