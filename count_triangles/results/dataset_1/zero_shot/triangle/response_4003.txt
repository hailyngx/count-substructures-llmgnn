Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By examining the edges, we can see that the triangles in this graph are formed by the following sets of nodes:
<0, 6, 4>
<1, 2, 5>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles found are <0, 6, 4> and <1, 2, 5>.
