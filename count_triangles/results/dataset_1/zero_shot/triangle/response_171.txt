Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 30 edges connecting the 10 nodes in the given graph. To identify the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. Let's go ahead and find the triangles.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 9>

There are 10 unique triangles in the graph, thus the final answer is [10].
