Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, and <4, 6, 7>.  
Therefore, the final answer is [7].
