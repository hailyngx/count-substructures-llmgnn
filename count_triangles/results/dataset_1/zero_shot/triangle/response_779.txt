Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 12 triangles. The unique triangles are:

<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 0, 8>
<6, 2, 8>
<7, 0, 8>
<7, 3, 8>
<8, 0, 3>
<8, 5, 9>
<8, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
