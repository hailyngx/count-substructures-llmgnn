Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be found by counting all unique combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges. 

By observation, here are the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
