Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted as follows:

Let's list out the triangles based on the given edges:

<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 1, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<7, 9, 3>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the graph. 

The answer is: [10]
