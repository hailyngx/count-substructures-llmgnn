Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 8, 9>
The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
