Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of triangles each node is involved in and then dividing by 3 (since each triangle involves 3 nodes). 

After analyzing the given graph, the triangles in the graph are: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, and <4, 6, 7>. 

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
