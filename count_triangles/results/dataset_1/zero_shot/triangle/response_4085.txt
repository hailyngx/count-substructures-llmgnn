Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are as follows: 
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 0>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 8, 5>
<2, 0, 4>
<5, 1, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
