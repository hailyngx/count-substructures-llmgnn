Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 5>
<1, 7, 1>
<1, 7, 7>
<3, 3, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
