Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 4>, <5, 4, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
