Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets []:

[<0, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 4, 6>]
