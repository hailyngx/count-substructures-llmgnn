Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 8>.  
There are 4 triangles in total.  
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
