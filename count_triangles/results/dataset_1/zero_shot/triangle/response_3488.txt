Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are total of 14 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <0, 9, 1>, <4, 3, 7>, <1, 8, 4>, <1, 9, 2>, <4, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
