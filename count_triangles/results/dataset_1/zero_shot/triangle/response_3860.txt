Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 7, 4>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<7, 6, 4>
<8, 0, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] triangles in the graph.
