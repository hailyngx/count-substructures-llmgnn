Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 4.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
