Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the graph are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.
 
There are 8 triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
