Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [7] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, and <5, 9, 6>.
