Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
