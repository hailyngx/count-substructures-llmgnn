Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles: 

<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 2, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
