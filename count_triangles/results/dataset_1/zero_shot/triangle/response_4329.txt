Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 9>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
