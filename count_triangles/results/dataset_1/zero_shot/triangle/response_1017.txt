Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The possible triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 6, 5>
<1, 3, 0>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 8, 6>
<3, 1, 5>
<4, 1, 5>
<4, 7, 6>
<5, 0, 6>
<5, 1, 3>
<5, 6, 0>
<6, 0, 5>
<6, 7, 4>

There are total of 14 triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [14].
