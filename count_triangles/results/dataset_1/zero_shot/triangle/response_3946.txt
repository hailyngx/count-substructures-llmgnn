Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by sets of three connected nodes. 

After examining the graph, the triangles are as follows:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <4, 1, 9>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
