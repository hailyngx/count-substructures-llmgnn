Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are <1, 5, 7>, <3, 2, 8>, and <5, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
