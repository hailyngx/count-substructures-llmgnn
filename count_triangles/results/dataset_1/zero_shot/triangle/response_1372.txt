Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [18] triangles in the given graph. 

Unique triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 9, 6>, <1, 7, 2>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 0, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 3, 6>, <6, 7, 9>
