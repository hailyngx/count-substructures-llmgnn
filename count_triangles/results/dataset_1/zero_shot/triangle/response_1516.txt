Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
We will count the number of triangles in the given graph.

A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected in a closed loop. Let's first list all the unique triangles present in the graph:

<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<6, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the number of triangles:
