Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
