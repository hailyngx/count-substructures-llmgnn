Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 9, 2>
<6, 8, 3>
<9, 5, 0>

There are a total of 8 triangles in the graph. So, the final answer is [8].
