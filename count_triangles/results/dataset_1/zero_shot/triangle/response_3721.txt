Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is [4] and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 9>.
