Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: 
<2, 5, 8> 
<2, 8, 9> 
<2, 9, 3> 
<5, 2, 8> 
<5, 8, 9> 
<5, 9, 2> 
<8, 2, 9> 
<8, 9, 5> 

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
