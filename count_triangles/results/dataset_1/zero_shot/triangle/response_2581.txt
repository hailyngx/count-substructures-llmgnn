Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. 
The triangles are <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, and <6, 8, 9>.
