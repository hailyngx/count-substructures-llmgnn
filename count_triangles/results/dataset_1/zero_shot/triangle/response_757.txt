Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 2, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in total. 
The final answer is [3].
