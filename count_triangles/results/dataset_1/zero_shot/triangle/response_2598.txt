Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by looking at each triplet of nodes and checking if there are edges between all three nodes (forming a triangle). Let's go ahead and count the number of triangles for the given graph:

[<0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 9, 6>, <0, 7, 5>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>]

Count: [11]
