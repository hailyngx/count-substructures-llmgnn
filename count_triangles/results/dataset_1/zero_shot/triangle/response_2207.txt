Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
