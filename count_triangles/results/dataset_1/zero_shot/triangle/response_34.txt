Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:

<1, 3, 5>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 9, 2>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
