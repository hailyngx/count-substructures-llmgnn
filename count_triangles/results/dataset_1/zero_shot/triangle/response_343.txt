Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 9>
