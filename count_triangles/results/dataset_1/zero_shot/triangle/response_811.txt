Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be formed by selecting three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 0, 8>
5. Triangle <9, 0, 8>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 8, 9>
8. Triangle <4, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [8].
