Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] unique triangles in the graph:

[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 0>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 7, 5>]
