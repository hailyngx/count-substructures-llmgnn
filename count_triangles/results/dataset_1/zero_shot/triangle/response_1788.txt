Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 0, 5>, <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
