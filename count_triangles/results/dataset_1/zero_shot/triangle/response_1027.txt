Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are as follows: 
<0, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 9, 0>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 0, 9>, <4, 6, 2>, <4, 7, 1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
