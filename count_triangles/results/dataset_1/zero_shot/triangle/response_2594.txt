Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is 3 which can be represented as follows: 

[<1, 2, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>]
