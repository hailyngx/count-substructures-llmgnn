Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
