Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
