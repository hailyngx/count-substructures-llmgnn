Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 6>, <7, 6, 2>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
