Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 8, 5>
<4, 9, 7>
<4, 9, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
