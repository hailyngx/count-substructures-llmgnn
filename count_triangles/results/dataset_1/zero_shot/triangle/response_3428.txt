Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are:

<6, 8, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>

So, the final answer is [4].
