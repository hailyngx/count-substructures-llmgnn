Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, and <0, 7, 1>.

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
