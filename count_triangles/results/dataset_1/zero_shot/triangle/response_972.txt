Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 6>
There are 5 triangles present in the given graph.
Therefore, the answer is [5].
