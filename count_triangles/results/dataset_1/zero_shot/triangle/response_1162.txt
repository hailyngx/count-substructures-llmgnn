Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
