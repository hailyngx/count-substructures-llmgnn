Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of. 

After reviewing the given edges, the following triangles can be identified:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
