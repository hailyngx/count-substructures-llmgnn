Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
