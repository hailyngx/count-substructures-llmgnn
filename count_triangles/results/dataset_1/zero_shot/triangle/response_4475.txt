Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the graph are as follows: 

<p>(1, 3, 7)</p>
<p>(1, 3, 9)</p>
<p>(1, 6, 9)</p>
<p>(2, 3, 4)</p>

There are 4 triangles in total. 

Therefore, the answer is: [4].
