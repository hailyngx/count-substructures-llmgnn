Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 8.
The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 3>, <0, 3, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
