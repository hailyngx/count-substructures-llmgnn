Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with its nodes and edges to have a better visual understanding.  

The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 -- 1 -- 2
 \       /
  5 -- 8
   \  / 
    9
    
3 -- 8 -- 6 -- 4
```

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph.

There are 4 triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <6, 8, 3>
4. <0, 5, 9>

So, the final answer is: [4].
