Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be formed by finding cycles of length 3. We can identify the following unique triangles:

<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 9>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
