Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<3, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
