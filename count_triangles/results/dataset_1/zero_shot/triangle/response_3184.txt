Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph consists of the following edges:
- 0: (1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- 1: (0, 2, 8, 9)
- 2: (1, 5)
- 4: (0)
- 5: (2, 6, 7, 8)
- 6: (0, 5)
- 7: (0, 5)
- 8: (0, 1, 5)
- 9: (0, 1)

Now let's find the triangles in this graph:

There is one triangle: <0, 1, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
