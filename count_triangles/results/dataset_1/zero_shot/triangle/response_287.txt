Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 8, 3>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, and <5, 6, 7>.
