Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of unique paths of length 2 between three distinct nodes. 

In this given graph, the triangles are:

<0, 2, 3>
<0, 5, 3>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 7, 3>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 1, 7>
<5, 0, 3>
<5, 3, 9>
<6, 4, 1>
<6, 5, 9>
<7, 1, 4>
<8, 2, 1>
<9, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [16].
