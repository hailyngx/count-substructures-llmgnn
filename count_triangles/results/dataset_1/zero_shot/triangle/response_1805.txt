Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles are as follows: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 7, 3>, <3, 5, 1>.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
