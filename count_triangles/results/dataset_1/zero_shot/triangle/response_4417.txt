Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<[0, 3, 6], [0, 3, 8], [0, 4, 7], [1, 5, 6], [1, 5, 9], [1, 8, 3], [2, 4, 7], [4, 7, 2]>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [8].
