Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <2, 9, 5>, <2, 9, 8>, <2, 9, 1>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <1, 9, 5>.
