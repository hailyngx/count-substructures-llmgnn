Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
In order to find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes and edges provided:

1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <2, 3, 6>
3. <3, 5, 9>
4. <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
