Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by looking at how many sets of three nodes are fully connected with edges. Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle: <2, 0, 4>
2. Triangle: <2, 1, 4>
3. Triangle: <2, 4, 7>
4. Triangle: <2, 4, 9>
5. Triangle: <4, 3, 5>
6. Triangle: <4, 5, 9>
7. Triangle: <4, 7, 9>
8. Triangle: <7, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
