Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles formed by the given edges are as follows:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 9, 3>
<1, 7, 0>
<1, 8, 3>
<2, 0, 5>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 0, 2>
<5, 8, 1>
<5, 8, 6>
<6, 3, 8>
<7, 0, 1>
<8, 1, 7>
<8, 3, 9>
<8, 5, 0>
<8, 5, 2>
<8, 6, 3>
<8, 9, 0>
<9, 0, 3>
<9, 3, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 22 triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [22].
