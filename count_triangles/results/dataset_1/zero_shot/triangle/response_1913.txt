Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are <0, 3, 8>, <0, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, and <4, 7, 9>. There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
