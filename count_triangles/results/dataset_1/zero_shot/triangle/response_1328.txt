Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles: 

<0, 3, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 8, 4>
<3, 2, 0>
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 8, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
