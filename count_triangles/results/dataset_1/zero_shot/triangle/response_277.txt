Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible loops of length 3. Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 2, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 8, 4>
<2, 6, 0>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 8, 1>
<2, 8, 4>
<2, 8, 6>
<2, 9, 3>
<3, 1, 4>
<3, 1, 8>
<3, 2, 6>
<3, 2, 9>
<3, 5, 4>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 1, 8>
<4, 1, 8>
<4, 8, 1>
<4, 8, 6>
<4, 9, 3>
<4, 9, 5>
<5, 3, 9>
<6, 0, 2>
<6, 2, 8>
<6, 8, 2>
<7, 9, 4>
<8, 1, 4>
<8, 1, 6>
<9, 2, 3>
<9, 2, 7>
<9, 3, 5>

Counting these unique triangles, we get a total of [30] triangles in the graph.
