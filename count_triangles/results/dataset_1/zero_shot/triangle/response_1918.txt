Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be found by summing up the number of triangles each node is involved in. To count the triangles efficiently, we will use the given edges.

The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>

Hence, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
