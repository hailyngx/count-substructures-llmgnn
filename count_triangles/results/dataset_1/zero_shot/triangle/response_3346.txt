Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Here are the triangles present in the given graph:

<0, 1, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 5>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 1, 9>
<8, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
