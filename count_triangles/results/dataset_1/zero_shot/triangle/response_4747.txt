Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 4>, <1, 5, 8>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the graph.
