Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, and <4, 6, 8>.
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
