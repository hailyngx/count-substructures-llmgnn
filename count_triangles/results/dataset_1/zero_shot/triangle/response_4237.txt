Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
