Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
