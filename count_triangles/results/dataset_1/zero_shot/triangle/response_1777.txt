Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
