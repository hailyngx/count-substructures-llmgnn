Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 4>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
