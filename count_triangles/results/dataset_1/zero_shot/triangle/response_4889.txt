Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] unique triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are:
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 2>
<3, 7, 8>
<5, 0, 2>
<5, 2, 3>
<5, 2, 7>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 4, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9> 

Therefore, the number of triangles is [10].
