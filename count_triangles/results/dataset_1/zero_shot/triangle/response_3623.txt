Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [4].

The unique triangles are: <0, 2, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, and <3, 4, 6>.
