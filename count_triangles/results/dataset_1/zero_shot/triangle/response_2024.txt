Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by looking for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 8>

Count of triangles: [7]
