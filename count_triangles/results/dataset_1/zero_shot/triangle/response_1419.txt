Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the unique paths of length 2 between nodes. Let's find the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <2, 6, 5>
2. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 7, 4>
4. Triangle <3, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 2>
6. Triangle <3, 8, 6>
7. Triangle <4, 7, 2>
8. Triangle <4, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
