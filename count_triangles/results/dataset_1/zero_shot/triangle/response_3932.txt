Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
[<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 4>, <3, 2, 4>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 2, 6>, <4, 2, 7>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 2>]
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [15].
