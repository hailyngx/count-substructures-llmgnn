Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
