Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>

So, there are 9 triangles in total in the given graph. 
The answer is [9].
