Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 4.

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 4, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
