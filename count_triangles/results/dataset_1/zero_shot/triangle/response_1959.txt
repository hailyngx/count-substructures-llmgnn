Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 9, 4>
<3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
