Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in this graph. 

The triangles are:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<7, 3, 9>

Therefore, the answer is [4].
