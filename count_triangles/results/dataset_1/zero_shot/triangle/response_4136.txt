Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
     0 -- 6
    /|\    
   / | \   
  /  |  \  
 8 - 1   9
  \  |  / 
   \ | /  
    \|/   
     2 -- 5
      |
      |
      3 -- 4
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all possible cycles of length 3. 
After going through the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 2>, <1, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 4>

So the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
