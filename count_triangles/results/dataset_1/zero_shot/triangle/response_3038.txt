Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles are: <2, 0, 1>, <2, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 6>.
