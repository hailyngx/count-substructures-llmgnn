Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 1, 6>
<6, 4, 7>
<6, 8, 5>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [8].
