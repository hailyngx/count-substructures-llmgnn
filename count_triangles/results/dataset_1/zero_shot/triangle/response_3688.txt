Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <7, 9, 9>.
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
