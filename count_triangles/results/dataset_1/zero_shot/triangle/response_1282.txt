Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [10].
