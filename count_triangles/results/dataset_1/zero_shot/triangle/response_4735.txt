Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The unique triangles found in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [7].
