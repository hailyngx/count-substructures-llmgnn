Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 6, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 8. [8]
