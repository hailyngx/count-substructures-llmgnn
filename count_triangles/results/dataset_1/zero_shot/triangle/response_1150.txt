Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by identifying all the unique triangles formed by the edges. Let's list them below:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 3, 7>
4. <0, 7, 8>
5. <2, 8, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
