Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <6, 7, 9>. 
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [7].
