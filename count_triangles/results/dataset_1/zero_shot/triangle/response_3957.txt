Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<2, 5, 1>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 6>
<5, 7, 6>

So, the final answer is [4].
