Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <3, 4, 5>
3. <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
