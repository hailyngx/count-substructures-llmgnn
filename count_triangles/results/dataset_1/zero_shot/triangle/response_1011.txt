Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

[<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 1>, <4, 8, 5>, <5, 6, 3>, <5, 6, 8>, <8, 5, 9>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
