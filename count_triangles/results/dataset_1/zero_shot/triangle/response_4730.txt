Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
