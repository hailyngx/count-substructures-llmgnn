Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are connected to each other. In this case, we can see that the triangles in this graph are:

<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, <7, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 8. 

So, the final answer is: [8]
