Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 9, 8>
<5, 6, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
