Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the graph.
