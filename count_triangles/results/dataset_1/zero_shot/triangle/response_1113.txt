Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<6, 7, 8>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
