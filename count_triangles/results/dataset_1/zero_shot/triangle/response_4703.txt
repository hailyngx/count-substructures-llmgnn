Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [7] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <4, 3, 5>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 0, 4>, <4, 5, 3>, <8, 9, 1>.
