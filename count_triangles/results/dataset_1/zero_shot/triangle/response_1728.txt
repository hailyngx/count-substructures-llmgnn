Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are total of [20] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>.
