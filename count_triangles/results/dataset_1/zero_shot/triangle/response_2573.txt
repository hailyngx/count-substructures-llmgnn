Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 3>.
