Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of and then dividing by 3 since each triangle is counted 3 times (once for each node). 

After examining the given graph, the triangles in this graph are <0, 1, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, and <3, 8, 9>.

These five triangles each contribute 3 triangles to the total count, so the final answer is [15].
