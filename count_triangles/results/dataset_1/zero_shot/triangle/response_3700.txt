Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
[<3, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>]

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
