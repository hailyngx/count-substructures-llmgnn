Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 1, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 0, 3>, <5, 1, 8>, <6, 1, 9>, <7, 0, 3>, <7, 8, 0>, <8, 1, 5>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
