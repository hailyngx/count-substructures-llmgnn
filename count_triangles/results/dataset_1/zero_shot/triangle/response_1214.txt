Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 1>, <2, 4, 9>.
