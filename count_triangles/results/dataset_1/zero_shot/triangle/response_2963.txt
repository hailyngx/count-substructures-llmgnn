Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by finding the number of closed loops of length 3. This can be done by examining every possible combination of three nodes in the graph and checking if they form a triangle.

In this case, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles found in this graph are <0, 2, 4>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, and <3, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
