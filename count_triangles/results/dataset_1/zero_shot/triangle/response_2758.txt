Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph described has the following triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 9, 5>, <2, 0, 9>, <3, 0, 5>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 9, 5>.

There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
