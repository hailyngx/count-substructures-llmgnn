Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <1, 6, 9>
3. <1, 7, 5>
4. <1, 8, 4>
5. <3, 4, 8>
6. <3, 9, 6>
7. <4, 8, 9>
8. <9, 2, 3>
9. <9, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
