Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 8> 

Total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
