Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

The triangles formed by the nodes are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 0, 9>

There are 8 unique triangles in this graph, so the final count is: [8].
