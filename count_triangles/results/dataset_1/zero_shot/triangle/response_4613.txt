Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 2>
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 9, 3>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 9, 3>
<5, 8, 0>
<7, 3, 9>
<8, 5, 9>
<9, 2, 6>

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in total. 
The final answer is: [14]
