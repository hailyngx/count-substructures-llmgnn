Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
