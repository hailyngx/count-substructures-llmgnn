Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<1, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<4, 1, 8>
<5, 9, 8>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
