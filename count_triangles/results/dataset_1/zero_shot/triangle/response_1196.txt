Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph consists of the following edges:
- (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)
- (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)
- (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 7)
- (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 8)
- (4, 0), (4, 7)
- (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7)
- (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 9)
- (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5)
- (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 9)
- (9, 6), (9, 8)

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <1, 2, 7>
4. <1, 6, 8>
5. <3, 5, 7>
6. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [6].
