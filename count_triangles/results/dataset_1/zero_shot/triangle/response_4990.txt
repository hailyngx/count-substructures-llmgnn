Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 8, 2>, <5, 7, 2>, <5, 9, 6>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the graph.
