Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: <1, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
