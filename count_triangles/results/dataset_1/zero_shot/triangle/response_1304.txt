Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in total.
