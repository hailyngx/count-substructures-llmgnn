Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] unique triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 1, 2>
<7, 1, 2> 

Thus, the answer is [12].
