Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, and <4, 5, 8>.  

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
