Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
