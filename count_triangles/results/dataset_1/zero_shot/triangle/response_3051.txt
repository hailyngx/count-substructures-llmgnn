Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
