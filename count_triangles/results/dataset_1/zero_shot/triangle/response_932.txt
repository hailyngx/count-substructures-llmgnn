Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
