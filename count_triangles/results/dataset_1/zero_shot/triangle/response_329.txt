Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 6>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 2, 4>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 8, 6>, <3, 8, 4>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 0>, <4, 9, 0>, <6, 7, 8>. 
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
