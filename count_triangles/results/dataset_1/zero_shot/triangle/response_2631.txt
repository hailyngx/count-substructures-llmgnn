Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be computed by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the connected nodes. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

[<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 2>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 2>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
