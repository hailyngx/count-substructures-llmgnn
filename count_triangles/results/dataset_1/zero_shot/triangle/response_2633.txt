Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets:

[<0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 0>, <4, 3, 6>, <5, 7, 1>, <5, 7, 8>]
