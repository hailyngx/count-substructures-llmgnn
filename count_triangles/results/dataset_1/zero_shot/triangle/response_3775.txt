Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
