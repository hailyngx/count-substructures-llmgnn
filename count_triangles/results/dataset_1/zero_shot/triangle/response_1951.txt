Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the given edges. 

The triangles are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
