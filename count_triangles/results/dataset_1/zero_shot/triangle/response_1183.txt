Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 5>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 1, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
