Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    7---0
    |  /
    | / 
    5---1     2
     \  |     |
      \ |     |
        8--3--6
           | /
           |/
           4
           |
           9
```

The total number of triangles in this graph is 4. The unique triangles are <0, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, and <5, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
