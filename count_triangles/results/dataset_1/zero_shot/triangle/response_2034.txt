Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 -- 1 -- 3 -- 9
|         |    
8         |
|         |
6 -- 4 -- 
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the triangles present. Here are the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 3, 6>
4. [3]  (A triangle formed by node 3 alone)

Hence, there are 4 triangles in the given graph, so the answer is [4].
