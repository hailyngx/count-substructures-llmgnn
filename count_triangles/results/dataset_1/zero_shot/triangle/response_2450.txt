Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    4 --- 7
   /|     |\
  / |     | \
 5--0-----8--9
 | / \   /|
 |/   \ / |
 1 --- 2--6
   \   /
    \ /
     3
```

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can look for unique cycles of length 3 using the given edges. The list of unique triangles found in this graph is as follows: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, and <4, 5, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
