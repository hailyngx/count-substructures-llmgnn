Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
