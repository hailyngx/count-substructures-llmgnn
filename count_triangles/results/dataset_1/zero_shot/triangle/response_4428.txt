Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as:

```
0 -- 6 -- 8
|    |    |
7    9    |
|    |    |
1 -- 3 -- 5
|         |
4         |
|         |
`-- 7 -- 9
```

Now, let's find the triangles in this graph:

1. <0, 6, 9>
2. <0, 7, 9>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <4, 7, 9>
5. <6, 8, 4>
6. <6, 9, 7>

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in total in this graph. So, the final answer is [6].
