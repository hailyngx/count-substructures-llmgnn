Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 4>
<3, 5, 4>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 4>
<3, 7, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
