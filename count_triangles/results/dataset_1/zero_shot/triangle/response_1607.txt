Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 3, 8>, <8, 1, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
