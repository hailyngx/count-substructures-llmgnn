Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph consists of the following triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>.  
Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
