Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The given graph has 4 triangles. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 5, 9>
<0, 2, 5>
<6, 7, 8>
<0, 5, 2>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
