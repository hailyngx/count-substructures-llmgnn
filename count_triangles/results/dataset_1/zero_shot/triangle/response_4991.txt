Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be formed by finding cycles of length 3. Let's identify the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle: <0, 4, 7>
2. Triangle: <0, 4, 9>
3. Triangle: <0, 7, 1>
4. Triangle: <2, 8, 5>
5. Triangle: <2, 8, 9>
6. Triangle: <3, 4, 9>
7. Triangle: <3, 7, 1>
8. Triangle: <4, 9, 3>
9. Triangle: <7, 0, 4>
10. Triangle: <8, 2, 9>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.   
So, the answer is [10].
