Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of triangles found:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
