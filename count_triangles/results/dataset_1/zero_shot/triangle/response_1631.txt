Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles formed by choosing 3 nodes from the graph. Since the graph is undirected, we do not consider the direction of edges.

Upon analyzing the given graph, we can find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 6, 5>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <2, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
