Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<8, 4, 6>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 6, 7>
<8, 6, 9>
<8, 7, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [9].
