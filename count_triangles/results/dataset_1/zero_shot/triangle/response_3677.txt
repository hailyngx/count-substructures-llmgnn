Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 0, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
