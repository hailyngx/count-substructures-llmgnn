Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 6, 2>
<4, 6, 3>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
