Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <7, 8, 9>

There are total of [8] triangles in the graph.
