Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
