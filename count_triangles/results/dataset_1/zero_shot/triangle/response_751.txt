Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
