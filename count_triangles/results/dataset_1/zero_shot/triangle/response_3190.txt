Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
