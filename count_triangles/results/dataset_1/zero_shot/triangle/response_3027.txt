Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:
[<0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 9, 0>, <4, 7, 3>, <6, 0, 8>, <8, 5, 6>]  
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
