Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 4.  

The unique triangles are:
<2, 1, 8>
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 7, 5>
<4, 3, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
