Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by checking all possible combinations of three nodes that are interconnected.

After reviewing the provided edges, the following triangles are found: <0, 1, 5>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <5, 8, 6>, <5, 9, 6>, <9, 7, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
