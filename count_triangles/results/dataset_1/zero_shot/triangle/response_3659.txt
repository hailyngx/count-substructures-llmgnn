Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, and <4, 6, 9> triangles in this graph. Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
