Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the provided graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 5>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 9, 3>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
