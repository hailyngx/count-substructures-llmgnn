Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 3, 4>  
<1, 6, 9>  
<3, 4, 9>  
<6, 7, 9>  

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in total.
