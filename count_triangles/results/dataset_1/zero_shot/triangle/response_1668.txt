Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8)
