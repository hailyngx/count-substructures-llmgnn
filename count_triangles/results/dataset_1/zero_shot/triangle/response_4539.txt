Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here, I have listed all the triangles found in the graph:

- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
