Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
   0 -- 5 -- 2 -- 7
   |    |         |
   8 -- 1 -- 3    8
        |    |
        9    7
```

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can look for closed loops of size 3. 

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 4>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 5, 7>, <5, 4, 6>

Count of triangles: [9]
