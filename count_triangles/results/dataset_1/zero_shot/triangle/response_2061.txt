Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 8, 2>, <3, 8, 4>, <4, 8, 7>, <4, 8, 2>, <4, 8, 1>, <7, 8, 2>
There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
