Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
So, the answer is [4].
The unique triangles found are <3, 4, 5>, <5, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, and <6, 7, 9>.
