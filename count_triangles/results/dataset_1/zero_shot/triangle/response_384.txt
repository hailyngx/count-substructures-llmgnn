Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 9, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
