Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 7>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
