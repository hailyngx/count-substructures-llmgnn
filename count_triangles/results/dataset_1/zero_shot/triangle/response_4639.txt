Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 2>, <6, 7, 8>. 

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in total.
