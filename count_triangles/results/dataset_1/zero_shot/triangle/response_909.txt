Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 8, 1>
- <1, 7, 4>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 8, 5>
- <2, 8, 0>
- <3, 0, 4>
- <4, 7, 6>
- <5, 4, 7>
- <6, 2, 5>
- <7, 4, 1>
- <8, 0, 1>

There are 14 unique triangles in total.   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
