Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <7, 4, 9>, <7, 2, 9>, <9, 8, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
