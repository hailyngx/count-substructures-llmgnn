Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 2>, <2, 9, 5>, and <6, 5, 9>.  
So, the final answer is [5].
