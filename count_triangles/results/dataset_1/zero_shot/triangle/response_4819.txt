Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 8>

There are [4] triangles in total.
