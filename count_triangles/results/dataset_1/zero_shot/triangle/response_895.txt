Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles found in the given graph are:

<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 7>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
