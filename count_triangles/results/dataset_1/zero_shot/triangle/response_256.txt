Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 2. 

The unique triangles are <0, 1, 8> and <2, 3, 5>.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
