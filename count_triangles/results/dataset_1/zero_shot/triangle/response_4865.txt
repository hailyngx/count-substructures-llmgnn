Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 2>
  
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
