Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be identified by finding sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:

<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
