Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles found: <2, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 5>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 8, 9>, <9, 5, 7>, <9, 8, 4>, <0, 9, 4>, <0, 4, 2>, <6, 5, 2>.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
