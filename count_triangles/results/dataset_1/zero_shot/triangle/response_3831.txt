Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are: <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <9, 3, 4> and <9, 4, 5>.  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
