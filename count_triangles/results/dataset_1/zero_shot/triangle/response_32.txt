Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The list of unique triangles found in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
