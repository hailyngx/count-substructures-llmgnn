Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 5, 1>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 3, 7>, <6, 0, 7>, <7, 1, 8>

There are a total of 8 triangles in this graph. Hence, the answer is [8].
