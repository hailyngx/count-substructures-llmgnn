Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be counted by identifying all possible sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By examining the given edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <1, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 4>

Thus, there are [2] triangles in the given graph: <1, 2, 6> and <2, 3, 4>.
