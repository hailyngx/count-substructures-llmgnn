Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 11 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
[<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 9>] 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
