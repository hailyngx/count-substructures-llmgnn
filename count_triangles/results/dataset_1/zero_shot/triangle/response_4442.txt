Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the answer is [6].
