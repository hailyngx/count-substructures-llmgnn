Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of closed loops of length 3. Let's find the triangles:

1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 7, 4>
3. <0, 7, 5>
4. <0, 7, 8>
5. <2, 8, 4>
6. <2, 8, 6>
7. <2, 9, 0>
8. <2, 9, 3>
9. <3, 7, 5>
10. <3, 7, 8>
11. <4, 7, 5>
12. <4, 7, 8>
13. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [13].
