Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph: <0, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 0>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <7, 9, 5>.
