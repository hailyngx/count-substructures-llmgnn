Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph:

[<0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 5, 6>]

[7 triangles]
