Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the provided graph are:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 9, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
