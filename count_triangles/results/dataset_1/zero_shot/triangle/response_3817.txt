Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
[<2, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <6, 7, 9>, <2, 6, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>]

The answer is [12].
