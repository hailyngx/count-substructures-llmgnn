Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets:

[<2, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 2>, <4, 9, 8>]
