Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all the unique combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

[<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 3>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 8, 4>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 5, 3>, <3, 7, 5>, <3, 8, 4>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 5>, <6, 7, 5>, <7, 5, 6>, <8, 4, 9>, <8, 9, 3>]

There are 19 unique triangles found in the given graph, and the final answer is [19].
