Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
    1 --- 6 --- 8
   /       |     |
  0 -- 2   4 -- 3
   \       |   / |
    5-7    |  /
          /
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will list all possible triangles.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <4, 6, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in this graph is [9].
