Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the given graph are: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
