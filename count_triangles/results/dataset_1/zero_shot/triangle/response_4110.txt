Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of unique triangles in the given graph is [7].

The unique triangles are: <0, 2, 4>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
