Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of closed loops of length 3. In this case, we can directly count the number of triangles in the graph.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 6, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 5>
<5, 6, 9>
The final answer is therefore [9].
