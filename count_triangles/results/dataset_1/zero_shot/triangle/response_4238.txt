Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
