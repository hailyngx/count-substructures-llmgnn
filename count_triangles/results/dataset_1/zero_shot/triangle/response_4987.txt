Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:  
<2, 4, 8>  
<2, 4, 9>  
<2, 3, 4>  
<4, 7, 8>  

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
