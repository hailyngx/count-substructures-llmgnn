Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.

We need to count the number of triangles in this graph.

Looking at the connections, the triangles in this graph are:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <2, 4, 5>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2, and the answer is [2].
