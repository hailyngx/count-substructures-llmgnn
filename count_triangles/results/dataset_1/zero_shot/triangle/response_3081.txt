Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
