Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<3, 1, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <6, 4, 5>, <3, 0, 1>, <3, 8, 7>, <6, 8, 7>, <2, 7, 9>] 

Therefore, the final answer is: [9]
