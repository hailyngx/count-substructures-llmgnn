Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 8, 5>
<1, 7, 6>
<1, 9, 5>
<5, 9, 6>

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the graph.
