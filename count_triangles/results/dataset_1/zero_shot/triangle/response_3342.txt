Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
[<0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 7, 6>, <1, 7, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 6>]

There are 9 triangles in total. 
Therefore, the answer is [9].
