Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be counted by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are connected by edges. Let's list out the triangles and count the total number.

Triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 8, 3>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 6, 3>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 4>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 0>
<3, 8, 6>
<4, 5, 1>
<4, 5, 3>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 1, 6>
<5, 2, 1>
<5, 2, 3>
<5, 3, 4>
<6, 1, 5>
<6, 3, 8>
<6, 9, 3>
<6, 9, 8>
<7, 0, 4>
<7, 4, 8>
<8, 0, 3>
<8, 3, 6>
<8, 3, 9>
<8, 7, 4>
<8, 9, 6>
<9, 3, 6>
<9, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [32] as listed above.
