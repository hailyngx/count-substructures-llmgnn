Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 9>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
