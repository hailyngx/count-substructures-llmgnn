Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph. Here they are: 

[<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 4>, <4, 5, 8>, <8, 5, 9>, <8, 2, 5>, <8, 2, 4>, <8, 2, 9>, <9, 3, 7>, <9, 8, 7>, <9, 3, 8>]
