Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 7, 3>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <7, 3, 9>, <7, 9, 6>, <7, 9, 8>, <8, 9, 6>, <8, 9, 7>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [17].
