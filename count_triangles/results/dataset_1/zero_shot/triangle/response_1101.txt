Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 8, 0>
<4, 9, 0>
<4, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
