Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<5, 8, 9>
<1, 8, 4>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 4>
<5, 9, 7>
<8, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [18].
