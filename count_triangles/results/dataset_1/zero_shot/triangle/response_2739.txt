Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by counting the number of triangles in the graph. A triangle in a graph is a set of three nodes where each pair of nodes is connected by an edge.

By examining the given graph, we can observe the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 6 unique triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [6].
