Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [16] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 1>
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 0, 5>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<4, 0, 5>
<4, 0, 8>
<4, 8, 6>
<5, 0, 1>
<8, 4, 0>
<8, 4, 6>

Therefore, the answer is [16].
