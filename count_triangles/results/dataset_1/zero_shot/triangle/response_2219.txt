Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<0, 4, 7>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 4, 1>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 1, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<4, 5, 1>
<4, 5, 3>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 0>
<4, 7, 2>
<6, 4, 7>
<6, 4, 0>
<6, 4, 1>
<6, 9, 0>

There are a total of 16 unique triangles in the graph, so the final answer is [16].
