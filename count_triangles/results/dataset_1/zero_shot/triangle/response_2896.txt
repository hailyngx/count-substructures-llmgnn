Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 -- 3 -- 5
    |    |    |
    7 -- 1 -- 4
    |    |    |
    2 -- 6    8 -- 9
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Here is the list of triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <1, 3, 4>
4. <3, 4, 6>
5. <3, 4, 5>
6. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [6].
