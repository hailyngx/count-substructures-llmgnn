Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:
[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <8, 6, 3>, <8, 6, 2>] 
Therefore, the answer is [6].
