Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the graph.  
The final answer is [6].
