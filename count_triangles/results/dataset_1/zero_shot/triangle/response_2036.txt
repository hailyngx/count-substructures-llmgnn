Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 6 unique triangles, which are:

1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <2, 3, 9>
4. <2, 4, 8>
5. <3, 5, 6>
6. <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
