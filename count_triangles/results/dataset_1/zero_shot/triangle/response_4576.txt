Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <5, 6, 9>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
