Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles present in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 4, 2>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 9, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 3>, <3, 5, 8>, <6, 9, 1>, <8, 1, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the graph. 
The final answer is [9].
