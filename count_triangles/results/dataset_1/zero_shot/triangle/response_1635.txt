Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. 

For each node pair (x, y), if there exists a node z such that there are edges (x, z), (y, z), and (x, y), then we have identified a triangle.

Let's go through each possible triangle in the given graph:

1. Triangle: <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
3. Triangle: <0, 1, 8>
4. Triangle: <0, 2, 6>
5. Triangle: <0, 6, 7>
6. Triangle: <0, 6, 8>
7. Triangle: <1, 3, 6>
8. Triangle: <1, 4, 6>
9. Triangle: <1, 5, 6>
10. Triangle: <6, 2, 3>
11. Triangle: <6, 2, 4>
12. Triangle: <6, 2, 5>
13. Triangle: <0, 1, 6>
14. Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
15. Triangle: <0, 1, 5>
16. Triangle: <6, 3, 4>
17. Triangle: <6, 3, 5>
18. Triangle: <6, 4, 5>

Counting all these unique triangles, we get a total of 18 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
