Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected with each other. I will go ahead and list the triangles found in the graph:

<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<6, 4, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Hence, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
