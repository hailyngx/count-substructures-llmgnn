Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are: 

<0, 1, 5>  
<0, 5, 6>  
<0, 5, 9>  
<0, 7, 8>  
<0, 8, 9>  
<2, 3, 4>  
<2, 4, 6>  
<5, 4, 6>  

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total. The final answer is [8].
