Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 1 -- 2
|         |
9 -- 3     5
|         |
6 -- 4 -- 8
    |
    7
```

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's list them down:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <1, 2, 5>
3. <1, 3, 9>
4. <1, 5, 6>
5. <2, 5, 6>
6. <4, 6, 8>
7. <5, 6, 9>

Counting the number of unique triangles, we have found 7 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
