Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
