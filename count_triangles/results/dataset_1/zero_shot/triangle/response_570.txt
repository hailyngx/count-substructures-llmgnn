Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <2, 7, 8>, <2, 8, 3>, <2, 9, 2>, <2, 8, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <3, 4, 8>.  
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
