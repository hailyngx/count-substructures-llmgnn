Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
