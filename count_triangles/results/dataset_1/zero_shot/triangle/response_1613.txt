Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the graph.
