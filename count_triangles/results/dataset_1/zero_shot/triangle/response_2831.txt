Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [5].  
The unique triangles found are <3, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 9, 2>.
