Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
