Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 8>.
These are the only triangles present in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
