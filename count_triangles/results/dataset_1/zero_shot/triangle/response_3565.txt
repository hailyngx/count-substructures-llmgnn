Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
