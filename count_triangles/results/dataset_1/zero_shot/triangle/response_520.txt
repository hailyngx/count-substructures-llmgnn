Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:  

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(d_i)(d_i - 1)(d_i - 2) \]

Where \( n \) is the number of nodes, and \( d_i \) is the degree of node \( i \).

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can calculate the number of triangles.

Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 6
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3

Plugging the degree values into the formula:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6}[(4)(3)(2) + (4)(3)(2) + (3)(2)(1) + (3)(2)(1) + (6)(5)(4) + (2)(1)(0) + (1)(0)(-1) + (3)(2)(1) + (3)(2)(1)] \]

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6}[24 + 24 + 6 + 6 + 120 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 6] \]

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6}[192] \]

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = 32 \]

There are 32 triangles in the given graph. Listing the unique triangles:

\[ [ <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 4>, <4, 8, 9> ] \]
