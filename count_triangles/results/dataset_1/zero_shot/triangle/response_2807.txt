Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles present in the given graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 8, 1>
- Triangle 2: <8, 3, 0>
- Triangle 3: <9, 2, 4>
- Triangle 4: <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle 5: <1, 8, 6>
- Triangle 6: <6, 9, 1>
- Triangle 7: <0, 8, 3>

There are a total of 7 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the answer is [7].
