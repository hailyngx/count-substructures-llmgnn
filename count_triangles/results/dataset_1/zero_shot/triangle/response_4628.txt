Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 4, 9>, <8, 9, 1>.
Therefore, the final answer is [14].
