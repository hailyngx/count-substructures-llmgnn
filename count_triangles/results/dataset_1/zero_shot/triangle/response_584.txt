Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<[0, 3, 6]>, <[0, 4, 5]>, <[5, 8, 9]>

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the graph. Thus, the answer is [3].
