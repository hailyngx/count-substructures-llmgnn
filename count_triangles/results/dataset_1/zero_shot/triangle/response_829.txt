Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph has 4 triangles. 

List of triangles:
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
<1, 9, 0>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
