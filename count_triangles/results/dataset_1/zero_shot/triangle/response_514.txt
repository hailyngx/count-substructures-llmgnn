Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three nodes connected by edges. Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:

<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8>

Thus, there are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
