Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 1, 5>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
