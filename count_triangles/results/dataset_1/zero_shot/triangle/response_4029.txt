Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The list of unique triangles is as follows: 

<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 1, 9>
<8, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
