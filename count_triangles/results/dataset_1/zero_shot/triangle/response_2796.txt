Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be identified as follows:

<1, 3, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the graph.
