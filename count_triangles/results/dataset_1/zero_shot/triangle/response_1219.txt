Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<0, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 4>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 1>
<4, 5, 2>
<4, 5, 3>
<8, 9, 6>

There are 10 triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
