Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1--8
   / \
  6---7
 / \ /|\
0---4 3-5
 \ /
  2
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Through inspection, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 6, 7>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <2, 5, 6>
5. <3, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in total. So, the final answer is [5].
