Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 7, 1> 

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
