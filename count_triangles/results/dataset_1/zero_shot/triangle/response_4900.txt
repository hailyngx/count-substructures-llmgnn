Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by looking for three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the unique triangles found in the given graph:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 4, 9>

Since there are 8 unique triangles in the graph, the final answer is [8].
