Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are formed by cycles of length 3. Let's count the number of triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangles formed by node 0: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 9>
2. Triangle formed by node 8: <1, 8, 5>
3. Triangle formed by node 9: <7, 9, 8>
 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 3. 

The answer is [3].
