Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 1 -- 5 -- 9
|         |    |
8         2 -- 4
          |    |
          3    6
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for cycles of length 3. Let's list the triangles and then count them:

<0, 1, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [4].
