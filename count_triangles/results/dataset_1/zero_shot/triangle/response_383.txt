Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, the number of triangles can be calculated by analyzing the nodes and edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected in a closed loop. 

Upon analyzing the graph and identifying all possible triangles, we find that there are 5 triangles in total. The unique triangles are:
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
