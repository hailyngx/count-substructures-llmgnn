Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <1, 2, 5>, <1, 8, 7>, <1, 8, 4>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 1, 8>, <2, 1, 5>, <4, 3, 6>, <4, 3, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 6, 8>, <7, 6, 4>, <7, 8, 1>, <7, 8, 4>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 1, 2>, <8, 1, 5>, <8, 1, 9>, <8, 4, 3>, <8, 4, 6>, <8, 4, 7>, <8, 4, 9>, <8, 7, 6>, <8, 7, 4>, <8, 7, 9>, <8, 9, 1>, <8, 9, 4>, <8, 9, 7>, <9, 0, 8>, <9, 8, 1>, <9, 8, 4>, <9, 8, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [35] triangles in the given graph.
