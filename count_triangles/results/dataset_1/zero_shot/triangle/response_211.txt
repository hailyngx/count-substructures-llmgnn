Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be formed by finding the nodes that create closed loops among three nodes. 

Upon examination, the triangles in this graph are as follows:
<1, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the graph.
