Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].  
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 3, 9>, <3, 7, 5>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 4>.
