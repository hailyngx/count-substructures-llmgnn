Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
