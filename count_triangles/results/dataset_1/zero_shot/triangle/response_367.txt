Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes and the edges provided. 

After analyzing the graph, the triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <0, 8, 4>, <8, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
