Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by looking at every combination of three nodes that form a triangle. 

Upon examining the graph provided, we find the following triangles:
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 9, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 8>
<8, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
