Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 1>
<0, 9, 3>
<0, 9, 5>
<0, 9, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
