Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<5, 6, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
