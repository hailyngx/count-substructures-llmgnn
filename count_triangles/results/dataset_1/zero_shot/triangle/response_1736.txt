Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be found by identifying nodes that form closed loops of length 3. Here are the unique triangles in this graph:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 9>

There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [4].
