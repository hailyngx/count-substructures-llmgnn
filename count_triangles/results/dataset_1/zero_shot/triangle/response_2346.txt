Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles formed by unique sets of three nodes. 

After examining the given graph, we can find the following triangles:

<0, 1, 2>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<1, 2, 7>  
<1, 3, 8>  
<1, 8, 9>  
<2, 6, 7>  
<2, 7, 9>  
<3, 8, 9>  
<4, 5, 9>  
<4, 8, 9>  
<5, 9, 0>  
<8, 9, 1>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
