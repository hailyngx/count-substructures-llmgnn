Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<3, 4, 6>
<3, 8, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 9, 3>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
