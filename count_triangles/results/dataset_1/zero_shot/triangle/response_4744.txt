Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 20 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 8, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 3>, <1, 6, 2>, <4, 9, 7>, <1, 0, 3>, <1, 9, 6>, <2, 1, 8>, <6, 9, 8>, <1, 9, 4>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
