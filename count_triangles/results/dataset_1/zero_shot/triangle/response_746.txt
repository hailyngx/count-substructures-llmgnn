Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 9>.  
The total number of triangles is [4].
