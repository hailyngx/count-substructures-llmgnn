Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the graph. The unique triangles are as follows: 

<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 0, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 3, 5>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 3, 6>
<6, 0, 9>
<6, 2, 9>
<6, 7, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15]
