Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 1, 5>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
