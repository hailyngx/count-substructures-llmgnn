Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
