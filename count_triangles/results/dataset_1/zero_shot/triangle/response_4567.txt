Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<2, 9, 3>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <1, 7, 2>, <5, 9, 4>, <2, 0, 3>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 9>]  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
