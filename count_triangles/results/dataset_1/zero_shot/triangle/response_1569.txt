Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 2, 6>
4. <2, 4, 6>
5. <2, 6, 9>
6. <3, 5, 9>
7. <3, 8, 9>
8. <3, 5, 9>
9. <6, 7, 8>
10. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10].
