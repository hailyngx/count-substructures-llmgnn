Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the given graph are: 

<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <6, 7, 3>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [8].
