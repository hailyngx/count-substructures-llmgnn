Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has a total of 6 triangles. Here they are listed within brackets:

[<0, 7, 8>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 8, 5>, <2, 7, 3>, <7, 9, 3>]
