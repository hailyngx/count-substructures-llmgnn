Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
- <1, 5, 8>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <8, 6, 2>
- <8, 9, 3>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
