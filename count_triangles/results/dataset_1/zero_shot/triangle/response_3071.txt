Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in this graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the answer is [5].
