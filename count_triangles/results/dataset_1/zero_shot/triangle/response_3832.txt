Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in total. 
The final answer is [6].
