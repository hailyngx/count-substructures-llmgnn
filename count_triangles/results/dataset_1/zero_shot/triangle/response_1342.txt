Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 5. The unique triangles are <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
