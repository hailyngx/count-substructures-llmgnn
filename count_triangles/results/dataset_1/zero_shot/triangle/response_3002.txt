Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: 

<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 7, 3>
<4, 3, 8>
<4, 8, 1>
<4, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<8, 1, 6>
<8, 1, 9>
<9, 2, 6>

There are a total of 12 triangles in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [12].
