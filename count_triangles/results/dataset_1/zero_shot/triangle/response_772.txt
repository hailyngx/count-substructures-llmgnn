Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:  
<0, 1, 2>  
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<1, 3, 5>  
<1, 5, 9>  
<2, 0, 1>  
<5, 7, 4>  
<5, 7, 0>  
<5, 7, 4>
