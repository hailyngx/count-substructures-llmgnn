Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles found:
[<0, 6, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 6, 3>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 1, 6>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 4, 8>, <5, 4, 1>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 4, 3>, <5, 6, 3>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 9, 7>] 
Therefore, the final answer is [16].
