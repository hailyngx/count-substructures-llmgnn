Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three nodes that are connected by edges. 

By inspecting the given graph, we can list the unique triangles as follows:

<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 5>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
