Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 4, and they are: <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 9>.  

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
