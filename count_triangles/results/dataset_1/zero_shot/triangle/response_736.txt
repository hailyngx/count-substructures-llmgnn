Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify sets of 3 nodes that are all interconnected. Let's find all the triangles.

After analyzing the given edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 unique triangles in this graph.

The final answer is: [10]
