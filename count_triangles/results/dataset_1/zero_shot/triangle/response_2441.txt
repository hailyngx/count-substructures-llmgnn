Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following unique triangles:
<1, 8, 2>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 9, 4>
<3, 8, 7>
<5, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
