Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 4, 2>
<6, 3, 9>
<8, 6, 7>

There are [3] triangles in total.
