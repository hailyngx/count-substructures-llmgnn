Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of connected triples of nodes. In this case, the graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges.

Let's list the triangles present in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
4. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
6. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
8. Triangle <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
