Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.  
So, the final answer is [2].
