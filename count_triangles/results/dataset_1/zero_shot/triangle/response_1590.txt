Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<0, 3, 1>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 8, 1>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
