Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets []:

[<1, 2, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 8>]
