Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
