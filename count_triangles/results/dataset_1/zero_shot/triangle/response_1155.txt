Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
