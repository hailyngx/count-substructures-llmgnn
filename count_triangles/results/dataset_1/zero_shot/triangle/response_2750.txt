Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in total in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
[<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 0, 4>, <2, 0, 3>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 5, 0>, <3, 6, 0>, <6, 0, 9>, <7, 9, 6>] 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
