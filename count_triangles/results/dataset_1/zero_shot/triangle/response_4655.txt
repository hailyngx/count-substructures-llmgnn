Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 2>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 7, 2>, <7, 5, 0>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [19].
