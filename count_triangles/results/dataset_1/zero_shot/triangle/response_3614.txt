Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph is calculated by summing up the number of triangles each node participates in.

For this graph, the triangles are as follows:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle 3: <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle 4: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 5: <2, 1, 5>
- Triangle 6: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 7: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 8: <2, 9, 3>
- Triangle 9: <3, 6, 8>
- Triangle 10: <3, 8, 5>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [10].
