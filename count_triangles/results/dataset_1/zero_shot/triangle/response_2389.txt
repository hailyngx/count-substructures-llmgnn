Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
