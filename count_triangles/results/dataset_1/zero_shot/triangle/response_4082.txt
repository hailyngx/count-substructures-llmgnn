Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [18].  
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 6>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>.
