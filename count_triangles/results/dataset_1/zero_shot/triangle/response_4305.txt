Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the graph.

The triangles are:
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 1>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
