Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles present in the given graph is as follows:

[<0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>]

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
