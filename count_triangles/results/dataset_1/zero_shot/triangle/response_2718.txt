Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 2>
<4, 5, 7>
<6, 0, 7>
<6, 0, 9>
<6, 8, 3>
<7, 3, 4>
<7, 3, 9>
<9, 7, 6>

There are a total of [10] triangles present in the given graph.
