Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 1, 4>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 9, 3>.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
