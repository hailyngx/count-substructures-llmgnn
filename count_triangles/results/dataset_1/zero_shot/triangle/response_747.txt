Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph.  
The triangles are:  
<0, 1, 8>  
<2, 6, 7>  
<2, 7, 4>  
<3, 4, 9>  

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
