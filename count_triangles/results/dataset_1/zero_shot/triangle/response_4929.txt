Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here is the breakdown of the triangles and the final answer:

1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <2, 3, 7>
5. <3, 5, 7>
6. <4, 5, 9>
7. <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [7].
