Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<[3, 4, 6]>
<[3, 5, 7]>
<[6, 7, 9]>

There are a total of 3 triangles in the graph. Hence, the total number of triangles is [3].
