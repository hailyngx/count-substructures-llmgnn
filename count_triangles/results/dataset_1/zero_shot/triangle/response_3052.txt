Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph.  

The triangles are:  
<2, 7, 5>  
<2, 7, 8>  
<6, 3, 2>  
<6, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
