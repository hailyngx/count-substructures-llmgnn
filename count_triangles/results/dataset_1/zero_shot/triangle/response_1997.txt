Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. To determine the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all possible triangles formed by the edges.

Let's list all the triangles found in this graph:
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 6. 
So, the answer is [6].
