Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 8>

There are 5 unique triangles in total. Hence, the final answer is [5].
