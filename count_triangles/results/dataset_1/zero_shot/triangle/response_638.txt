Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by examining all the possible combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges, i.e., triangles. 

Upon analyzing the provided edge information, the unique triangles in the graph are:
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 1>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 7>
<5, 0, 1>
<5, 6, 1>
<7, 3, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is 10.

Therefore, the final answer is: [10]
