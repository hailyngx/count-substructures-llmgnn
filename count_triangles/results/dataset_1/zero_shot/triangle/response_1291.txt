Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be determined by identifying sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
