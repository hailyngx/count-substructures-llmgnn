Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
