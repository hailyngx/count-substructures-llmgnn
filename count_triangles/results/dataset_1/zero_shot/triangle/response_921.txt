Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is involved in and then dividing by 3 (since each triangle involves 3 nodes).

By examining the edges in the graph, we can determine the following triangles:
1. Nodes 0, 1, 2 form a triangle.
2. Nodes 0, 3, 9 form a triangle.
3. Nodes 1, 2, 9 form a triangle.
4. Nodes 4, 8, 9 form a triangle.
5. Nodes 5, 6, 8 form a triangle.

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph.

The answer is: [5]
