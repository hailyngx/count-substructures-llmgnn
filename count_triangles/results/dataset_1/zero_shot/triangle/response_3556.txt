Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
[<0, 2, 7>, <2, 6, 7>] 

There are a total of 2 triangles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
