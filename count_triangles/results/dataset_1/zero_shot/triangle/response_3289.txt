Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented with the following adjacency list:

0: [1, 7, 8]
1: [0, 2, 5, 7]
2: [1, 6, 7]
3: [7]
4: [6, 8]
5: [1, 9]
6: [2, 4, 7]
7: [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9]
8: [0, 4, 7, 9]
9: [5, 7, 8]

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

Taking every combination of 3 nodes, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>  <0, 7, 8>  <1, 2, 7>  <4, 6, 8>  <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
