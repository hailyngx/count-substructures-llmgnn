Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of paths of length 2. In this case, we will count triangles in the graph provided.

Based on the given edges, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
