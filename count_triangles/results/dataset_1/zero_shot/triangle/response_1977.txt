Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by finding all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
4. Triangle <1, 3, 8>
5. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
6. Triangle <1, 6, 8>
7. Triangle <3, 7, 9>
8. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
9. Triangle <4, 8, 9>
10. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

There are 10 triangles in total. Therefore, the answer is [10].
