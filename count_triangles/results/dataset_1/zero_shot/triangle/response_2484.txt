Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
