Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are: <1, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 9, 8>.
