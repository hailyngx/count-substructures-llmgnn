Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 1>
<3, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 2, 8>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 9>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
