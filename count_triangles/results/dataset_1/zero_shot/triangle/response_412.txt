Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by looking for closed loops of length 3. Let's analyze the given graph to find the triangles:

1. For node 0: (0, 1, 6)
2. For node 1: (1, 6, 0), (1, 6, 3), (1, 4, 7)
3. For node 2: (2, 3, 7)
4. For node 3: (3, 2, 7)
5. For node 4: (4, 1, 7)
6. For node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 0, 5), (6, 1, 4), (6, 1, 3), (6, 3, 7), (6, 5, 0), (6, 5, 3), (6, 5, 7), (6, 7, 2)
7. For node 7: (7, 2, 3), (7, 2, 4), (7, 3, 6), (7, 4, 1), (7, 4, 7)

From the above findings, the unique triangles in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 3>, <2, 3, 7>, <6, 0, 5>, <6, 1, 3>, <6, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 2>, <7, 2, 3>, <7, 2, 4>, <7, 3, 6>, <7, 4, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
