Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 17 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 8, 2>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 9, 2>, <5, 2, 8>, <5, 7, 6>, <6, 4, 9>, <7, 1, 8>, <7, 6, 0>, <9, 4, 6>, <9, 6, 0>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 2>, <1, 7, 3>. Therefore, the final answer is [17].
