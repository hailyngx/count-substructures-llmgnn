Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 3>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 9>.

Therefore, the answer is [10].
