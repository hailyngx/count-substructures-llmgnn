Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<5, 3, 6>
<7, 4, 8>

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in total. [6]
