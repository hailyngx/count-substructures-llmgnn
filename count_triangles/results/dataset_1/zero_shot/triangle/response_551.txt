Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in this graph. Here they are:

[<0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 7, 4>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 9, 4>]
