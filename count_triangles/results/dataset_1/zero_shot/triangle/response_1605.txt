Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

[<1, 2, 8>, <4, 5, 8>]

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the graph.
