Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:
<0, 3, 4>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
