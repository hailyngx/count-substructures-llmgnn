Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by looking for cycles of length 3, or in other words, by finding sets of three nodes that are all directly connected to each other.

In this graph, the unique triangles are:
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 9, 2>
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 6, 3>

Counting the unique triangles, we have found 12 triangles in total. So, the final answer is: [12]
