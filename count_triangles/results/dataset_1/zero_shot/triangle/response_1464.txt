Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
