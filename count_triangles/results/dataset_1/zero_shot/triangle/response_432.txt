Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three nodes.

After examining the given graph based on the provided edges, we can list the unique triangles as follows: 
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
