Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 13 triangles. The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<8, 9, 3>
<8, 9, 2>
<8, 9, 1>
<8, 9, 0>
<8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
