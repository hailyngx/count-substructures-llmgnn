Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<7, 6, 1>
<7, 6, 5>
<8, 4, 0>
<8, 4, 5>
<8, 5, 1>
<9, 3, 0>
<9, 0, 4> 

Therefore, the answer is [16].
