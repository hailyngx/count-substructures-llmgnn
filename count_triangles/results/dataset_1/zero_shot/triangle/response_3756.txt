Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 3>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 5, 9>
<6, 4, 7>
<6, 0, 3>
<6, 0, 7>
<7, 0, 3>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 0, 2>
<7, 2, 4>
<7, 2, 3>

There are a total of 15 triangles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
