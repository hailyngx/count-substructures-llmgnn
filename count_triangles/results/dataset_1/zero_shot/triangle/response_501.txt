Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 5>, <6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
