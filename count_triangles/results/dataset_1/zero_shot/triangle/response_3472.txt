Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The unique triangles in this graph are: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 2>.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
