Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in total.  
So, the answer is [9].
