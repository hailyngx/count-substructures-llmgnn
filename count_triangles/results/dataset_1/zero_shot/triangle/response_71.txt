Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting all the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are connected by edges.

After examining the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
