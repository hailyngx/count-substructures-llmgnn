Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<1, 0, 7>
<3, 1, 7>
<3, 2, 6>
<3, 2, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<8, 2, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
