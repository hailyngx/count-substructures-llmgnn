Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 1>, <3, 2, 5>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
