Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
