Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<6, 8, 9>

There are a total of 8 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
