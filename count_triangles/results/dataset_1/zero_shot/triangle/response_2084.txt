Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [10].
