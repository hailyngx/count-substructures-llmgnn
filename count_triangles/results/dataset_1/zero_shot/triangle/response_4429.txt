Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 11 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 8, 4>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 0, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
