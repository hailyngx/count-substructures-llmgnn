Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by counting the number of triangles formed by each set of three nodes connected by edges. 

Analyzing the given graph, the triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
