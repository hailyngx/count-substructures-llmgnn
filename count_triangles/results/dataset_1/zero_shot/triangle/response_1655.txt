Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following unique triangles:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 3>
<2, 0, 7>
<5, 0, 8>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
