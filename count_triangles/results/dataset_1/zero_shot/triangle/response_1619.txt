Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<7, 8, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
