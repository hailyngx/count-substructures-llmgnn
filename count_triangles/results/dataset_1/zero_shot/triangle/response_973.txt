Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by examining each node and checking how many pairs of neighbors are connected. Since we have a total of 10 nodes and the graph is undirected, we will consider the triangles by picking 3 vertices from the graph.

After analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
