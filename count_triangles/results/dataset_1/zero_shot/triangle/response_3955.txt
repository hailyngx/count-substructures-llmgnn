Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<7, 2, 9>
<8, 1, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 9, 1>
<4, 7, 0>
<4, 7, 2>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 9, 6>
<7, 9, 2> 

Therefore, the answer is [<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <7, 2, 9>, <8, 1, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 9, 1>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 9, 6>, <7, 9, 2>]
