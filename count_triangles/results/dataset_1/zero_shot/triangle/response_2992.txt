Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is a set of three nodes where each node is connected with the other two.

By examining the edges provided, we can determine the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <4, 8, 0>
3. Triangle <4, 8, 6>
4. Triangle <5, 3, 7>
5. Triangle <8, 2, 6>
6. Triangle <8, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [6].
