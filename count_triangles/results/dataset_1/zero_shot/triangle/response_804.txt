Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <2, 3, 4>
3. <6, 7, 8>
4. <6, 7, 9>
5. <7, 8, 9>
6. <8, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
