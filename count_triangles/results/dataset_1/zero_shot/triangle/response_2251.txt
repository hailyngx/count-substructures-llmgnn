Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, and <4, 8, 9>.
