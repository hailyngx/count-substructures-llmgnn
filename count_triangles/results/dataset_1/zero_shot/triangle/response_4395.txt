Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be counted by looking for the number of 3-cycles.

Based on the given graph, the triangles are as follows:  
<0, 1, 5>  
<1, 2, 6>  
<1, 4, 7>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
