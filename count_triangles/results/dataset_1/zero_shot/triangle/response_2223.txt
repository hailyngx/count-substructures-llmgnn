Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
