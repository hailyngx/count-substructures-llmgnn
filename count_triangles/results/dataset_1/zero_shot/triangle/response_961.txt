Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 1, 7>, <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
