Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 2, 4>
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 9, 3>
<3, 4, 9>
<8, 9, 1>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
