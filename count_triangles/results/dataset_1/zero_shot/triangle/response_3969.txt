Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

The triangles in this graph are:
<3, 0, 4>, <3, 4, 1>, <2, 8, 9>

So, there are 3 triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
