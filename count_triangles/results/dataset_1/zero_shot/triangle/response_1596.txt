Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph:

[<0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 8, 4>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 3>]
