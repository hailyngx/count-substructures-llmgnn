Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 17 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <0, 7, 3>
- <0, 9, 8>
- <2, 1, 9>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <6, 4, 7>
- <2, 6, 4>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 7, 4>
- <3, 7, 4>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <5, 2, 6>
- <5, 8, 0>
- <8, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
