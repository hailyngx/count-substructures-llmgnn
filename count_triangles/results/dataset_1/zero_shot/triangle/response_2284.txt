Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph given has the following edges:

- Nodes 0 and 5 are connected.
- Nodes 1 and 8 are connected.
- Nodes 2 and 7 are connected.
- Nodes 3 and 9 are connected.
- Nodes 4 and 5 are connected.
- Nodes 4 and 7 are connected.
- Nodes 5 and 0 are connected.
- Nodes 5 and 4 are connected.
- Nodes 5 and 8 are connected.
- Nodes 5 and 9 are connected.
- Nodes 7 and 2 are connected.
- Nodes 7 and 4 are connected.
- Nodes 8 and 1 are connected.
- Nodes 8 and 5 are connected.
- Nodes 9 and 3 are connected.
- Nodes 9 and 5 are connected.

Now, let's find the triangles in this graph:

- Triangles are formed by three nodes connected to each other. 
- Looking at the given edges, we can see that there is one unique triangle formed by the nodes 5, 4, and 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <5, 4, 7>.
