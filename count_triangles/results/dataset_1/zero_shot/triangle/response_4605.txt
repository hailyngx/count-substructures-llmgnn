Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 6, 7>
<5, 8, 6>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
