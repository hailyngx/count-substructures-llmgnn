Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 18 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 8, 9>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 2>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 7, 6>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 1, 8>, <4, 3, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <8, 0, 9>, <8, 9, 0>]
