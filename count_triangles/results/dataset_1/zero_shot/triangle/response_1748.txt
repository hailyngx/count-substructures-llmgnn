Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<6, 8, 9>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
