Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph is calculated by finding the number of unique paths of length 2 between nodes. In this case, we have the following triangles:

<0, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
