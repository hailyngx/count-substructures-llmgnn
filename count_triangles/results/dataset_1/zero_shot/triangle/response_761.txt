Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 2 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
