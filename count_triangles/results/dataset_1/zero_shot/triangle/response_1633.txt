Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
    1 -- 3 -- 2
   /|         /|
  0 |        9 |
   \|         \|
    5 -- 4 -- 7
     \       /
      \     /
        6 - 8
```

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles present. Calculating this manually, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <0, 1, 8>
4. <1, 3, 2>
5. <1, 3, 4>
6. <3, 2, 4>
7. <3, 4, 6>
8. <4, 6, 0>
9. <4, 6, 8>
10. <4, 7, 9>
11. <6, 0, 8>
12. <7, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
