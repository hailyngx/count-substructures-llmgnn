Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 7, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 9, 3>, <4, 6, 2>, <4, 6, 3>.

Therefore, the answer is [8].
