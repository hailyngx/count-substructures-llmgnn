Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the given graph are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, and <6, 8, 9>.

There are a total of 10 triangles in the graph.

So, the final answer is [10].
