Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of paths of length 2 (triangles) that start and end at the same node. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
