Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <2, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, and <6, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
