Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by checking each unique combination of three nodes that are connected by edges. Here is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:

<[1, 3, 9], [1, 4, 9], [1, 4, 3], [1, 9, 2], [0, 3, 9], [0, 3, 1], [2, 3, 9], [2, 6, 5], [8, 9, 5], [7, 9, 5], [7, 9, 3], [7, 3, 9], [6, 2, 9], [6, 5, 8], [5, 4, 1], [5, 8, 9], [5, 8, 3]>
  
Count of triangles = [17]
