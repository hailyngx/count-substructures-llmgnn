Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
