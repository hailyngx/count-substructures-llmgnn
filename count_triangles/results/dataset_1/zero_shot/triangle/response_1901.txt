Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as:

0 --- 1     2     5     6
|     |           |     
5 --- 4 --- 3 --- 8
      |     |     |
      8     9     7

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all possible combinations of nodes that form triangles. Since a triangle consists of three nodes connected to each other, we need to find sets of three nodes where each node is connected to both of the other two nodes in the set.

After examining the graph, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 8, 2>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 9, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 4>
<3, 8, 5>
<4, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
