Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph:
    
    - <0, 1, 9>
    - <1, 6, 8>
    - <1, 6, 7>
    - <1, 7, 9>
    - <6, 4, 7>
    - <7, 5, 9>
