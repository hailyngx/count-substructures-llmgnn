Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 7>.
    
Therefore, there are [4] triangles in total.
