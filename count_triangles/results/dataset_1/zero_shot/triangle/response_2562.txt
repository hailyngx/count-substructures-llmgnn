Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are several triangles in the given graph. Let's list them:

1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <1, 4, 9>
5. <1, 6, 7>
6. <1, 8, 9>
7. <2, 3, 8>
8. <3, 4, 8>
9. <3, 5, 9>
10. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
