Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 18 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
[<0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 7>, <1, 9, 3>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 5>, <5, 7, 8>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
