Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 3, 8>, <6, 8, 9>]
So, the final answer is [13].
