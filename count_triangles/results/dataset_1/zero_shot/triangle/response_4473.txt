Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, and <5, 7, 9>.
