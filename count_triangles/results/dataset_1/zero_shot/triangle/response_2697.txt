Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 1, 9>
<4, 3, 2>
<4, 3, 8>
<4, 5, 2>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 2>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 3>
<4, 8, 7>
<7, 0, 2>
<7, 2, 4>
<7, 2, 8>
<7, 4, 2>
<7, 4, 8>
<7, 8, 3>
<7, 8, 4>
<8, 3, 2>
<8, 4, 2>
<8, 4, 7>
<9, 1, 4>
<9, 7, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [27].
