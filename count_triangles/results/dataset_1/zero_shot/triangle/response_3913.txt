Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 6>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
