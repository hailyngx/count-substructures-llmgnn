Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<2, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 6>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
