Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
