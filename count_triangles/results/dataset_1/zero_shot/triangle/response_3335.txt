Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, 3, 4>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 7, 2>
<1, 9, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 6>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the answer is [7].
