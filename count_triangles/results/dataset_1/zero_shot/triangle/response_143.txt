Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 1>, <2, 8, 5>, <6, 1, 4>, <4, 9, 8>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
