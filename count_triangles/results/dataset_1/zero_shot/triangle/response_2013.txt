Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 7, 8>
<8, 9, 3>

Thus, there are a total of [8] triangles in this graph.
