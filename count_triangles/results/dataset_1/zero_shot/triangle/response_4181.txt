Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
[<0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>]

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
