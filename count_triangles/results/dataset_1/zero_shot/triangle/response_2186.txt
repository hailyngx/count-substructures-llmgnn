Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 7, 8>

There are 6 triangles in total.  
Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
