Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes and edges. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Count of triangles: [8]
