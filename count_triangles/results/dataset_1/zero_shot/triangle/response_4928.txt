Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 17 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles are:  
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<0, 3, 7>  
<1, 4, 7>  
<1, 8, 9>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<3, 7, 9>  
<4, 7, 9>  
<5, 6, 7>  
<5, 6, 7>  
<5, 7, 9>  
<5, 7, 9>  
<6, 7, 9>  
<7, 8, 9>  
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the answer is [17].
