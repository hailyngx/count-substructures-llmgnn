Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
- Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 2 does not form any triangle.
- Node 3 does not form any triangle.
- Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 6 does not form any triangle.
- Node 7 does not form any triangle.
- Node 8 forms triangles with nodes 0, 1, and 3.

Therefore, the unique triangles in the graph are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, and <0, 1, 3>. The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
