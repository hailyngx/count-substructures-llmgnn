Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed within <>:

<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
