Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9> 

Therefore, there are a total of 8 triangles in the graph.  
The answer is: [8]
