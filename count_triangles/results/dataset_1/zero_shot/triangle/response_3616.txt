Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [10] triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 8, 9>]
