Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 0, 8>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the graph. So, the final answer is [4].
