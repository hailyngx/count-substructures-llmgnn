Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
We will count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Let's use the fact that a triangle is formed when there is an edge between every pair of three nodes. Therefore, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected.

By observing the edges given, we can identify the following triangles:
1. Triangle 1: <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 8, 6>
3. Triangle 3: <1, 3, 5>
4. Triangle 4: <1, 4, 8>
5. Triangle 5: <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
