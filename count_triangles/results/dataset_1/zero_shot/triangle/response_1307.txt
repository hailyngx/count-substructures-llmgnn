Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be formed by finding nodes that are connected to each other forming a closed loop of three edges. 

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 7>  
<0, 7, 9>  
<0, 2, 9>  
<3, 1, 4>  
<3, 4, 8>  
<4, 5, 8>  
<5, 7, 9>  

There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is: [7].
