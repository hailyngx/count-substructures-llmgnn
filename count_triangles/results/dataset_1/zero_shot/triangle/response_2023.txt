Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 2>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, and <2, 4, 8>.
