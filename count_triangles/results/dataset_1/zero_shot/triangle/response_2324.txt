Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 9, 8> unique triangles in the graph. Hence, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
