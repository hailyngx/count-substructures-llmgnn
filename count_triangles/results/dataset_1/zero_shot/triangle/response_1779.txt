Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 4>
<5, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 4>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
