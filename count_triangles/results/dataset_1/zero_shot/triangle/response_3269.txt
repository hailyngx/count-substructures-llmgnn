Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

[<0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <7, 5, 1>, <9, 4, 2>]

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the graph. [10]
