Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

<1, 0, 3>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 1, 3>
<4, 8, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
