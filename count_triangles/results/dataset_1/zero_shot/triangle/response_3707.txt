Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the graph. 

The answer is: [11]
