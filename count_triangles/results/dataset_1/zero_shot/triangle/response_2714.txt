Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
