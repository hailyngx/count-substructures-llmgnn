Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 3>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<8, 5, 9>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
