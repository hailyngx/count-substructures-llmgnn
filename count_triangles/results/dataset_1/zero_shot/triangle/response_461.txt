Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the unique triangles formed by each set of three connected nodes. 

The triangles in this graph are: 
<0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
