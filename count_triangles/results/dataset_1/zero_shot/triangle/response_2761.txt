Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The unique triangles in this graph are <0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 6>, and <3, 6, 9>.
    
    Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
