Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the structure as illustrated below:

```
0 -- 3 -- 5 -- 8
|    |    |    |
6 -- 2 -- 4 -- 7 -- 9
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

We can observe that the triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <2, 4, 6>
5. <2, 6, 9>
6. <3, 5, 7>
7. <4, 6, 8>
8. <5, 7, 8>
9. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in total. The answer is [9].
