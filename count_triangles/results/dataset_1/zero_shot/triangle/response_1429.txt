Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 0>
<3, 2, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
