Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 7, 3>
<6, 0, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
