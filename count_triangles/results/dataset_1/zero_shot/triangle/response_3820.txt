Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 unique triangles in this graph. The triangles are as follows:
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
