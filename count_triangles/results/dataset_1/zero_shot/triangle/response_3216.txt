Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by looking at the connected triads of vertices. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 2, 7>, <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
