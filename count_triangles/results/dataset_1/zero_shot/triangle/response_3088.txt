Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [8].

The unique triangles are <0, 5, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <2, 5, 0>, <2, 5, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 0>.
