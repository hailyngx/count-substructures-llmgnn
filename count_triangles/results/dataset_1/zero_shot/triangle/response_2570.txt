Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

The triangles in the given graph:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 2, 7>
- [3]

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
