Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 9, 4>
<2, 9, 5>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in total. The answer is [4].
