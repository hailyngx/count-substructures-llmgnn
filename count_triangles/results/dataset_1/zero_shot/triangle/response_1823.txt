Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: <1, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
