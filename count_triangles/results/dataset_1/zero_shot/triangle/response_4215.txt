Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by examining each set of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's find the triangles in the given graph:

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
