Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 2, 4>
<2, 6, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
