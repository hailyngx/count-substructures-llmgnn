Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
