Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 7, 2>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 5>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 3, 9>, <6, 5, 7>

There are a total of 13 triangles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [13].
