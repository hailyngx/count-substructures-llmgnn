Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

[<0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 9, 1>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 2, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <2, 9, 4>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 5, 0>, <5, 1, 7>, <4, 9, 1>, <4, 9, 0>, <4, 9, 2>, <3, 6, 5>]

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
