Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
