Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 9, 1>
Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the graph.
