Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are with the nodes inside < >:

[<0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>]
