Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 17 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found: 

[<1, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 3, 9>, <5, 4, 9>, <5, 6, 3>, <5, 6, 4>, <5, 6, 3>, <7, 1, 9>, <7, 4, 9>, <7, 4, 8>, <8, 4, 7>, <9, 1, 7>, <9, 3, 5>, <9, 4, 7>]  

Therefore, the final answer is [17].
