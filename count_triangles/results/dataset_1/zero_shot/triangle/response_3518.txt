Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 4, 3>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
