Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of closed loops of length 3.

Upon examining the given graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.

Let's find the triangles by examining all possible paths of length 2 starting from each node and check for closures:
- For Node 0: (0,1,0), (0,2,0), (0,8,0), (0,9,0) - None
- For Node 1: (1,0,1), (1,4,1), (1,6,1), (1,7,1), (1,8,1) - <0,1,8>
- For Node 2: (2,0,2), (2,3,2), (2,5,2), (2,8,2) - None
- For Node 3: (3,2,3), (3,8,3) - None
- For Node 4: (4,1,4), (4,5,4) - None
- For Node 5: (5,2,5), (5,4,5) - None
- For Node 6: (6,1,6), (6,8,6) - None
- For Node 7: (7,1,7) - None
- For Node 8: (8,0,8), (8,1,8), (8,2,8), (8,3,8), (8,6,8), (8,9,8) - <0,1,8>, <8,9,0>
- For Node 9: (9,0,9), (9,8,9) - None

Thus, we have found two unique triangles: <0, 1, 8> and <8, 9, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
