Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be calculated based on the number of triangles each node participates in. Let's list all the unique triangles we can find:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 4>
<4, 8, 2>
<6, 9, 2>

There are 10 unique triangles in total, so the answer is [10].
