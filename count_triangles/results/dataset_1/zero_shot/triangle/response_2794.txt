Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 - 4
   /|  |
  5 |  7 - 8
   \|  |/ 
    2 - 3
       /
      9
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will list them first:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 3, 2>
4. <0, 3, 7>
5. <0, 6, 7>
6. <0, 7, 4>
7. <0, 7, 5>
8. <1, 4, 5>
9. <2, 3, 7>
10. <2, 5, 7>
11. <2, 5, 8>
12. <2, 5, 4>
13. <2, 7, 4>
14. <2, 7, 8>
15. <3, 7, 4>
16. <5, 7, 4>
17. <5, 7, 8>

Thus, there are a total of 17 unique triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [17].
