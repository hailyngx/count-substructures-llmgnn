Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles present in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 7, 4>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
