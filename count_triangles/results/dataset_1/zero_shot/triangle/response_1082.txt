Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
   1 -- 8 -- 2 -- 9
   |         |    |
   3 -- 0 -- 4    5
     \      |  
       7 -- 6
```

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:  

1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
  
Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [4].
