Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node creates.

\[Number \ of \ Triangles = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(d_i - 1)(d_i - 2)\]

Where \(d_i\) represents the degree of node i.

Calculating the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 3

Plugging the degrees into the formula:
\[Number \ of \ Triangles = \frac{1}{6} (3(3-1)(3-2) + 2(2-1)(2-2) + 3(3-1)(3-2) + 2(2-1)(2-2) + 3(3-1)(3-2) + 2(2-1)(2-2) + 3(3-1)(3-2) + 4(4-1)(4-2) + 3(3-1)(3-2) + 3(3-1)(3-2))\]
\[Number \ of \ Triangles = \frac{1}{6} (18 + 0 + 18 + 0 + 18 + 0 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 18)\]
\[Number \ of \ Triangles = \frac{1}{6} (126)\]
\[Number \ of \ Triangles = 21\]

Therefore, there are 21 triangles in the given graph. Listing the unique triangles:
\[ [ <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 1, 9>, <7, 5, 8> ] \]
