Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, and <1, 8, 9> triangles in the graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
