Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
