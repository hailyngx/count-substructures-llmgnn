Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be calculated by counting the unique triangles formed by every set of three nodes that are interconnected.

There are several triangles that can be identified in this graph:
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [(11)].
