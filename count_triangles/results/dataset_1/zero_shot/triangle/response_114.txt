Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by looking for cycles of length 3. Let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangles involving node 1:
   - <1, 3, 8>

2. Triangles involving node 3:
   - <1, 3, 8>

3. Triangles involving node 4: None

4. Triangles involving node 6: None

5. Triangles involving node 7: None

6. Triangles involving node 8:
   - <1, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1]. The unique triangle found is <1, 3, 8>.
