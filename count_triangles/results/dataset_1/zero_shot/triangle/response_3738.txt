Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>.
