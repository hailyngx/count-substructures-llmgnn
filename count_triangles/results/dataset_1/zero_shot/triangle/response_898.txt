Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
By using the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<2, 1, 3>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
