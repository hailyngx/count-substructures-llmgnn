Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 2, 4>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>
Therefore, there are 6 triangles in total.
