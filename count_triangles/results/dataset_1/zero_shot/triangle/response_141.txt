Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 1 -- 5
|    |    |
2 -- 4 -- 3
| /      | /
6        7
```

To calculate the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all possible triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. 

There are 7 unique triangles in this graph. 
Therefore, the answer is:

[7]
