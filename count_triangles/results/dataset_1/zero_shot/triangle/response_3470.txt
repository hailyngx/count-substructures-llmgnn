Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 6>
<4, 2, 7>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
