Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph:
<0, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
