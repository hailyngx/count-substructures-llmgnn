Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles in the graph:
<1, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 4>.
So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
