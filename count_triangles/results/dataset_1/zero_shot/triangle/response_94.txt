Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by a set of three nodes connected by edges. 

Upon analyzing the graph provided, the unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
