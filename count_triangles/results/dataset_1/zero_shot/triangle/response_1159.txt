Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

```
    1 -- 7
   /|   /|
  0----4 |
  |\ |  | |
  | 8--6 5
  | /   |/
  3 -- 9
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles. The triangles are formed by 3 nodes connected by edges.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The final answer is: [8]
