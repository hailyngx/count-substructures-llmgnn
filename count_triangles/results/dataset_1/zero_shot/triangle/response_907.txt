Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangle in a graph consists of three vertices connected by edges. Let's find the number of unique triangles in the given graph.

<0, 1, 2>  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 2, 8>  
<0, 5, 4>  
<1, 2, 4>  
<1, 2, 7>  
<1, 2, 8>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<2, 4, 9>  
<4, 5, 6>  
<4, 7, 6>  
<7, 2, 8>  

Hence, there are 12 unique triangles in the given graph.
