Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<8, 1, 7>
<8, 1, 9>
<8, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
