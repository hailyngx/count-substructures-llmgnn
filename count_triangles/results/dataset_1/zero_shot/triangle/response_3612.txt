Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of [6] triangles. The unique triangles found are:

<2, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
