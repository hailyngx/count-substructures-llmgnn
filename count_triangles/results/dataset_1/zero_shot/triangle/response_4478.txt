Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>]

Number of triangles: [6]
