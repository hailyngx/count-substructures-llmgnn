Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>

There are a total of 3 triangles in the given graph. Thus, the final answer is [3].
