Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
