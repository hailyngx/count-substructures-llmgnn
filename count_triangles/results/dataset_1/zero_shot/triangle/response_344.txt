Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 6>
<8, 0, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 2>
<4, 6, 7>
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
