Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 6, 9>, <0, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
