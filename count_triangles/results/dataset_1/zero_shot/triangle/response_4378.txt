Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by looking for closed loops of size 3. Here, a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Inspecting the provided graph, we can count the following unique triangles:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 1>
<2, 1, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<6, 4, 7>
<9, 1, 2>
<9, 2, 3>
<9, 6, 4>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
