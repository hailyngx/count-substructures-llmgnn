Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of closed triangles of nodes. A triangle exists when three nodes are connected to each other.
    
    In this graph, we can find the following triangles:
    
    - <0, 4, 7>
    - <1, 8, 2>
    - <2, 7, 4>
    
    Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
