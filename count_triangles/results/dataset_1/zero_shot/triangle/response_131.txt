Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The list of unique triangles in the given graph:
<[0, 1, 2], [4, 5, 8]> 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
