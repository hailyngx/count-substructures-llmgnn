Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 6, 2>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 8, 0>
<2, 8, 3>
<2, 9, 3>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 8, 5>
<3, 9, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 8, 0>
<5, 9, 3>
<6, 0, 2>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 2, 0>
<6, 2, 1>
<6, 2, 8>
<6, 3, 7>
<6, 7, 1>
<7, 1, 2>
<7, 3, 6>
<8, 0, 2>
<8, 3, 9>
<9, 3, 6>
<9, 3, 8>
<9, 5, 8>

Thus, there are 27 triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [27].
