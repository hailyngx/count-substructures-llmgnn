Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
<[0, 1, 3]>
<[1, 5, 6]>
<[1, 6, 9]>
<[3, 6, 9]>
<[0, 3, 6]>
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
