Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 8>.
    Therefore, there are [3] triangles in total.
