Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles found:
[<0, 2, 3>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 5>, <2, 0, 3>, <2, 0, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 0, 1>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 1, 8>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 8, 1>]
