Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [12] triangles in the graph.
