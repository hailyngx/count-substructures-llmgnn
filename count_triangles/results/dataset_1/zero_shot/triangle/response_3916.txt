Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 7, 9>, <3, 1, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <7, 8, 9>.
