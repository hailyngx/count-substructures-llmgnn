Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 unique triangles in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].

The unique triangles are: <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.
