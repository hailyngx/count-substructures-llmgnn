Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <6, 4, 9>

There are a total of 8 triangles in the graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
