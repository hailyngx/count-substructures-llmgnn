Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <4, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [4].
