Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 8, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
