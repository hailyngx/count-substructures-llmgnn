Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 5>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<4, 8, 5>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 8, 5>

There are a total of 11 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
