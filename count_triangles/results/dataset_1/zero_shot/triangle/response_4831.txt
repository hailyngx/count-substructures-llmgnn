Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 18 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:

<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 4, 2>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 4>
<4, 6, 2>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 2, 8>
<6, 3, 4>
<7, 1, 5>
<8, 1, 7>
<9, 0, 2>
<9, 2, 4>
<9, 4, 0>

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
