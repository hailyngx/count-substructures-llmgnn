Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 1>, <7, 9, 1>, <7, 8, 9>.
