Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting how many sets of three nodes are all connected to each other. 

For the given graph:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <3, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
