Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph. The list of unique triangles is as follows:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<8, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
