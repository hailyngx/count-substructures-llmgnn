Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<2, 0, 3>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 7, 6>
<7, 9, 1>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
