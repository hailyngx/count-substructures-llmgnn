Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <8, 9, 1>

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
