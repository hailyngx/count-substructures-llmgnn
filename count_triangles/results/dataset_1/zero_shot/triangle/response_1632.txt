Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by nodes. 

After examining the graph, the triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Counting them, we find that there are a total of 16 unique triangles in the given graph. Thus, the answer is [16].
