Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 1, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
