Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [10].
