Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
    0 -- 5         4 -- 6
    |    |         |    
    8 -- 2 -- 7 -- 1 -- 3
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph:
- Node 0: Connects with nodes 2, 5, and 8
- Node 1: Connects with nodes 3 and 7
- Node 2: Connects with nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8
- Node 3: Connects with nodes 1, 7, and 2
- Node 4: Connects with nodes 5 and 6
- Node 5: Connects with nodes 0, 2, and 4
- Node 6: Connects with node 4
- Node 7: Connects with nodes 1, 2, and 3
- Node 8: Connects with nodes 0, 2

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 7, 2>
3. <2, 5, 0>
4. <2, 7, 3>
5. <4, 5, 0>
6. <4, 6, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
