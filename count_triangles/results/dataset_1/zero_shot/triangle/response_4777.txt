Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 7, 3>
<7, 9, 0>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [5].
