Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found: <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 5, 0>.
