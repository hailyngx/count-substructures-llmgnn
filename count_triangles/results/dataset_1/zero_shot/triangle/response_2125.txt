Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph, and they are:  
<0, 2, 8>  
<1, 4, 5>  
<2, 4, 5>  
<2, 4, 8>  
<4, 6, 9>  
<6, 7, 9>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<2, 5, 1>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
