Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in this graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
[<0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <6, 8, 9>]
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
