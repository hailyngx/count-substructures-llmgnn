Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of triangles each node is part of and then dividing by 3 since each triangle is counted 3 times.

Calculating the number of triangles for each node:
- Node 0 is part of 0 triangles.
- Node 1 is part of 0 triangles.
- Node 2 is part of 2 triangles: <2, 4, 5> and <2, 5, 9>.
- Node 3 is part of 7 triangles: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <4, 5, 3>, <5, 3, 6>, and <5, 3, 7>.
- Node 4 is part of 6 triangles: <0, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 2>, <2, 4, 3>, <3, 4, 7>, <5, 4, 1>, and <5, 4, 2>.
- Node 5 is part of 6 triangles: <1, 5, 2>, <2, 5, 3>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 2>, and <5, 3, 6>.
- Node 6 is part of 3 triangles: <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 8>, and <3, 5, 6>.
- Node 7 is part of 3 triangles: <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 4>, and <3, 5, 7>.
- Node 8 is part of 1 triangle: <2, 6, 8>.
- Node 9 is part of 2 triangles: <1, 9, 2> and <2, 5, 9>.

Adding up the total number of triangles for each node, we get:
0 triangles + 0 triangles + 2 triangles + 7 triangles + 6 triangles + 6 triangles + 3 triangles + 3 triangles + 1 triangle + 2 triangles = 30 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [30] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 2>, <3, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 2>, <4, 5, 1>, <3, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 4>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 6, 8>.
