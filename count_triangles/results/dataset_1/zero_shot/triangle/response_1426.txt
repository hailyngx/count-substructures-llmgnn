Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
