Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of unique triangles in the given graph can be counted as follows:

1. Triangle involving node 0:
   - Nodes: 0, 4, 5
   <0, 4, 5>

2. Triangle involving node 1:
   - No triangles involving node 1.

3. Triangle involving node 2:
   - No triangles involving node 2.

4. Triangle involving node 3:
   - No triangles involving node 3.

5. Triangle involving node 4:
   - No additional triangles involving node 4.

6. Triangle involving node 5:
   - Node 0 is already considered, so no new triangles with node 5.

7. Triangle involving node 6:
   - No additional triangles involving node 6.

8. Triangle involving node 7:
   - No triangles involving node 7.

9. Triangle involving node 8:
   - No triangles involving node 8.

10. Triangle involving node 9:
   - No additional triangles involving node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 1, and the unique triangle is <0, 4, 5>.
Thus, the final answer is [1].
