Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by each unique set of three connected nodes.

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 4>
<5, 6, 2>
<8, 4, 9>

Counting these unique triangles, we find that there are 12 triangles in total within the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
