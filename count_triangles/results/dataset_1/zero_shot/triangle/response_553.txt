Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of connected paths with three edges. Here are the unique triangles present in the given graph:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
