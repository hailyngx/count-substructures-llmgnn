Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all possible triangles formed by 3 connected nodes.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
