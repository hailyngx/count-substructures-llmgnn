Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<8, 9, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
