Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes where each node is connected to the other two. Let's list out the unique triangles:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>
