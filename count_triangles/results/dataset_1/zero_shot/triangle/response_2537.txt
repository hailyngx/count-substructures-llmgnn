Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all the unique combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges.

There are 8 unique triangles in this graph:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 4>
<6, 3, 9>
<7, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
