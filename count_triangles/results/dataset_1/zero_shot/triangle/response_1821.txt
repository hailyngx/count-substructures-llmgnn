Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. 

After checking the connections between each node, the unique triangles found in the given graph are:
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 1, 5>
<2, 1, 7>
<2, 4, 0>
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 1, 7>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 0, 5>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 1, 7>
<5, 1, 9>
<6, 3, 5>
<6, 5, 7>
<6, 5, 9>
<7, 1, 5>
<7, 1, 9>
<9, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph, as counted above, is [25].
