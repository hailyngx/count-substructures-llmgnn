Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 - 6
   /|   |\
  8 |   | 2
 / \|   |/
0 - 7 - 3
 \ |   |
  4 - 5
       |
       9
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for cycles of length 3. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <0, 5, 8>
5. <1, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
