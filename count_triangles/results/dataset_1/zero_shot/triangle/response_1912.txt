Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangle in a graph refers to a set of three vertices in which each vertex is connected to the other two vertices. Let's find the number of triangles in this graph.

From the given graph, the unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
