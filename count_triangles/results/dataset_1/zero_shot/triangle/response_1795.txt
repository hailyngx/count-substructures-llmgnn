Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the edges. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 6, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 5>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<8, 9, 6>

Counting the number of unique triangles gives us a total of 15 triangles.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
