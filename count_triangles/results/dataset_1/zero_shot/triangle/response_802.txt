Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 6.

The unique triangles are:
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
