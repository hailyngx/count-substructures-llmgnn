Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles present in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
