Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by checking all possible triangles formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in a cyclic manner.

Given the graph, we can visualize the triangles as follows:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle 4: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle 6: <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle 7: <3, 0, 8>
- Triangle 8: <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle 9: <5, 6, 8>
- Triangle 10: <5, 6, 9>
- Triangle 11: <8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
