Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of closed paths of length 3 which can be formed by three nodes. Each triangle is counted as three separate cycles. 

Counting the number of triangles can be quite complex, especially in larger graphs. I will start counting the triangles in the given graph.

After examining the graph, the triangles found are:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 3, 8>
4. <0, 1, 2>
5. <1, 2, 7>
6. <1, 6, 7>
7. <2, 7, 3>
8. <2, 7, 5>
9. <3, 7, 5>
10. <3, 9, 4>
11. <3, 7, 6>
12. <4, 9, 5>
13. <5, 7, 6>
14. <5, 6, 1>
15. <6, 1, 2>
16. <6, 2, 7>
17. <8, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
