Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
    0 -- 3     6 -- 1
    |    |     |    |
    9    2 -- 7  -- 8
         |    |    |
         5    4    2
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two. After examining the given edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <0, 3, 2>
3. <1, 6, 5>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <1, 7, 2>
6. <1, 7, 5>
7. <1, 8, 2>
8. <2, 3, 7>
9. <2, 4, 2>
10. <2, 8, 1>
11. <2, 8, 7>
12. <2, 8, 2>
13. <2, 9, 5>
14. <2, 9, 0>
15. <3, 7, 5>
16. <7, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [16].
