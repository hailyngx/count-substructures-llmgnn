Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

[<1, 2, 3>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <5, 9, 6>]
So, the final answer is [5].
