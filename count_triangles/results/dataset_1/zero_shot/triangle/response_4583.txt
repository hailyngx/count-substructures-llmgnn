Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

[<0, 2, 4>]

There is 1 triangle in total. So, the final answer is [1].
