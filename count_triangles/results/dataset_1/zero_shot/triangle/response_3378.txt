Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<2, 1, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<8, 9, 6>

Therefore, the answer is [6].
