Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: 

<1, 2, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<6, 4, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
