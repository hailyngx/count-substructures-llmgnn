Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 2>
<2, 3, 9>
<7, 3, 5>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [4].
