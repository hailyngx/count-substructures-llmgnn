Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of unique paths of length 2 between nodes. A path of length 2 forms a triangle in the graph.

After analyzing the provided graph, the triangles can be listed as follows:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
