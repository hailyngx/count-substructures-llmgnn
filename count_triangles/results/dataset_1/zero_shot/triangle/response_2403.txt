Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the graph.
