Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:  
<0, 1, 8>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<0, 7, 2>  
<0, 7, 4>  
<0, 7, 5>  
<1, 8, 9>  
<2, 5, 3>  
<5, 7, 2>  
<5, 7, 9>  

Total number of triangles: [9]
