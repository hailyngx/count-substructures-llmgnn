Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by connecting three nodes. Let's list out the triangles in the graph:

1. <1, 5, 9>
2. <1, 6, 2>
3. <5, 1, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
