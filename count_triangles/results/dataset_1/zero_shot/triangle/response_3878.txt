Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by identifying all the unique triangles based on the given edges. 

Counting the total number of triangles can be time-consuming, we can list all the unique triangles and then count them. 

The unique triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 8, 6>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 9, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 2, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 5>
<7, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
