Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 9>
<4, 2, 5>
<4, 2, 6>
<5, 2, 6>
<5, 6, 9>

There are 13 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [13].
