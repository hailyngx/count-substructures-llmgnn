Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 1, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
