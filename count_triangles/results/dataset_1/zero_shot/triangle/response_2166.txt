Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 9>
<3, 2, 8>
<5, 6, 4>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 0>
<8, 4, 6>
<8, 4, 9>
<8, 9, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph. Thus, the answer is [12].
