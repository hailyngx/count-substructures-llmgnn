Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated using the formula for counting triangles in a simple undirected graph: 

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(d_i-1)(d_i-2) \]

where \( d_i \) is the degree of node \( i \) and \( n \) is the total number of nodes.

Calculating the degrees for each node:

- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 1 

Now, we can substitute these values in the formula to find the number of triangles:

\[ = \frac{1}{6} \left[(3 \times 2 \times 1) + (2 \times 1 \times 0) + (1 \times 0 \times 1) + (5 \times 4 \times 3) + (2 \times 1 \times 0) + (3 \times 2 \times 1) + (4 \times 3 \times 2) + (3 \times 2 \times 1) + (1 \times 0 \times 1)\right] \]

\[ = \frac{1}{6} \left[6 + 0 + 0 + 60 + 0 + 6 + 24 + 6 + 0\right] \]

\[ = \frac{102}{6} = 17 \]

There are 17 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [17]
