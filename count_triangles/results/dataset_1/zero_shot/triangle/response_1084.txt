Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 21 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found: [<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 2, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 7, 6>, <5, 0, 1>, <5, 1, 7>, <6, 2, 7>, <7, 4, 0>, <7, 5, 0>, <7, 6, 2>, <9, 2, 6>, <9, 2, 7>, <9, 6, 7>].

Therefore, the final answer is [21].
