Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 1, 3>, <5, 1, 8>, <5, 3, 8>, <8, 5, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
