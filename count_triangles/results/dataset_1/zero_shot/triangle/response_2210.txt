Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of triangles each node is part of. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

[<0, 4, 5>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <8, 9, 2>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
