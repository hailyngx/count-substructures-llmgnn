Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 0, 3>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 2, 6>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 9, 8>
<6, 3, 9>

[There are 10 unique triangles in total.]
