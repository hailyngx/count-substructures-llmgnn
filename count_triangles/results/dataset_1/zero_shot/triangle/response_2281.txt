Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [12].
