Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is [<<0, 3, 5>>, <<1, 3, 6>>, <<3, 2, 5>>]. There are a total of [3] triangles.
