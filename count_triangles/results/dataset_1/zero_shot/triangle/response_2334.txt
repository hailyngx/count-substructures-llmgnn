Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The list of unique triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 0, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 4, 5>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in this graph.
