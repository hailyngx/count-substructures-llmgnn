Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

    0 --- 1
    |     |
    |     |
    2 --- 3
    |     |
    |     |
    9 --- 6
    |  /  |
    4 --- 5 --- 7 --- 8
    
Let's count the number of triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 3>
- Triangle 3: <0, 2, 3>
- Triangle 4: <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle 6: <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle 7: <5, 6, 7>
- Triangle 8: <6, 7, 9>

Hence, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [8].
