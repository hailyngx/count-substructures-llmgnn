Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
[<2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 7, 8>]

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
