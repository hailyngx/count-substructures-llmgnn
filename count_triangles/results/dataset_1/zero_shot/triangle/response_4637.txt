Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

[<1, 8, 5>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 9, 5>, <7, 3, 9>, <7, 8, 5>, <7, 8, 9>]
