Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<2, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in total.
