Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles found: 

<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
