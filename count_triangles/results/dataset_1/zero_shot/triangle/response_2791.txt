Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected by edges.

From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <6, 5, 1>
3. <6, 5, 2>
4. <6, 7, 0>
5. <6, 7, 2>
6. <6, 7, 5>
7. <8, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
