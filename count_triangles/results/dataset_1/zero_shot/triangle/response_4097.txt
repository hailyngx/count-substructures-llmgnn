Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
By analyzing the given graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can identify the following triangles:

1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <1, 4, 2>
3. <1, 8, 6>
4. <2, 4, 5>
5. <6, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph, which can be shown as [5].
