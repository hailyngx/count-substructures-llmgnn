Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of 18 triangles in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [18].
