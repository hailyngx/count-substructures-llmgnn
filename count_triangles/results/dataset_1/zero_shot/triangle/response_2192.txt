Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are total of [24] triangles in this graph.

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 4> 

Therefore, the answer is [10].
