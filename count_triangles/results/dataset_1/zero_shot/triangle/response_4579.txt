Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are <0, 7, 4>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 5>, <0, 9, 6>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 1, 2>, <4, 1, 3>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 2, 3>, <4, 2, 7>, <4, 2, 9>, <4, 3, 7>, <4, 3, 9>, <4, 7, 9> triangles in this graph. Hence, the total number of triangles is [17].
