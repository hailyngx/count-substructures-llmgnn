Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 0, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
