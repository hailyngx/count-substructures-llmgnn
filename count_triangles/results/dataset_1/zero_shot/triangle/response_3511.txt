Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 4>
<4, 6, 9>
<7, 0, 2>
<7, 2, 9>
<7, 8, 3>
<8, 3, 5>
<9, 4, 6>
<9, 6, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
