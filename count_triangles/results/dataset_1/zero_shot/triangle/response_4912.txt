Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<1, 3, 7>
Therefore, the final answer is [16].
