Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by examining the triangles formed by each set of three connected nodes.

There are several triangles in the graph:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 2, 6>
<3, 7, 2>

Counting all the unique triangles, we get a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
