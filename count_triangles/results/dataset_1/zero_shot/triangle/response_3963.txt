Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique triangles are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, and <4, 6, 8>.
