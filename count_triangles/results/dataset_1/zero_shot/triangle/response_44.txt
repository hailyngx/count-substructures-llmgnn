Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

0 -- 9 <br>
| <br>
9 <br>
| <br>
1 -- 4 -- 3 <br>
|    / | <br>
|  /  | <br>
|/    | <br>
2 -- 5 -- 7 <br>
| <br>
6 <br>
|
8

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

There are 5 triangles in total: <0, 1, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <5, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
