Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are:
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 8, 5>
<4, 9, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
