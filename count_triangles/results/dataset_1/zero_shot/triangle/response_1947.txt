Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by identifying each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can count the triangles in the given graph based on the provided edges. 

After examining the graph, the triangles formed by the edges are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 8, 2>
<6, 9, 0>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
