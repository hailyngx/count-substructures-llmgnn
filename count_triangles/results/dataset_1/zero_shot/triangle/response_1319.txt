Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 8 unique triangles in this graph. 

The triangles are:
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 0, 7>
<4, 0, 9>
<4, 6, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
