Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is 9.
