Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, and <4, 2, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
