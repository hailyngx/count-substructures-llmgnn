Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<1, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [6].
