Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 0, 2>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 9, 3>, <2, 0, 5>, <5, 4, 6>, <6, 7, 4>, <6, 8, 9>.

Therefore, there are a total of 7 unique triangles in the graph. 

The final answer is [7].
