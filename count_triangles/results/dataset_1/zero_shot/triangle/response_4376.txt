Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:
```
    1 -- 2
   /|\   | \
  0 | 8 | 9
   \|/   |/
    3 -- 5
   /|    |
  6 |    |
   \|    |
    7 -- 4
```

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected. Let's calculate the number of triangles.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <0, 8, 7>
5. <1, 2, 8>
6. <2, 7, 8>
7. <7, 8, 9> 

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is 7. Hence, the final answer is [7].
