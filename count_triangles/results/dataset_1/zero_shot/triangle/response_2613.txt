Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [14] triangles in the given graph.  

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 6>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>
