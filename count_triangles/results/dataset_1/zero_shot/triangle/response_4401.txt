Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are total of 3 triangles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 3, 4>, <4, 7, 9>, and <4, 8, 9>.
