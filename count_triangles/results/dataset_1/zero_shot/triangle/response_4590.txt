Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
