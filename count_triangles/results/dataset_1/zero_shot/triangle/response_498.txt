Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by examining the number of triangles each node is a part of. 

Upon analyzing the given graph, we can find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
