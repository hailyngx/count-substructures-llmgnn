Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The unique triangles found in the given graph are: 

<0, 4, 1>
<0, 5, 0>
<1, 4, 0>
<3, 9, 2>
<3, 9, 6>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
