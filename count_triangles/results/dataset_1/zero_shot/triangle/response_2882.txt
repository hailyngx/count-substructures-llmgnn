Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

[<0, 2, 9>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 4>, <7, 9, 0>]
