Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph has the following unique triangles:
<1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in total.
