Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 9, 0>

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the graph. So, the answer is [7].
