Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles listed inside brackets:

[<0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 0, 1>, <5, 1, 8>]
