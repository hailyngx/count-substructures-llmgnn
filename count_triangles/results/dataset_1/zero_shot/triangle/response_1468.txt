Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 1>
<7, 9, 2>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 1>
<2, 9, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 1>
<7, 1, 2>
<7, 2, 9>
<8, 6, 1>
<8, 9, 2>
<9, 7, 1>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
