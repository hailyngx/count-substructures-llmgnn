Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [10]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
