Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed below with their node numbers:

[<0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 0, 2>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 0, 1>, <2, 0, 7>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <8, 0, 3>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
