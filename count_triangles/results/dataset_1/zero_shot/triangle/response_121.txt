Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<1, 0, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 1, 4>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<8, 4, 6>
<8, 4, 1>
<8, 6, 7>
<8, 6, 1>

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
