Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be formed by finding nodes that are connected to each other with three edges. Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <3, 1, 5>
3. Triangle <7, 9, 0>

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [3].
