Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets []:

[<0, 1, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 7>]
