Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i} deg(v_i) \left( deg(v_i) - 1 \right) \left( deg(v_i) - 2 \right) \]

where \( deg(v_i) \) represents the degree of the \( i \)th node in the graph.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's calculate the number of triangles:

- Node 0 has a degree of 4
- Node 1 has a degree of 1
- Node 2 has a degree of 5
- Node 4 has a degree of 4
- Node 5 has a degree of 4
- Node 6 has a degree of 3
- Node 7 has a degree of 2
- Node 8 has a degree of 5
- Node 9 has a degree of 3

Now, substituting the degrees into the formula:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \left( 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 0 \cdot -1 + 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 + 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 + 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \right) \]
\[ = \frac{1}{6} \left( 24 + 0 + 60 + 24 + 24 + 6 + 0 + 60 + 6 \right) \]
\[ = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 204 \]
\[ = 34 \]

Therefore, the graph has a total of 34 triangles. The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 9, 4>, <6, 0, 8>, <8, 6, 0>, <8, 5, 9>, <8, 6, 0>, <9, 5, 4>, <9, 5, 8>. 

Thus, the final answer is: [34].
