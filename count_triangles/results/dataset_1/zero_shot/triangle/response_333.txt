Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<8, 1, 9>
<8, 3, 9>
<8, 6, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
