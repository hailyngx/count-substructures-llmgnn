Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:  

<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 3, 7>  
<0, 5, 1>  
<1, 4, 6>  
<1, 5, 2>  
<7, 8, 4>  

Total number of triangles: 6  
So, the final answer is [6].
