Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:

[<1, 5, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 7, 8>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
