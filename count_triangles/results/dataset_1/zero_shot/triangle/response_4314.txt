Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 8, 3>
<2, 6, 5>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
