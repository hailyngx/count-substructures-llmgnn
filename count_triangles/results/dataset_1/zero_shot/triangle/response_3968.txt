Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph consists of the following triangles:

<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 0>
<3, 5, 1>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 7>
<5, 0, 1>
<5, 0, 8>
<5, 1, 8>
<6, 3, 9>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
