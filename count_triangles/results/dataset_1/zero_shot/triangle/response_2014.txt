Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected.

By examining the given edges, the following unique triangles can be identified:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 2>
3. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <3, 0, 6>
6. Triangle <3, 8, 2>
7. Triangle <4, 0, 6>
8. Triangle <6, 1, 5>
9. Triangle <7, 5, 2>
10. Triangle <8, 2, 3>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [10].
