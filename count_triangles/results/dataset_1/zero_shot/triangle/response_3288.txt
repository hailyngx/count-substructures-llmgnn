Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 8 triangles. 

The unique triangles are: 
<1, 2, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
