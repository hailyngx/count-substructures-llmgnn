Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
