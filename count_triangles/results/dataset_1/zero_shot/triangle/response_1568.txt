Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 8, 4>, <1, 8, 7>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 9, 7> (10 triangles in total).
