Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the given edges. 

Upon examining the graph, the unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
  
Counting the total number of unique triangles found, we get 10 triangles in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
