Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 8, 4>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 7, 5>
<2, 7, 9>
<6, 5, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
