Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 5>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 1, 8>
<5, 2, 3>
<6, 4, 7>
<8, 1, 5>
<8, 5, 9>

There are 11 unique triangles in total. Therefore, the answer is [11].
