Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [10] triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>]
