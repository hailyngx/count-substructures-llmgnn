Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The possible triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
