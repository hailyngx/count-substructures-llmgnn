Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 0, 6>
<4, 1, 7>
<6, 0, 7>
<6, 8, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
