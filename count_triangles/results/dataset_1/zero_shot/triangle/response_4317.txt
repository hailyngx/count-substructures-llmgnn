Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by counting how many sets of three nodes are mutually connected by edges.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 3, 5>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 5, 6>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 8, 9>
4. Triangle 4: <2, 3, 7>
5. Triangle 5: <2, 7, 9>
6. Triangle 6: <3, 5, 6>
7. Triangle 7: <4, 9, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. The answer is [7].
