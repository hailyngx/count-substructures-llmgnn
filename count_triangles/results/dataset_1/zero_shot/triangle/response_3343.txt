Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
