Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

```
  9 --- 2       7
   \    |       |
     \  |       |
       \v       v
        6 --- 5 --- 3
         \   |   / |
           \ | /   |
             0 --- 1
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. 

After analyzing the graph, we find that the following triangles exist:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [9].
