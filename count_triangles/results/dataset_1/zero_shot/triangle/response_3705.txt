Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 6, 4>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 9, 7>, <0, 9, 8>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 5, 1>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 0>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
