Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
