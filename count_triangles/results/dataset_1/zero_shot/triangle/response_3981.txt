Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 3>
<4, 1, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 0, 9>
<6, 2, 7>
<6, 3, 9>
<7, 2, 4>
<7, 4, 9>
<9, 0, 1>
<9, 0, 3>
<9, 1, 4>
<9, 1, 7>
<9, 3, 6>
<9, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
