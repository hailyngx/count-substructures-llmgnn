Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <2, 8, 3>, <2, 8, 5>  
So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
