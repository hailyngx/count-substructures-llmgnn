Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by selecting 3 nodes out of the 10 nodes. To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the given edges.

The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 4. So, the final answer is [4].
