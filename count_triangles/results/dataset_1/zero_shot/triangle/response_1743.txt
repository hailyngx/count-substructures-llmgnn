Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are:
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
