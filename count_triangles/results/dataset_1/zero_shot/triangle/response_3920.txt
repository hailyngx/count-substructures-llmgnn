Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

[<0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>]
