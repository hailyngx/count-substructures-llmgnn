Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed within brackets []:

[<0, 2, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>]
