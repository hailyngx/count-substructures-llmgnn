Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, and <2, 5, 6>.
