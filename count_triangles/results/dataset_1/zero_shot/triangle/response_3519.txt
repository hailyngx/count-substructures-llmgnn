Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 5>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 6, 0>, <8, 4, 6>.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
