Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 2, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 7>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
