Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph would be as follows:

[<1, 2, 7> <1, 4, 7> <3, 5, 9> <6, 7, 8> <7, 8, 9>]

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
