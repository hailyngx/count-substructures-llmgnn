Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes that form a triangle.

Let's identify the triangles:
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
