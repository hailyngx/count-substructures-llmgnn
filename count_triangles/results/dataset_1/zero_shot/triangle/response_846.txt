Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by each triplet of nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other by edges. 

Upon examining the given graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
- <0, 7, 8>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <7, 8, 9>

Hence, there are 4 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
