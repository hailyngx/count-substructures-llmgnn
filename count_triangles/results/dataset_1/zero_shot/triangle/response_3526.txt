Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, 1, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, and <6, 7, 9> triangles in this graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
