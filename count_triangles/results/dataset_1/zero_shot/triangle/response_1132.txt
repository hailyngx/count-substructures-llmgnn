Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are as follows: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 7>, <4, 3, 5>.
Therefore, the final answer is [7].
