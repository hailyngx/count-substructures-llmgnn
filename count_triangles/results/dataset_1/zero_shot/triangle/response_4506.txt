Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 6, 0>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 2>
<5, 3, 0>
<5, 8, 7>
<8, 9, 8>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
