Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by identifying all the cycles of length 3 in the graph.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
