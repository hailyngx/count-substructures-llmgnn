Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets:

[<0, 1, 6> <1, 3, 6> <1, 8, 5> <2, 1, 3> <2, 3, 5> <2, 3, 9> <2, 4, 9> <3, 5, 8>]
