Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in total.  
Hence, the final answer is [5].
