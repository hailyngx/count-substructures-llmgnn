Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles in this graph:
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 9, 3>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 9, 3>
<5, 3, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
