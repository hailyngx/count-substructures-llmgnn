Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [14] triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 4>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 6, 1>, <3, 1, 5>, <3, 2, 6>, <3, 5, 4>, <4, 1, 9>, <5, 1, 6>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 1, 5>]
