Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 6>
Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
