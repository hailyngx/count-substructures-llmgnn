Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph described has 10 nodes and 32 edges. To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by the three nodes.

After analyzing the given edges, we can list the triangles as follows:
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 3, 4>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 0, 6>
<7, 2, 6>

There are a total of 7 unique triangles in the graph described. Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
