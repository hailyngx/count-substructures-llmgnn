Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of closed loops of length 3 (triangles).

By examining the given edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 1, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
