Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
We can count the number of triangles in the graph by checking each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle. 

By examining the given edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
