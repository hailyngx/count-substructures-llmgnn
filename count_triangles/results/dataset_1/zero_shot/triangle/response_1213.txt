Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here is a list of the unique triangles found:

[<3, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 8>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
