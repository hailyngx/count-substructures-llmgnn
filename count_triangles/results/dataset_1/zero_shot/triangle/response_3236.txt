Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 0>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 0>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 9, 0>
<5, 9, 2>

There are a total of [11] triangles in the graph.
