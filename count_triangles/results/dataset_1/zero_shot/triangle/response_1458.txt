Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 1, 7>
<4, 2, 7>
<7, 1, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [8].
