Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
