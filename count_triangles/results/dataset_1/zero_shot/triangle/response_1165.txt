Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of closed triads. A closed triad represents a triangle in the graph. 

In this given graph, let's count the number of triangles:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.

Now, let's list the triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
