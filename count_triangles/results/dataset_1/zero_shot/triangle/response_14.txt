Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
