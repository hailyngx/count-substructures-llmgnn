Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 5>
<4, 9, 0>
<4, 9, 1>
<9, 8, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the graph.
