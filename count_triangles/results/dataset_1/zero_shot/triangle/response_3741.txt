Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <7, 8, 4>.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The final answer is [5].
