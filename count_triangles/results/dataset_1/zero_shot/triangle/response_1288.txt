Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's calculate the total number of triangles present in the given graph.

First, let's list out the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <0, 6, 7>
5. <0, 6, 9>
6. <0, 7, 9>
7. <1, 4, 6>
8. <1, 4, 7>
9. <1, 5, 7>
10. <1, 5, 8>
11. <2, 3, 5>
12. <2, 3, 7>
13. <4, 5, 6>
14. <5, 6, 7>

There are a total of 14 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [14].
