Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
