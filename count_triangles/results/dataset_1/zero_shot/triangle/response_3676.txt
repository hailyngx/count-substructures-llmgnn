Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, 3, 6> and <1, 2, 6> triangles in this graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
