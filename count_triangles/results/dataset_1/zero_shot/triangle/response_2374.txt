Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
0 -- 2 -- 6           1 -- 8
|    |    | \         |    |
5    9    3  4        7    |
|               \           |
7                8         3 
```

To count the number of triangles, we can check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle. The nodes that form a triangle in this graph are: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 0, 9>, <7, 0, 9>.

Counting the total number of unique triangles in this graph, we find that there are 12 triangles in total. Therefore, the output will be [12].
