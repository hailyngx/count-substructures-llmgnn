Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 8, 5>
<3, 6, 4>
<3, 9, 2>
<4, 6, 2>
<4, 7, 5>
<5, 8, 2>
<5, 7, 1>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
