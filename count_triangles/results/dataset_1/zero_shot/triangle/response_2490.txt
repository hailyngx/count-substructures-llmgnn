Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(d_i-1)(d_i-2) \]

where \(d_i\) represents the degree of node \(i\) in the graph.

Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

For each node:
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 6
- Node 10 is not connected to any other node, so its degree is 0

Now, we can plug these degrees into the formula:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} [4*3*2 + 4*3*2 + 3*2*1 + 3*2*1 + 1*0*0 + 5*4*3 + 4*3*2 + 5*4*3 + 6*5*4] \]

Calculating this gives us 72 triangles in total.

Now, let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:

<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [72].
