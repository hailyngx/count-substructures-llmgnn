Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph:
[<1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 9>]
Therefore, the answer is [13].
