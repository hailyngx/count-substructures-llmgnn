Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 8, 6>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<7, 4, 0>
<7, 8, 6>

There are a total of 10 triangles in the graph.
