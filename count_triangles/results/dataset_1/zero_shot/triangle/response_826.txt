Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node can form and then dividing by 6. Let's count the number of triangles:

Node 0: 0 triangles
Node 1: 4 triangles <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>
Node 2: 1 triangle <1, 2, 5>
Node 3: 0 triangles
Node 4: 2 triangles <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>
Node 5: 1 triangle <3, 5, 6>
Node 6: 2 triangles <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 7>
Node 7: 3 triangles <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>
Node 8: 1 triangle <2, 4, 8>
Node 9: 0 triangles

Adding the number of triangles from each node, we get a total of 14 triangles. Dividing this by 6, we find that there are [<2>] triangles in total in the given graph.
