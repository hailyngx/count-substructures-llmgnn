Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for cycles of length three. 

After analyzing the provided edges, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
1. <2, 4, 7>
2. <2, 4, 8>
3. <2, 6, 8>

There are a total of 3 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
