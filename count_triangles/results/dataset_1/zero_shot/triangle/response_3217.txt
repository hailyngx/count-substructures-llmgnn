Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <1, 7, 9>
5. <2, 5, 9>
6. <4, 5, 9>
7. <6, 0, 7>
8. <7, 8, 9>
9. <8, 3, 9>  
    
Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [9].
