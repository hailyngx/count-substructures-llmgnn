Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is [6].

The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 5, 9>.
