Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding how many paths exist of length 2 between each pair of nodes. In graph theory, a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected such that each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 44 edges, let's find the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle 3: <0, 8, 9>
- Triangle 4: <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 6: <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle 7: <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle 8: <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle 9: <4, 5, 8>
- Triangle 10: <5, 7, 9>
- Triangle 11: <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph. The answer is [11].
