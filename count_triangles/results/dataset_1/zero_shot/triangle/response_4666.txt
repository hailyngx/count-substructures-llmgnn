Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is [6], and the unique triangles found are <0, 7, 5>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 4>, and <6, 7, 8>.
