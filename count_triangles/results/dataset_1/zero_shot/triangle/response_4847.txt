Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 1, 9>, <3, 8, 4>, <5, 4, 8>, <7, 2, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
