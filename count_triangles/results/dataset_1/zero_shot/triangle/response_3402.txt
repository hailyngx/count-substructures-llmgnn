Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
