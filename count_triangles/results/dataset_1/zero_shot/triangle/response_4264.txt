Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<4, 8, 9>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
