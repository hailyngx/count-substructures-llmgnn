Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows: 

<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
