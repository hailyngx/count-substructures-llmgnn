Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 9, 6>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
