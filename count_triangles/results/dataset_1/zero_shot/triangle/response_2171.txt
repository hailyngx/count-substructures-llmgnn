Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles present in a graph can be calculated using the formula: \( \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(d_i-1)(d_i-2) \), where \(d_i\) is the degree of node i. 

In this given graph, the degrees of each node are as follows:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 1
Node 3: degree 7
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 2

Plugging these values into the formula, we get the total number of triangles in this graph: 
\( \frac{1}{6} \left[3*2*1 + 2*1*0 + 1*0*0 + 7*6*5 + 2*1*0 + 3*2*1 + 3*2*1 + 4*3*2 + 4*3*2 + 2*1*0\right] = 35 \)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [35]. The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>.
