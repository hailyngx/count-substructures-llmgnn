Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated using the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. Let's first list down the unique triangles present in the graph:

<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 9>

Counting the unique triangles we found, we see that there are a total of 16 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
