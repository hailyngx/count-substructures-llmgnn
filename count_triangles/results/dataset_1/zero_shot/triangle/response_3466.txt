Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 0, 8>
<6, 2, 7>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
