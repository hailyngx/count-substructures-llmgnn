Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <7, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
