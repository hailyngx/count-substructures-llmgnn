Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 8 triangles. Here is the list of unique triangles:
[<0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 8, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 7, 6>, <7, 8, 9>]
