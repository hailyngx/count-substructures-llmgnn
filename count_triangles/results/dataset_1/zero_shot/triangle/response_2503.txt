Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, and <4, 6, 9>.
