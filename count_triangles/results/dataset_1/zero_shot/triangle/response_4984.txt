Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes.

Looking at the graph:

- Possible triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>
- Possible triangles involving node 1: <1, 5, 6>
- Possible triangles involving node 4: <4, 5, 6>
- Possible triangles involving node 5: <5, 6, 1>

Counting these unique triangles, we get a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
