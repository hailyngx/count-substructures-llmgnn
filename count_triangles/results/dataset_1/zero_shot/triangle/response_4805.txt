Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 9, 0>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 8>
<1, 6, 5>
<3, 1, 8>
<7, 4, 8>
<7, 8, 5>

There are a total of 10 unique triangles in the graph. 
Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
