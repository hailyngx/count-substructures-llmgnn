Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
From the given graph, the triangles can be formed by finding sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
6. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
7. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
8. Triangle <3, 2, 7>
9. Triangle <3, 7, 8>

Count of Triangles: [9]
