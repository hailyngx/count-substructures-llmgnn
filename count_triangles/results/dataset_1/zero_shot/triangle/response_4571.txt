Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in this graph.  

The triangles are:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the answer is [5].
