Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph.  

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 9>

Therefore, the answer is [3].
