Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:

<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 3>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
