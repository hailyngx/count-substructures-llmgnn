Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by 3 nodes out of the 10 nodes in the graph.

After analyzing the graph, the triangles present in the graph are as follows:
<4, 2, 6> <6, 8, 2> <6, 8, 7> <6, 9, 7> <9, 4, 2> <9, 4, 5> <9, 4, 6> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
