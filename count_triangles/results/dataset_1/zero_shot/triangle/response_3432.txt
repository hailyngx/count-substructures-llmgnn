Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has 6 triangles. Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 8, 2>
<2, 8, 0>
<2, 9, 3>
<3, 6, 9>
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
