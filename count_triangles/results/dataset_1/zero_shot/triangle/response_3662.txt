Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <1, 4, 5>
5. <3, 4, 7>
6. <3, 4, 8>
7. <4, 5, 7>
8. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the provided graph. 
The final answer is [8].
