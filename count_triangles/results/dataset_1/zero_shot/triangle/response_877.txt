Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles are: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <0, 5, 8>.
