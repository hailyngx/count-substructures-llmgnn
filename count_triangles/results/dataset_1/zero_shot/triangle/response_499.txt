Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
