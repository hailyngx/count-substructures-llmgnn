Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
    1 --- 3
     \     |
       \   | 
         \ |
    0 --- 2 --- 9
         /|
       /  |
     /    |
    4 --- 5
         \  
          \
            \ 
              6
```

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

We can see that the triangles present in this graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<4, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
