Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 5, 1>, <0, 9, 1>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 9, 2>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 9, 2>, <1, 8, 4>, <1, 9, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 9, 7>, <3, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
