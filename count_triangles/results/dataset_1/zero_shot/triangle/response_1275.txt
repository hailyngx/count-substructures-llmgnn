Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, and <3, 8, 6>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
