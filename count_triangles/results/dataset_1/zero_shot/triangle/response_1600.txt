Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <2, 1, 3>, <2, 3, 9>, <9, 4, 7> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
