Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be counted by examining all possible triangles that can be formed using the given edges. 

After analyzing the given graph, here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <2, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total.
The final answer is [10].
