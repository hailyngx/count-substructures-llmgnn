Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<6, 1, 2>
<6, 1, 8>
<6, 2, 8>
<9, 3, 5>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
