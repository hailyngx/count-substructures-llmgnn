Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 4>
<7, 1, 8>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
