Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of paths of length 2 between all possible node pairs. To simplify this process, we can utilize the given graph and list out the unique triangles present:

1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <1, 2, 8>
4. <1, 4, 7>
5. <1, 4, 8>
6. <1, 7, 8>
7. <2, 4, 7>
8. <2, 4, 8>
9. <3, 5, 8>
10. <3, 5, 9>
11. <3, 7, 9>
12. <4, 7, 9>
13. <5, 8, 9>

Counting all unique triangles in the given graph, we find a total of 13 triangles. Therefore, the final answer is [13].
