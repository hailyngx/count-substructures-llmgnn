Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <3, 6, 7>.
