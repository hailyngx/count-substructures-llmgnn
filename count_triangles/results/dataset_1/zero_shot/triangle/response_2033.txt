Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<1, 8, 5>
<1, 9, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<7, 3, 2>
<7, 9, 1>
<9, 4, 2>
<9, 7, 1>

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the graph.
