Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 1>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 1, 5>
<4, 2, 5>
<4, 3, 5>
<6, 2, 4>

There are 9 triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
