Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 3>, <5, 3, 9>, <0, 7, 6>, <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
