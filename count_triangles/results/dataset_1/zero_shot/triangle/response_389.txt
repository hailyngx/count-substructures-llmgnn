Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node participates in and dividing the sum by 3, as each triangle involves 3 nodes. Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

Node 0 participates in 0 triangles
Node 1 participates in 2 triangles <1, 3, 5> and <1, 4, 5>
Node 2 participates in 0 triangles
Node 3 participates in 2 triangles <3, 4, 5> and <3, 4, 9>
Node 4 participates in 12 triangles <3, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 2>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <6, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 0, 7>, and <4, 1, 2>
Node 5 participates in 6 triangles <5, 4, 3>, <1, 5, 3>, <5, 4, 9>, <6, 5, 4>, <5, 1, 4>, and <5, 9, 4>
Node 6 participates in 0 triangles
Node 7 participates in 0 triangles
Node 8 participates in 0 triangles
Node 9 participates in 1 triangle <3, 4, 9>

Adding up all the triangles, we get a total of 23 triangles. Therefore, the final answer is [23].
