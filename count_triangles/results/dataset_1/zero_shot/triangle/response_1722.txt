Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph mentioned has 10 nodes and 30 edges. To find the number of triangles, we need to identify the sets of three nodes that form triangles.

There are a total of <11> triangles in the given graph: 

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
