Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the graph. 
So, the final answer is [9].
