Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:

<0, 5, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
