Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of closed loops of length 3. 

Upon examining the given graph, we can see that there are 8 triangles present. 

The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 6, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 0, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 4>, <3, 7, 4>, and <4, 9, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
