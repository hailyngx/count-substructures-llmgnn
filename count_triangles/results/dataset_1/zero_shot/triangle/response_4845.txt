Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 11 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:

<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 7>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 4>
<3, 8, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 9, 7>
<8, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
