Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually adjacent to each other.

We can see that the triangles in this graph are:
<3, 4, 7>  
<3, 5, 8>  

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
