Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The unique triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
