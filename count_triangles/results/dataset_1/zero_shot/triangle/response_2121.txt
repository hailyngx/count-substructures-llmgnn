Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can form the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
