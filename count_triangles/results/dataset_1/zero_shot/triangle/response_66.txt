Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph forms 14 triangles. The triangles are:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 1>
<6, 0, 5>
<7, 4, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 5>
<8, 2, 6>
<8, 6, 0>
<8, 7, 4>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
