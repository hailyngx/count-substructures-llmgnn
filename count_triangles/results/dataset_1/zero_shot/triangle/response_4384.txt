Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 5.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the answer is [5].
