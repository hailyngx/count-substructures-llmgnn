Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 -- 1 -- 5 -- 4 -- 2 -- 8
|         |         |
6         4         |
|                   |
8 ------- 2 ------- 3
|
9 -- 7
```

To count the number of triangles, we need to identify the unique triangles in the graph. The triangles present in this graph are:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 5, 4>
- <0, 5, 1>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <1, 5, 4>
- <2, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 6. 
Thus, the final answer is [6].
