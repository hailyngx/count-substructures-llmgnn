Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by looking at the triangles formed by each triplet of nodes. Since each triangle consists of 3 nodes and each triangle has 3 edges, we need to check if there are any triangles in the graph.

Calculating the triangles in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 9: <0, 7, 9>
- Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 6: <1, 2, 6>
- Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 6: <1, 3, 6>
- Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 5: <2, 1, 5>
- Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 6: <5, 2, 6>
- Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 9: <5, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [5]
