Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula: 

\[ \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(d_i-1)(d_i-2) \]

where \(d_i\) represents the degree of node \(i\).

Let's calculate:

degree of node 0 = 3  
degree of node 1 = 3  
degree of node 2 = 2  
degree of node 3 = 2  
degree of node 4 = 2  
degree of node 5 = 6  
degree of node 6 = 2  
degree of node 7 = 4  
degree of node 8 = 4  
degree of node 9 = 2  

Plugging in these values into the formula:

\[ \frac{1}{6} [3(2)(1) + 3(2)(1) + 2(1)(0) + 2(1)(0) + 2(1)(0) + 6(5)(4) + 2(1)(0) + 4(3)(2) + 4(3)(2) + 2(1)(0)] = \frac{1}{6} * 142 = 23\]

Therefore, there are 23 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:  
<0, 1, 5>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<1, 5, 8>  
<2, 6, 5>  
<2, 7, 4>  
<2, 7, 9>  
<4, 5, 7>  
<5, 7, 9>  
<7, 8, 3>  
<8, 3, 5>  

Thus, the final answer is: [23].
