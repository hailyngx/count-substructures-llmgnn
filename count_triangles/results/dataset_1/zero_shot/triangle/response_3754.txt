Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 1, 3>
<2, 1, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
