Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 6>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of 7 triangles in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
