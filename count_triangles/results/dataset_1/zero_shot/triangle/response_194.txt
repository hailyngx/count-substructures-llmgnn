Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 8.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 4>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
