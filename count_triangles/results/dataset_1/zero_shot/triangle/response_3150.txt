Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be illustrated as follows:

```
  0 --- 1 --- 5 --- 8
  |     |     |     |
  4 --- 2     6     7
          \   |   /
            \ | /
              3  
              |
              9
```

To count the number of triangles, we need to find all sets of 3 nodes that are mutually connected. We can identify the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <1, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 2, which can be denoted by [2].
