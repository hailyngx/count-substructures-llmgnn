Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 7, 2>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 7, 6>
<6, 7, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
