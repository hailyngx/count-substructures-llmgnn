Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<3, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 7>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
