Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <8, 7, 9>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
