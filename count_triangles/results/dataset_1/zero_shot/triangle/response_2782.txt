Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
