Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<0, 1, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 7, 5>
<2, 6, 1>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 2>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 4>
<7, 8, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 unique triangles in this graph. Hence, the final answer is [10].
