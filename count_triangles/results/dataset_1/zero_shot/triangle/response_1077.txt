Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <2, 5, 7>
There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
