Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [24] triangles in the given graph. Here are some of the unique triangles found: <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 0, 9>, <2, 9, 6>, <2, 9, 7>, <4, 3, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 7>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 9, 2>, <7, 1, 6>, <7, 1, 9>, <7, 5, 9>, <7, 8, 4>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 4, 7>, <9, 0, 2>, <9, 0, 6>, <9, 0, 7>, <9, 2, 0>, <9, 2, 6>.
