Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be visually represented as follows:

\[ \begin{array}{ccccccccc}
&  &  & 8 & - & 5 \\
&  & / & | &  & | \\
7 & - & 0 & - & 2 & - & 6 \\
&  & | &  & | &  & | \\
&  &  & 1 & - & 3 &  & 4 \\
\end{array} \]

There are total of 10 unique triangles in this graph:  
\[ \{0, 7, 1\}, \{0, 7, 4\}, \{0, 5, 2\}, \{0, 5, 8\}, \{0, 7, 6\}, \{1, 7, 4\}, \{1, 3, 4\}, \{2, 0, 5\}, \{5, 6, 7\}, \{5, 8, 0\} \]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
