Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: <0, 2, 3>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
