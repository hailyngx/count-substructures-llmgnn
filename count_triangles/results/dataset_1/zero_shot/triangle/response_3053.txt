Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by checking for each triplet of nodes if there exists an edge connecting all three nodes. Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

By examining the graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10]. The unique triangles are listed above.
