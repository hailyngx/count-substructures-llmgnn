Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
        1
        |
        7
       / \
      4 - 6 - 8
      | / | /
      2 - 7
      | /
      5 - 9
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected by edges. 

After examining the graph, we can see that there are five triangles in total. Let's list them:

1. Triangle 1: <2, 4, 7>
2. Triangle 2: <2, 6, 8>
3. Triangle 3: <3, 5, 9>
4. Triangle 4: <4, 6, 7>
5. Triangle 5: <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [5].
