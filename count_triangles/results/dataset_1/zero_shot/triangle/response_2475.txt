Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 9>.
