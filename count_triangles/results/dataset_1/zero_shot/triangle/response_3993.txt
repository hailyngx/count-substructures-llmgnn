Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<2, 4, 5>
<2, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the graph.
