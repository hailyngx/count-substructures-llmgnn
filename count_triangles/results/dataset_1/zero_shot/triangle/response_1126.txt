Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
