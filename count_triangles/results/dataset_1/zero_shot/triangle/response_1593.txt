Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 4>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 6.  

So, the final answer is [6].
