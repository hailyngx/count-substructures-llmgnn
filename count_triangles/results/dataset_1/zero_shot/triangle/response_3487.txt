Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles found:
[<0, 1, 2>, <2, 6, 7>, <6, 5, 7>, <7, 8, 9>, <0, 2, 6>, <6, 7, 8>]  
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
