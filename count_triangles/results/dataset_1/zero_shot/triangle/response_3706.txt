Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are total of [15] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 0, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 1, 9>, <8, 3, 7>.
