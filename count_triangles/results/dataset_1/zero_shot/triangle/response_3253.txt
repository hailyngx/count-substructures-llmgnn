Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:

[<0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 1>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
