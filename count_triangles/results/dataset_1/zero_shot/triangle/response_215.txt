Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be counted based on the number of nodes and edges in the given graph. 

By using the formula for counting triangles in a graph: 
Number of triangles = (1/6) * Î£(d_i)*(d_i-1)*(d_i-2)

Where d_i represents the degree of node i.

Let's calculate the number of triangles. 
First, let's find the degree of each node:

Node 0: degree = 4
Node 1: degree = 3
Node 2: degree = 1
Node 3: degree = 3
Node 4: degree = 3
Node 5: degree = 1
Node 6: degree = 4
Node 7: degree = 2
Node 8: degree = 1
Node 9: degree = 2

Now, substituting the values into the formula, we get:
Number of triangles = (1/6) * [4*3*2 + 3*2*1 + 1*0*(-1) + 3*2*1 + 3*2*1 + 1*0*(-1) + 4*3*2 + 2*1*0 + 1*0*(-1) + 2*1*0]
                    = (1/6) * [24 + 6 + 0 + 6 + 6 + 0 + 24 + 0 + 0 + 0]
                    = (1/6) * 66
                    = 11

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.

Listing the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 7, 5>
<1, 3, 2>
<3, 8, 2>
<4, 9, 4>
<5, 7, 0>
<6, 1, 4>
<6, 4, 0>
<6, 4, 1>
<6, 0, 7>

So, the final answer is [11].
