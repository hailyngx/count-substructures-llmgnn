Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes.

[12]

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<2, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<0, 6, 3>
<0, 9, 4>
<1, 2, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
