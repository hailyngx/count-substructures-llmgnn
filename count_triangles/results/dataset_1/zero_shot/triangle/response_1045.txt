Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 14 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 3>, <8, 3, 1>]
