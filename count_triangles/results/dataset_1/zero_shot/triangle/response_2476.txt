Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>]
