Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 9, 6>
<5, 9, 6>

There are a total of 9 unique triangles. Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
