Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, the triangles formed are as follows:

1. <1, 3, 8>
2. <1, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
