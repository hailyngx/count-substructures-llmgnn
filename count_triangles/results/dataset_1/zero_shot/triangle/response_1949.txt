Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of paths of length 2 between every pair of vertices. In this graph, we have 10 vertices. Let's count the triangles.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
