Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 6>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 1, 2>
<6, 7, 2>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 3, 1>
<9, 8, 2>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
