Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles can be calculated by counting each unique triangle in the graph. Let's go ahead and find the number of triangles in this graph.

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 5>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [7].
