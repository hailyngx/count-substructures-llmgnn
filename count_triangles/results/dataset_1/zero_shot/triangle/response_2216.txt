Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 7>. 
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
