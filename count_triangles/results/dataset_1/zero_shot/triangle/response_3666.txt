Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:

<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
