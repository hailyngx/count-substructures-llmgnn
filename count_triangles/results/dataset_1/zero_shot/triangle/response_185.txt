Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 2>
<2, 5, 4>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 9, 0>
