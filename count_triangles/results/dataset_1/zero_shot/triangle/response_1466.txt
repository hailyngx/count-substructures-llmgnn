Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are <2, 1, 4>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 3, 4>, and <4, 5, 8>.
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
