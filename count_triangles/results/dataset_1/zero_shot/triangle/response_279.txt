Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is [18]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>.
