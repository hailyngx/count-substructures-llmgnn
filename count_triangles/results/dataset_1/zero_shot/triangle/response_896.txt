Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 16.

The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 0, 8>
<5, 1, 7>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 0, 8>
<7, 1, 5>
<7, 2, 3>
<8, 4, 0>

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
