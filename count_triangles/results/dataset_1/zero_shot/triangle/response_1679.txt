Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected with edges between each pair of nodes.

By examining the given edges, we can see that the triangles in the graph are formed by the following node triplets:
1. <2, 5, 4>
2. <7, 6, 5>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
