Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 9, 8>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 8, 4>
<8, 9, 3>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
