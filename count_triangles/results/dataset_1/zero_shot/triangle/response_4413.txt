Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by 3 nodes that are connected to each other. Let's find all the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - <0, 2, 5>

2. Triangles involving node 1:
   (No triangles with node 1)

3. Triangles involving node 2:
   - <0, 2, 5>

4. Triangles involving node 3:
   (No triangles with node 3)

5. Triangles involving node 4:
   (No triangles with node 4)

6. Triangles involving node 5:
   - <0, 2, 5>

7. Triangles involving node 6:
   (No triangles with node 6)

8. Triangles involving node 7:
   (No triangles with node 7)

9. Triangles involving node 8:
   (No triangles with node 8)

10. Triangles involving node 9:
   (No triangles with node 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1]. The unique triangle found is <0, 2, 5>.
