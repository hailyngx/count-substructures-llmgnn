Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<7, 4, 8>
<0, 9, 3>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
