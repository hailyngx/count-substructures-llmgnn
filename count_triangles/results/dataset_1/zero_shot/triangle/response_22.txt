Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

[<1, 5, 6> <1, 5, 2> <1, 2, 6> <5, 2, 6> <7, 6, 5> <7, 5, 1> <7, 5, 6>]

There are a total of 7 triangles in the graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [7].
