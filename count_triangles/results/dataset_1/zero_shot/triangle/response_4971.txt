Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 7, 6>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 4, 8>
<7, 5, 7>
<7, 5, 9>
<7, 6, 0>
<7, 6, 9>
<7, 0, 6>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 0, 6>
<7, 3, 9>
<8, 1, 2>
<8, 1, 4>
<8, 2, 1>
<8, 4, 1>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 4, 9>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 4, 9>
<9, 0, 7>
<9, 0, 3>
<9, 0, 7>
<9, 0, 3>
<9, 0, 7>
<9, 0, 3>
<9, 3, 7>
<9, 7, 0>
<9, 7, 3>
<9, 7, 0>
<9, 7, 3>
<9, 7, 0>
<9, 7, 3>
<9, 7, 8>

There are a total of 37 triangles in the given graph. So the final answer is [37].
