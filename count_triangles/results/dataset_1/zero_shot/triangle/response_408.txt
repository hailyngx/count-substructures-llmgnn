Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
