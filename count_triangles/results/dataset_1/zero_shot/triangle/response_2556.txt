Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [22].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<4, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>

Therefore, the final answer is [22].
