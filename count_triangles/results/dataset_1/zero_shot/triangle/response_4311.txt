Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph given has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
