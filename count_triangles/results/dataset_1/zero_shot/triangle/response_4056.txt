Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

[<0, 9, 5>, <0, 9, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <9, 5, 8>]
