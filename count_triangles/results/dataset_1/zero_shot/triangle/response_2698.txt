Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 --- 5 --- 7 --- 9
    |     |   |   |   |
    |     |   |   |   |
    4 --- 2   6   8   1
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will look for cycles of length 3 that close to form triangles.

There are 4 unique triangles in this graph: <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <5, 7, 9>, and <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
