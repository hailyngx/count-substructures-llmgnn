Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 9>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
