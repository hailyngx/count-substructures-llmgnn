Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 0>, <8, 9, 6>.
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
