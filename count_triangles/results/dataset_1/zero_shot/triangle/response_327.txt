Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 6, 7>  
<0, 7, 9>  
<1, 3, 7>  
<2, 7, 8>  
<6, 7, 9>  
<7, 8, 9>
