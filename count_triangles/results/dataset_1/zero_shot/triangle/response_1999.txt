Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the given graph, and they are: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 9, 8>, <8, 9, 6>.
