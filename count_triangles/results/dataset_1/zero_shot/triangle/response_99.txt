Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 0, 2>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
