Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes from the graph that form a triangle. Since a triangle requires 3 edges between 3 nodes, we need to find all sets of 3 nodes where the edges between them form a closed loop.

Given the graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <2, 4, 8>
3. <2, 4, 9>
4. <3, 6, 9>
5. <4, 5, 6>
6. <4, 5, 7>
7. <4, 6, 7>
8. <4, 8, 9>
9. <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are 9 unique triangles in the graph. [9]
