Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 0>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 6, 3>.  
There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
