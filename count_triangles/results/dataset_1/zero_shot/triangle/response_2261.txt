Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [12] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 5, 7>, <8, 5, 9>, <8, 2, 3>, <8, 3, 5>.
