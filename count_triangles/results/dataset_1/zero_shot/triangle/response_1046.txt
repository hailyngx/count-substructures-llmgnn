Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. 

After examining the given graph, the unique triangles are:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
