Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The unique triangles found in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<3, 1, 5>
<7, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
