Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found using the formula \[ \text{Total Triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=0}^{n} \text{degree}(v_i) \times (\text{degree}(v_i) - 1) \times (\text{degree}(v_i) - 2) \]
where n = total number of nodes and degree(vi) is the degree of node i.

Given the degrees of the nodes in the graph:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 2

Therefore, plugging in these values into the formula, we get:
\[ \text{Total Triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \left( 3 \times 2 \times 1 + 2 \times 1 \times 0 + 4 \times 3 \times 2 + 2 \times 1 \times 0 + 4 \times 3 \times 2 + 3 \times 2 \times 1 + 5 \times 4 \times 3 + 4 \times 3 \times 2 + 3 \times 2 \times 1 + 2 \times 1 \times 0 \right) \]
\[ \text{Total Triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \left( 6 + 0 + 24 + 0 + 24 + 6 + 60 + 24 + 6 + 0 \right) = 40\]

Therefore, there are 40 triangles in the given graph.

List of unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is: [40].
