Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 8, 2>
<1, 4, 3>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 8, 7>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 1>
<5, 0, 8>
<5, 1, 4>
<5, 1, 9>
<5, 6, 0>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 6>
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 9, 3>
<6, 0, 8>
<6, 2, 8>
<6, 2, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 5, 1>
<7, 5, 9>
<7, 6, 2>
<7, 8, 0>
<7, 8, 2>
<8, 0, 5>
<8, 0, 6>
<8, 2, 6>
<8, 7, 5>
<8, 7, 6>
<9, 2, 8>
<9, 2, 5>
<9, 3, 4>
<9, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [34].
