Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>.
