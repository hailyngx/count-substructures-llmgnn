Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The unique triangles in this graph are <1, 2, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, and <5, 6, 8>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
