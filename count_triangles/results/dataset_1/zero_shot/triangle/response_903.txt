Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<2, 1, 7>
<2, 9, 4>
<2, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
