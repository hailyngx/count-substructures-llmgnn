Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 2>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 5>. 

Therefore, the answer is [10].
