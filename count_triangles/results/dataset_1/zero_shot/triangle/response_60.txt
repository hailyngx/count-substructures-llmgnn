Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles based on the given edges. 

Count of triangles [10]:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
