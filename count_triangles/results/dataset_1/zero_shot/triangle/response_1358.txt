Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph forms the following triangles:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 7, 9>

There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph.    
Therefore, the final answer is [7].
