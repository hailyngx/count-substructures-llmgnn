Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
[<0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <7, 4, 1>]
There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
