Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all the combinations of 3 nodes that are connected by edges. 

After going through all the possible combinations, we find the following triangles:

<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 9, and the answer is [9].
