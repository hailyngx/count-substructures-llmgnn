Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
