Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
