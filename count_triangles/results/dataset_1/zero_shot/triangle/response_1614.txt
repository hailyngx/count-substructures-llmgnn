Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 1, 4>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
