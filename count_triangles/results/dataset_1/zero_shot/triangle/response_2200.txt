Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
