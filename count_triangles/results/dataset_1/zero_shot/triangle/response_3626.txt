Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are total of [16] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 0, 2>, <7, 0, 9>, <7, 2, 9>, <8, 5, 6>, <8, 5, 9>, <8, 6, 9>, <9, 6, 7>, <9, 6, 8>, <9, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 4>. Thus, the final answer is [16].
