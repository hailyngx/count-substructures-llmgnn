Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are connected in a triangular manner.

Starting from node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.

Moving to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.

Analyzing other nodes in a similar manner:
- Node 2 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 has connections with nodes 1, 5, 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 9.
- Node 6 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 9 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's list the triangles found in the graph:
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<6, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles, we have found 4 unique triangles in the graph: <2, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <6, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
