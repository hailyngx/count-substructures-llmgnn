Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 0, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<5, 1, 9>
<5, 1, 6>
<5, 9, 6>
<6, 5, 9>
<6, 5, 1>
<6, 7, 0>
<7, 0, 2>
<7, 6, 5>
<8, 3, 2>
<9, 1, 5>
<9, 1, 6>
<9, 5, 6>

There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [16].
