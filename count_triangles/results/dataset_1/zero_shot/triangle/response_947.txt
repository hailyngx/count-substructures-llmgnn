Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<0, 1, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of 10 unique triangles in the graph. Hence, the final answer is [10].
