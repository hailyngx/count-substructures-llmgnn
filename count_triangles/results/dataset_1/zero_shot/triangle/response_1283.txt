Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 9, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<8, 6, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
