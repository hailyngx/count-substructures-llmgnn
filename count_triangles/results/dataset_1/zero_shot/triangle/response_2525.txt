Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{v \in V} d(v) (d(v)-1) (d(v)-2) \]

where \( V \) is the set of vertices and \( d(v) \) represents the degree of vertex \( v \).

Calculating this for the given graph:
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} ((4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2) + (4 \cdot 3 \cdot 3) + (4 \cdot 3 \cdot 3) + (3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1) + (3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3) + (3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3) + (4 \cdot 3 \cdot 1) + (3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2) + (3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3) + (2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0)) = \frac{160}{6} = 26.67 \]

However, since each triangle is counted three times in the formula above (once for each vertex), we need to divide by 3 to get the correct number of triangles.

Therefore, there are 26 triangles in the given graph.

Let's list the unique triangles:
\[ 
\text{<0, 1, 5>}, \text{<0, 1, 8>}, \text{<0, 6, 7>}, \text{<0, 6, 8>}, \text{<1, 3, 5>}, \text{<1, 3, 8>}, \text{<2, 3, 7>}, \text{<4, 8, 9>}
\]

The final answer is: [26].
