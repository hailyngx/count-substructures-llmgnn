Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of cycles of length 3 in the graph. 

The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<8, 2, 5>
<8, 2, 9>

Counting each unique triangle, we have a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
