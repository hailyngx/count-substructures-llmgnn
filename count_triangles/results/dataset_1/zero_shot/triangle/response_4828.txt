Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

[<0, 1, 2>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 6>]   [4]
