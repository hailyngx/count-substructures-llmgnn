Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 4 ,6>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, and <5, 6, 8>.
