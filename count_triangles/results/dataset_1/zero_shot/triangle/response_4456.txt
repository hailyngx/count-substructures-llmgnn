Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
