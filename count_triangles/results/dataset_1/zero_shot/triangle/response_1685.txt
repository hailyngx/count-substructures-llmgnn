Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique paths of length 2 between nodes. Let's find the triangles in this graph:

<0, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 0, 4>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 1, 5>
<4, 2, 7>
<5, 1, 4>
<5, 4, 8>
<6, 0, 1>
<6, 0, 4>
<7, 2, 4>
<7, 2, 8>
<8, 5, 4>
<8, 5, 7>

Counting these unique triangles gives us: [17]
