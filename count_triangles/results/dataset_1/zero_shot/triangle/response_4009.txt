Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 9, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 1, 4>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in total. [5]
