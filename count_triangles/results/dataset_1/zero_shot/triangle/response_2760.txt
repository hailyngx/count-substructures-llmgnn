Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: 
<0, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
