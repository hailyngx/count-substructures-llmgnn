Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique paths of length 2 (triangles) between three distinct nodes. 

Upon examining the edges provided, the triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 0, 3>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 0, 8>, <2, 0, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 0, 4>, <3, 1, 4>, <3, 2, 4>, <4, 1, 6>, <4, 2, 8>, <4, 2, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <7, 0, 9>, <8, 2, 9>, <8, 4, 9>, <9, 0, 7>.

Therefore, the answer is [28].
