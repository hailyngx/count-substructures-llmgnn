Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

    0 -- 2 -- 4
    |    |    |
    1    5    |
         |    |
         8 -- 7
              |
              9
              |
              3
              |
              6

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

There are 4 triangles present in this graph:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <2, 5, 8>
4. <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
