Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated as follows:  
  
Number of triangles = 1/6 * (sum of [(degree of each node)^2 - number of edges connected to the node])  
  
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

Number of triangles = 1/6 * [(4^2 - 5) + (3^2 - 3) + (5^2 - 3) + (4^2 - 3) + (3^2 - 2) + (5^2 - 5) + (4^2 - 3) + (4^2 - 4) + (3^2 - 2) + (4^2 - 4)]  
Number of triangles = 1/6 * [16 + 6 + 22 + 13 + 7 + 20 + 13 + 12 + 7 + 12]  
Number of triangles = 1/6 * 128  
Number of triangles = 21  

Therefore, there are a total of 21 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <8, 5, 4>

So, the final answer is [21].
