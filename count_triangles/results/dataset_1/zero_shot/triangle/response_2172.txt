Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes in the graph.

Here are the unique triangles in the given graph:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
[2]
