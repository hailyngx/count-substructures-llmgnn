Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets []:

[<0, 4, 7> <0, 7, 9> <0, 9, 1> <1, 2, 5> <1, 9, 7> <2, 3, 6> <2, 3, 9>]
