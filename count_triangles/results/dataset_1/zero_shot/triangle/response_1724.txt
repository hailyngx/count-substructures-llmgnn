Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by summing up the contributions from each triangle each node is a part of. Let's calculate the number of triangles:

Node 0 is a part of 2 triangles: <0, 3, 7> and <0, 7, 4>.
Node 1 is a part of 1 triangle: <1, 4, 5>.
Node 2 is a part of 1 triangle: <2, 3, 4>.
Node 3 is a part of 4 triangles: <0, 3, 2>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 7>.
Node 4 is a part of 3 triangles: <1, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 7>.
Node 5 is a part of 4 triangles: <1, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>.
Node 6 is a part of 2 triangles: <5, 6, 7> and <6, 7, 9>.
Node 7 is a part of 4 triangles: <0, 7, 4>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 9>.
Node 8 is a part of 1 triangle: <1, 5, 8>.
Node 9 is a part of 1 triangle: <6, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 20.

So, the answer is [20] with the unique triangles being: <0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>.
