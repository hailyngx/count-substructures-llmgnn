Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<2, 0, 8>
<2, 0, 5>
<2, 0, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 5, 4>
<3, 6, 4>
<5, 4, 6>
<1, 7, 9>
<5, 9, 1>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
