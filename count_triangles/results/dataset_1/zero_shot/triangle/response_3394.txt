Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <9, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
