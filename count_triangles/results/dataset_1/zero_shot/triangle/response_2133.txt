Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 6, 2>, <6, 1, 4>.
