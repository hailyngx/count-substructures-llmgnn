Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 2>
<6, 7, 1>
<6, 7, 0>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 3>
<5, 8, 3>

Therefore, there are 10 unique triangles in total. So, the final answer is [10].
