Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 7>
<6, 5, 0>
<6, 5, 3>
<6, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 7, 3>
<6, 7, 5>
<7, 4, 3>
<8, 3, 4>
<9, 1, 6>
<9, 1, 8>

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [14].
