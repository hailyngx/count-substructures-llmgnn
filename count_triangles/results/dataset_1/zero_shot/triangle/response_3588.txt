Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<4, 7, 9>

Hence, there are [5] triangles in the graph.
