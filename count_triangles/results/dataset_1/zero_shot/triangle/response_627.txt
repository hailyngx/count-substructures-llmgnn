Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
[<1, 0, 4> <1, 7, 9> <1, 5, 6> <1, 9, 7> <1, 7, 6> <1, 7, 4> <1, 0, 4> <4, 7, 9> <4, 2, 8> <4, 7, 6> <4, 7, 1> <7, 9, 1>] 
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
