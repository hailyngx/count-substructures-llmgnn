Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining all possible triangles formed by three nodes connected by edges. 

There are [28] unique triangles in the graph as follows:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 1>
<2, 8, 6>
<2, 8, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 2>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 7, 6>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 1, 8>
<4, 3, 6>
<4, 3, 9>
<4, 9, 0>
<5, 2, 7>
<5, 2, 9>
<5, 7, 6>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [28].
