Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is involved in and then dividing by 3 (since each triangle involves 3 nodes).

Upon analyzing the given graph, we find the following triangles:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<8, 9, 3>

Counting the number of triangles:
1 triangle involving node 0
2 triangles involving node 1
1 triangle involving node 2
1 triangle involving node 3
1 triangle involving node 4
0 triangles involving node 5
1 triangle involving node 6
1 triangle involving node 7
1 triangle involving node 8
2 triangles involving node 9

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 triangles. Therefore, the final answer inside brackets is [10].
