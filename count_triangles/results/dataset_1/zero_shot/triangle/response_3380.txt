Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by each possible combination of three nodes.

After checking all possible combinations, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 1>
<6, 8, 9>

There are 10 unique triangles in total in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
