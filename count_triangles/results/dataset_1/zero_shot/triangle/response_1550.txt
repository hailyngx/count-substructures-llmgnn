Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all unique combinations of 3 nodes that are connected by edges. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

[<2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 1>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 9, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 9, 6>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
