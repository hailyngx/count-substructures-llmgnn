Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 -- 4          8
    |    |         /
    5 -- 3 -- 7 -- 0
          |       |
          6 -- 9 -- 
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, each triangle can be represented as a set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 3, 6>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 3, 7>
3. Triangle 3: <1, 4, 5>

So, there are 3 triangles in total. Therefore, the answer is [3].
