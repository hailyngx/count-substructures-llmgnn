Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
      
            0 -- 1 -- 9
            |    |    |
            2 -- 4    3
             \  |  / |
               5 -- 8
                  |
                  6
                  |
                  7

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

Number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
