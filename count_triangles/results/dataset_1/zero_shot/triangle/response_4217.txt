Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
