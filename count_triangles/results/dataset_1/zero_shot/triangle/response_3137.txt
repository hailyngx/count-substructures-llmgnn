Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting all possible triangles that can be formed using the nodes connected by edges. 

In this graph, some of the triangles include:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 8, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 8>

There are in total [7] triangles in the given graph.
