Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 1, 8>, <3, 2, 4>, <3, 2, 5>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 2, 5>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 2, 9>, <7, 0, 8>, <7, 4, 9>, <8, 0, 1>, <8, 0, 3>, <8, 0, 7>, <8, 1, 3>, <8, 1, 9>, <8, 3, 9>, <8, 7, 9>, <9, 4, 5>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 5, 2>, <9, 8, 7>

Count of triangles: [29]
