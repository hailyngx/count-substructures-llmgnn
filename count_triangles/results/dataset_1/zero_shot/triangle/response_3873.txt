Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the graph are as follows:

<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
