Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by examining all possible triangles that can be formed by connecting three vertices. Since counting each triangle individually would be time-consuming, we can use the formula for counting triangles in a graph based on the number of triangles that share a common edge.

Given the total number of nodes (10 nodes) and the total number of edges (32 edges), we can calculate the total number of triangles as follows:

Total number of triangles = 1/6 * (Sum of (degree of each vertex)^2)

Calculating the degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 0: degree = 3 (connected to 1, 2, 7)
- Vertex 1: degree = 4 (connected to 0, 2, 5, 6)
- Vertex 2: degree = 5 (connected to 0, 1, 6, 7, 8)
- Vertex 3: degree = 2 (connected to 5)
- Vertex 4: degree = 2 (connected to 6, 7)
- Vertex 5: degree = 3 (connected to 1, 3, 7)
- Vertex 6: degree = 4 (connected to 1, 2, 4, 9)
- Vertex 7: degree = 5 (connected to 0, 2, 4, 5, 9)
- Vertex 8: degree = 2 (connected to 2, 9)
- Vertex 9: degree = 3 (connected to 6, 7, 8)

Summing the squares of the degrees:
(3^2) + (4^2) + (5^2) + (2^2) + (2^2) + (3^2) + (4^2) + (5^2) + (2^2) + (3^2) = 142

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = 1/6 * 142 = 23

Hence, there are 23 triangles in the given graph. Let's find these triangles below:

[<0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 1, 0>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 1, 0>, <6, 1, 2>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 2, 0>, <6, 2, 1>, <7, 0, 1>, <7, 0, 2>, <7, 0, 4>] 

Therefore, the answer is [23].
