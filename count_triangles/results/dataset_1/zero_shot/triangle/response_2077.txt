Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 3.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 8>

Therefore, the answer is [3].
