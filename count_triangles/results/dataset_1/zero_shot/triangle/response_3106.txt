Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the graph are:

<1, 5, 2>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
