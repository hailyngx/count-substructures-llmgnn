Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 0, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<7, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
