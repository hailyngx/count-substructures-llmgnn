Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 1, 4>
<3, 1, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 4>
<2, 9, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
