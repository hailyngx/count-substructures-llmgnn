Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. Let's find the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 3, 5>
4. Triangle 4: <0, 4, 5>
5. Triangle 5: <0, 5, 8>
6. Triangle 6: <2, 5, 3>
7. Triangle 7: <5, 6, 8>
8. Triangle 8: <6, 8, 0>
9. Triangle 9: <6, 8, 5>

So, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. The answer is [9].
