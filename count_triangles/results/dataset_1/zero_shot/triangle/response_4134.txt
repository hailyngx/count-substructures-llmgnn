Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The list of unique triangles in the given graph are: 
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9> 

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is: [10]
