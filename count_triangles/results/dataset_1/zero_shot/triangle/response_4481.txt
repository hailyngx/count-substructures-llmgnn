Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [8].
