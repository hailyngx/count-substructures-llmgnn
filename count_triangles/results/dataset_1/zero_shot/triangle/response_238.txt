Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node participates in and summing them up. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The nodes and their connections can be represented as follows:
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [0, 5, 6, 9]
- Node 2: [3, 4]
- Node 3: [2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]
- Node 4: [2, 3, 9]
- Node 5: [1, 3, 7, 8]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [3, 5, 9]
- Node 8: [3, 5]
- Node 9: [1, 3, 4, 7]

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Node 0 does not form any triangle.
- Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 5-3-7, 5-3-8, and 7-3-9.
- Node 2 does not form any triangle.
- Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 5-7-9 and 5-8-9.
- Node 4 does not form any triangle.
- Node 5 does not form any triangle.
- Node 6 does not form any triangle.
- Node 7 does not form any triangle.
- Node 8 does not form any triangle.
- Node 9 forms a triangle with nodes 1-3-7.

Hence, there are 5 triangles in the given graph: <5, 3, 7>, <5, 3, 8>, <7, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, and <1, 3, 9>. 

Therefore, the answer is [5].
