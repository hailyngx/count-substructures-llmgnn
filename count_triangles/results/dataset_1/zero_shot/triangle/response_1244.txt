Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
<4, 7, 5>
<6, 8, 1>
<7, 9, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.
