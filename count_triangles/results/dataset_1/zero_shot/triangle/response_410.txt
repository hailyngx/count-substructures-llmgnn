Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total. 
The final answer is [8].
