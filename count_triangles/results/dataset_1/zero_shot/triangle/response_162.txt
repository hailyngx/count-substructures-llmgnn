Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be counted by examining every possible set of three nodes that are connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

[<0, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <4, 5, 7>]

Total number of triangles: [5]
