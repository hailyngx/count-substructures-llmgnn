Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: <0, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 8, 5>, and <8, 9, 6>.

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
