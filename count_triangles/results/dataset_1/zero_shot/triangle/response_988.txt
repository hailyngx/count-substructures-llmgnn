Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that form a triangle. 

After examining the provided edges in the graph, we can list the unique triangles as follows:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is: [8]
