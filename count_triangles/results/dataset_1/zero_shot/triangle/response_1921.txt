Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 17 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 9, 1>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 9, 3>
<1, 9, 4>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 3, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 6, 9>
<9, 8, 3>

Therefore, the answer is [17].
