Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 6>
<5, 4, 6>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
