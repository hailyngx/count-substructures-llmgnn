Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
