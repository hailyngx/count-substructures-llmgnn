Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles present in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
