Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. Below is the list of unique triangles along with the final answer:

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
