Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be counted by finding all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's list out the unique triangles:

<3, 1, 9>
<5, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
