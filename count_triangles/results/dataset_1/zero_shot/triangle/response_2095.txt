Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>  
<1, 2, 9>  
<1, 3, 4>  
<2, 6, 4>  
<2, 6, 0>  
<4, 6, 0>  
<4, 6, 2>  
<9, 1, 2>  
<9, 1, 4>  
<9, 2, 5>  

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total.  
The final answer is [10].
