Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 0>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 0>
<4, 8, 2>
<5, 1, 0>
<6, 8, 2>
<6, 9, 0>
<8, 1, 5>
<8, 2, 6>
<8, 4, 0>
<8, 6, 9>
<8, 9, 0>
<9, 6, 0>

There are 21 triangles in total, therefore the answer is [21].
