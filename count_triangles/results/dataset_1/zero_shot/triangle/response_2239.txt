Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:

<1, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<5, 8, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<0, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
