Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The possible triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] unique triangles in the graph.
