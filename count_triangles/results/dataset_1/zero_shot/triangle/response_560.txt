Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 8, 9>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
