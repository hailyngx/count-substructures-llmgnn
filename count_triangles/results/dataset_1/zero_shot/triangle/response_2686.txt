Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
