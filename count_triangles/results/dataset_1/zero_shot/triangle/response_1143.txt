Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 5, 8>, <5, 1, 3>, <5, 3, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 2>, <0, 8, 3>, <3, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 4>]   [8 triangles]
