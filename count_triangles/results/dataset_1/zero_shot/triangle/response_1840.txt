Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <1, 2, 4>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, and <4, 8, 9> triangles in the given graph.
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
