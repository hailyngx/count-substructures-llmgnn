Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by finding all unique combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
<8, 9, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [8].
