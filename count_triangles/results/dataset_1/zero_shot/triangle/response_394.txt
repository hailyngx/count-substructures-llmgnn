Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be counted by looking at each combination of three nodes that form a closed triangle. 

After considering all combinations, the triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 7, 2>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
