Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's first list all the triangles present:
- Triangle 1: <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle 2: <5, 6, 7>

Hence, we have found two triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
