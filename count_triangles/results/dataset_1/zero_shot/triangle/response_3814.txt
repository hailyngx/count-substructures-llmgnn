Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can form the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
