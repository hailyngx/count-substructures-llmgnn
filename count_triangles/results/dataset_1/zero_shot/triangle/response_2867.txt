Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<3, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

There are [2] triangles in total.
