Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are:
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
