Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{v \in V} \binom{\text{deg}(v)}{2} \]

where \(V\) is the set of vertices and \( \text{deg}(v) \) is the degree of vertex \( v \). The binomial coefficient \( \binom{\text{deg}(v)}{2} \) represents the number of ways to choose 2 edges incident to vertex \( v \), which is effectively the number of triangles that can be formed using vertex \( v \) as one of the vertices.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges:

- Node 0: degree = 4
- Node 1: degree = 2
- Node 2: degree = 5
- Node 3: degree = 3
- Node 4: degree = 3
- Node 5: degree = 4
- Node 6: degree = 2
- Node 8: degree = 6
- Node 9: degree = 2

Plugging in these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \left( \binom{4}{2} + \binom{2}{2} + \binom{5}{2} + \binom{3}{2} + \binom{3}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{2}{2} + \binom{6}{2} + \binom{2}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{6} \left( 6 + 1 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 15 + 1 \right) = \frac{46}{6} = 7.67 \]

This means there are 7 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are as follows: <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <8, 9, 1>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [7].
