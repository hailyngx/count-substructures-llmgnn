Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <3, 7, 5>
3. <3, 7, 4>
4. <2, 8, 1>
5. <2, 8, 4>
6. <2, 8, 1>
7. <2, 0, 3>
8. <2, 4, 8>
9. <4, 7, 5>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the graph.  
The final answer is [9].
