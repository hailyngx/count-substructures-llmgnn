Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in total.
