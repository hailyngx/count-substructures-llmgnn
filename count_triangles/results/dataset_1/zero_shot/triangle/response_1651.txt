Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are \[10\] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are:

<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is \[10\].
