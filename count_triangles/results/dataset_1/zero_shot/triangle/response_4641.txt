Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted as follows:

Number of triangles = (Number of triangles formed by each node) / 3

For each node, we need to check if there are two edges between each pair of its neighbors to form a triangle. Let's count the triangles:

1. Node 0: (1,2,4)
2. Node 1: (0,5,9)
3. Node 2: (0,9,4)
4. Node 4: (0,7,9)
5. Node 5: (1,9,7)
6. Node 7: (4,9,5)
7. Node 9: (2,7,5)

Calculating the total number of triangles = 7 triangles / 3 = [2]

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
