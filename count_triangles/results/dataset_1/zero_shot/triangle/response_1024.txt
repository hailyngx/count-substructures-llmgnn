Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in this graph. They are:
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 1>
<0, 7, 4>
So, the final answer is [7].
