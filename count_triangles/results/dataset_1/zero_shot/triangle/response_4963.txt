Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of and then dividing the total count by 3, since each triangle involves 3 nodes. 

Node 0 is a part of 5 triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 4, 9>.
Node 1 is a part of 1 triangle: <1, 0, 4>.
Node 2 is a part of 1 triangle: <2, 0, 5>.
Node 3 is a part of 1 triangle: <3, 5, 9>.
Node 4 is a part of 3 triangles: <4, 0, 6>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 5, 9>.
Node 5 is a part of 7 triangles: <5, 2, 0>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 9, 3>, <5, 7, 3>, <5, 9, 4>, <5, 4, 1>, <5, 2, 0>.
Node 6 is a part of 1 triangle: <6, 0, 4>.
Node 7 is a part of 1 triangle: <7, 3, 5>.
Node 8 is a part of 1 triangle: <8, 5, 7>.
Node 9 is a part of 2 triangles: <9, 3, 5>, <9, 4, 5>.

Total count of triangles = 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 22
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [22].
