Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
  
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>

There are 10 triangles in total.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
