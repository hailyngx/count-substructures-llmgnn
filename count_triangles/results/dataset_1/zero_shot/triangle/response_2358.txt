Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has multiple triangles. Let's count them:

1. Triangle 1: <1, 6, 9>
2. Triangle 2: <1, 7, 9>
3. Triangle 3: <2, 5, 9>
4. Triangle 4: <2, 7, 9>
5. Triangle 5: <6, 7, 9>

There are 5 triangles found in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [5].
