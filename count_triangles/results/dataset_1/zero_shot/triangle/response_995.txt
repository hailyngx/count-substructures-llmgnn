Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 18 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 9, 5>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 0>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 0>
<3, 1, 4>
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 2, 8>
<4, 1, 9>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 1, 3>
<8, 2, 3>
<8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
