Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The unique triangles found in the given graph are:
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 3>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 0, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 1, 9>
<7, 2, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
