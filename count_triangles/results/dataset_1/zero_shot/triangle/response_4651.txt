Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
