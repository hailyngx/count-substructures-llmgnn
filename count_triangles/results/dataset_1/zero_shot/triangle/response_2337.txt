Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<1, 3, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<2, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the graph.
