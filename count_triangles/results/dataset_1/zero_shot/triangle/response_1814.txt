Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 5, 3>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 0, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
