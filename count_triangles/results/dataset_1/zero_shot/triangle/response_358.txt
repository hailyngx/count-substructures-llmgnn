Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph forms the following triangles:
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <8, 6, 9>

There are 14 unique triangles in total. Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
