Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is involved in. Let's calculate it.

- Node 0 is involved in 0 triangles.
- Node 1 is involved in 2 triangles: <1, 3, 5> and <1, 5, 9>.
- Node 2 is involved in 0 triangles.
- Node 3 is involved in 0 triangles.
- Node 4 is involved in 2 triangles: <0, 4, 6> and <4, 6, 9>.
- Node 5 is involved in 3 triangles: <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, and <1, 5, 2>.
- Node 6 is involved in 3 triangles: <0, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, and <4, 6, 5>.
- Node 9 is involved in 3 triangles: <1, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <9, 6, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 11.
