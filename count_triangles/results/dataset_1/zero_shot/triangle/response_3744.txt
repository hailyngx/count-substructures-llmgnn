Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: <0, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 6>. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
