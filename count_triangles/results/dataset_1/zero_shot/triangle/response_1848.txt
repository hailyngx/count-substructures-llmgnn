Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] triangles in the given graph. These triangles are: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, and <2, 3, 4>.
