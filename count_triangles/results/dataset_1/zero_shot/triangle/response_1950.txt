Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 8, 9>.
