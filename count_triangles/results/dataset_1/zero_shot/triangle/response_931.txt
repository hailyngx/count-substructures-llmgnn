Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
