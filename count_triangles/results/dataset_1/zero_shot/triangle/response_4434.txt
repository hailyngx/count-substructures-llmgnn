Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<1, 3, 4>, <4, 2, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <3, 1, 9>, <6, 9, 3> 

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in total. 
So, the final answer is [5].
