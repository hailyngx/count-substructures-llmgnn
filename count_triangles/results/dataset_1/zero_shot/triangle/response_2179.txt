Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After evaluating the graph with the provided edges, the total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 6>.
