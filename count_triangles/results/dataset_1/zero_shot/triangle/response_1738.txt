Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be represented by the following unique sets of nodes:

<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 7, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 4>
<5, 7, 1>
<7, 5, 3>
<7, 8, 3>

There are 10 unique triangles in the given graph, thus the answer is [10].
