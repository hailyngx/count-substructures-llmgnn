Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: 

<0, 1, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
