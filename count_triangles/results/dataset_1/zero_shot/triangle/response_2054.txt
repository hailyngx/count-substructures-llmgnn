Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The unique triangles in this graph are:

<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 8, 7>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 1>
<8, 7, 3>
<8, 7, 9>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
