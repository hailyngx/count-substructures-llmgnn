Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is part of. 

Counting triangles for each node:
- Node 0 is part of 0 triangles.
- Node 1 is part of 3 triangles: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 5>.
- Node 2 is part of 1 triangle: <1, 2, 3>.
- Node 3 is part of 7 triangles: <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 9>.
- Node 4 is part of 1 triangle: <1, 4, 5>.
- Node 5 is part of 2 triangles: <1, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 9>.
- Node 6 is part of 1 triangle: <2, 3, 6>.
- Node 7 is part of 2 triangles: <3, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
- Node 8 is part of 1 triangle: <0, 3, 8>.
- Node 9 is part of 2 triangles: <3, 5, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.

Adding them all up gives us a total of 20 triangles. So, the answer is [20].
