Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in this graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 4>,  
<0, 6, 8>,  
<1, 4, 8>,  
<1, 4, 9>,  
<1, 9, 7>,  
<2, 3, 6>,  
<2, 3, 9>,  
<3, 6, 4>,  
<3, 6, 8>,  
<4, 5, 8>,  
<4, 6, 8>,  
<5, 7, 9>,  
<5, 8, 6>,  
<8, 9, 7>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
