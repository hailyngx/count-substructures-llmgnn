Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in this graph. The triangles are <1, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <4, 3, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
