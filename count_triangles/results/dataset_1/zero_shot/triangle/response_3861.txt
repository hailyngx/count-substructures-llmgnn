Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by identifying all possible combinations of three nodes that are interconnected.

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Thus, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [9].
