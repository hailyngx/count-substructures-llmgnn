Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the sets of three nodes that are fully connected by edges. 

Looking at the given edges, we can see the following triangles:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<4, 1, 7>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph, as counted above. 

So, the final answer is [5].
