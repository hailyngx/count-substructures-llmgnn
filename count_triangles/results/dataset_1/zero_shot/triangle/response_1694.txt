Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here is a list of the unique triangles:

<0, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 2, 9>
<6, 5, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
