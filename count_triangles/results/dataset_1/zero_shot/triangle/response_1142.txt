Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as:

```
    1---7
    |   |
    9---2
     \ / \
      0---5
       \ /
        4---8
         \
          3---6
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle by having edges between each pair of nodes in the triplet.

Counting the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle: <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle: <0, 2, 9>
3. Triangle: <0, 5, 4>
4. Triangle: <2, 5, 3>
5. Triangle: <3, 4, 8>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. The answer is [5].
