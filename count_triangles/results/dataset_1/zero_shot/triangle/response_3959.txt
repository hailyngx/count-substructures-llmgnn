Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <5, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 8>.

Total number of triangles: [6]
