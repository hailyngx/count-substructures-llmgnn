Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated based on the number of triangles each node belongs to. Here is the count of triangles in the graph:

- Node 0 is part of 2 triangles
- Node 1 is part of 1 triangle
- Node 2 is part of 3 triangles
- Node 3 is part of 4 triangles
- Node 4 is part of 3 triangles
- Node 5 is part of 1 triangle
- Node 6 is part of 4 triangles
- Node 7 is part of 2 triangles
- Node 8 is part of 1 triangle
- Node 9 is part of 3 triangles

Adding these up, the total number of triangles in the graph is (2 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 3) / 3 = 24 triangles.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<0, 2, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<6, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [24] triangles in the given graph.
