Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, and <3, 4, 9>. Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
