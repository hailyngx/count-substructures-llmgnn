Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
