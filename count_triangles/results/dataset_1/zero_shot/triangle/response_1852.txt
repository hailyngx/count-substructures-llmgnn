Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 5>, <3, 9, 8>, <5, 6, 1>, and <5, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
