Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is 8. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, and <4, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
