Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a simple graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node participates in and then dividing by 6 since each triangle is counted 3 times (once from each node). Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph.

For node 0: (0, 5), (0, 9), (5, 9) form a triangle. So, node 0 participates in 1 triangle.
For node 1: No triangles.
For node 2: No triangles.
For node 3: No triangles.
For node 4: No triangles.
For node 5: (0, 5, 9) and (4, 5, 8) form triangles. So, node 5 participates in 2 triangles.
For node 6: (4, 6, 9) and (5, 6, 7) form triangles. So, node 6 participates in 2 triangles.
For node 7: (1, 7, 3), (4, 7, 6), and (5, 7, 8) form triangles. So, node 7 participates in 3 triangles.
For node 8: (2, 8, 3), (5, 8, 7), and (6, 8, 9) form triangles. So, node 8 participates in 3 triangles.
For node 9: (0, 9, 4) and (6, 9, 4) form triangles. So, node 9 participates in 2 triangles.

Adding up the triangles each node participates in: 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 13

Dividing by 6 to get the actual number of triangles gives 13 / 6 = 2 remainder 1.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 5, 9> and <5, 6, 7>.

So, the final answer is [2].
