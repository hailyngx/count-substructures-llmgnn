Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <2, 0, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 0, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>.
