Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented by the following adjacency list:
```
0: [1, 2, 3, 8]
1: [0, 3, 4, 5, 7]
2: [0, 3]
3: [0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9]
4: [1, 3, 9]
5: [1, 6, 9]
6: [5, 9]
7: [1, 3]
8: [0]
9: [3, 4, 5, 6]
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, let's first identify the unique triangles:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <3, 7, 9>
6. <5, 9, 6>

There are 6 unique triangles in the graph, so the final answer is [6].
