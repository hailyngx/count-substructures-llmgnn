Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following edges:
- 0: {4, 5, 6}
- 1: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- 2: {1, 3, 6}
- 3: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- 4: {0, 1, 3, 9}
- 5: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- 6: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- 7: {1, 5, 9}
- 8: {6}
- 9: {4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph by identifying the unique triangles:

1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <1, 3, 4>
4. <1, 4, 7>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <3, 5, 9>
7. <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
