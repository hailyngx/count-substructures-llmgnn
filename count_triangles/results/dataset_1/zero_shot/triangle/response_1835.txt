Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 9>.

Thus, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
