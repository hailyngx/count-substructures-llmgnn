Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be counted by finding all possible combinations of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

After examining the given graph, the unique triangles found are: 
<2, 1, 5> 
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 1, 8>
<4, 3, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<8, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
