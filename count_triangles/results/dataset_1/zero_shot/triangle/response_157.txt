Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node participates in and dividing by 3 (since each triangle is counted three times, once for each of its nodes). 

By examining the given graph, we can identify the triangles as follows: 

- Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 4.
- Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 4.
- Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 7 and 2.
- Node 6 forms a triangle with node 8.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9] ( <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 1>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8> ).
