Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 9, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<4, 1, 9>
<5, 2, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
<9, 4, 7>

There are a total of 9 unique triangles in this graph. So, the final answer is [9].
