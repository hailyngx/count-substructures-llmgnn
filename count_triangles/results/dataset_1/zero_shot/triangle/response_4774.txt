Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 6>, 
<1, 3, 4>, 
<3, 4, 5>.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in total.
