Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of unique triangles in this graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of.

Calculating the number of triangles for each node:
- Node 0: 5 triangles
- Node 1: 2 triangles
- Node 2: 4 triangles
- Node 3: 1 triangle
- Node 4: 1 triangle
- Node 5: 3 triangles
- Node 6: 4 triangles
- Node 7: 0 triangles
- Node 8: 5 triangles
- Node 9: 1 triangle

Adding up all the triangles from each node, the total number of triangles in the graph is: 26

Therefore, the answer is [26] and the unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
