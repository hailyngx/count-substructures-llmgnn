Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<1, 4, 6>, 
<4, 6, 8>, 
<4, 8, 9>, 
<4, 8, 6>, 
<8, 7, 9>, 
<8, 9, 7>.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
