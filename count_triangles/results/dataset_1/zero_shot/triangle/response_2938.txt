Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 3>
<7, 8, 9>
