Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<2, 4, 7>  
<2, 4, 8>  
<2, 5, 6>  
<2, 6, 8>  
<3, 8, 9>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
