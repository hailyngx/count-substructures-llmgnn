Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 15 triangles.
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 2, 9>, <8, 6, 9>.
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
