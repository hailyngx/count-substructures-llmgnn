Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 5>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 7, 5>
<6, 9, 0>
<6, 9, 5>
Therefore, the answer is [13].
