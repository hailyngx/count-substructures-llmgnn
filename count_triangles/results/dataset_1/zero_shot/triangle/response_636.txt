Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 8>.
