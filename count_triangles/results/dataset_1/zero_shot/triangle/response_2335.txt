Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The unique triangles in this graph are:

<0, 1, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

There are [4] triangles in total.
