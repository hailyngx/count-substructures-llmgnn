Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are in unique form:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<9, 1, 2>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
