Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles around each node. Here is the detail:

- Node 0: 0 triangles
- Node 1: 2 triangles <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>
- Node 2: 2 triangles <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>
- Node 3: 4 triangles <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 5>
- Node 4: 4 triangles <1, 4, 2>, <3, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 9>
- Node 5: 2 triangles <2, 5, 3>, <3, 5, 4>
- Node 6: 1 triangle <1, 6, 2>
- Node 7: 0 triangles
- Node 8: 1 triangle <1, 8, 3>
- Node 9: 1 triangle <4, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16] <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 3>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 8, 3>, <4, 9, 7>.
