Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets and each enclosed in <>:

[<2, 4, 8> <3, 4, 9> <3, 4, 8> <4, 5, 3>]
