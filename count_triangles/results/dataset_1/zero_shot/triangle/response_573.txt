Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 4.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
