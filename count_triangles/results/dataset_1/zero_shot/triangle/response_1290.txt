Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 7, 3>, <0, 6, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <6, 4, 9> 

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in total. Thus, the answer is [5].
