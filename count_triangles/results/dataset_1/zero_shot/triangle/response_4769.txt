Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining each unique combination of three nodes that are connected by edges. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

<1, 2, 3>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>

Thus, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
