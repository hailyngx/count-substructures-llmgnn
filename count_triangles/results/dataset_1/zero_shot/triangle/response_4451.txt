Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 8, 6>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 8, 6>
<4, 5, 9>

The final answer is [7].
