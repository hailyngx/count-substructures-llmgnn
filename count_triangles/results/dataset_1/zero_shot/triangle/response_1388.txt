Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is 4. The unique triangles are: <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, and <4, 2, 8>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
