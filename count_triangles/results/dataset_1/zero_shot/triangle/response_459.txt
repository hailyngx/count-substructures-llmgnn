Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
