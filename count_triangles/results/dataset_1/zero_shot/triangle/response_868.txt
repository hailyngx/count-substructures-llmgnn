Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:  
<0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
