Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>.
