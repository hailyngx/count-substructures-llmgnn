Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<4, 2, 5>
<4, 2, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
Therefore, there are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [11].
