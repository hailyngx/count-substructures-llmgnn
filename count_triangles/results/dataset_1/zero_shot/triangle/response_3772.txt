Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
This graph has the following triangles: [<1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 9, 3>, <3, 9, 1>]
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
