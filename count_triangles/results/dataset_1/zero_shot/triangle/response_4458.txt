Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, and <1, 4, 8>. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
