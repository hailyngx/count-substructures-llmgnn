Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in total. So, the final answer is [4].
