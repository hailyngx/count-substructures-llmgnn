Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 15 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles listed inside brackets:

[<1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 5, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <5, 7, 9>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 5, 0>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 5>, <1, 4, 3>, <3, 7, 9>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
