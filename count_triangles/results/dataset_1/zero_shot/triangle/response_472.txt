Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [9].

The unique triangles are <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 3>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 2>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 2>, <5, 9, 2>.
