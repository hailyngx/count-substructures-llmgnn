Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [28] triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 2>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 9>.
