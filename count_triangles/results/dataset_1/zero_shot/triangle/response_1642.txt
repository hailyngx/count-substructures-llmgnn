Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining each triplet of nodes to see if they form a closed triangle. 

Upon analyzing the given graph, the triangles found are as follows:
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 5>
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
