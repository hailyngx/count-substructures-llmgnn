Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 9, 4>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 5>
<3, 9, 5>
<3, 9, 7>
<4, 8, 2>
<5, 7, 3>
<6, 0, 9>
<6, 1, 9>
<9, 3, 1>
<9, 3, 5>
<9, 4, 2>
<9, 6, 0>
<9, 6, 1>

There are 23 unique triangles in total. So, the final answer is [23].
