Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated. We can see the triangles by looking at the three-cycles in the graph.

The triangles in the given graph are:
- <0, 3, 1>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <3, 7, 5>
- <3, 7, 6>
- <3, 9, 8>
- <4, 9, 5>
- <7, 5, 6>
- <9, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. The final answer is [10].
