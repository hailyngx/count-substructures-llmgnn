Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<0, 3, 1>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 4>
<3, 1, 8>
<3, 4, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
