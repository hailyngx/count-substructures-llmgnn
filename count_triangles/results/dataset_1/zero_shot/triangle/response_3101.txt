Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles:

<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 1, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
