Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
   1 --- 2 --- 6
   |     |     |
   7     5     |
           \    |
             3   9
             |
             4
             |
             8
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all possible triangles based on the given edges. 

Upon examining the graph, we find the following triangles:
1. <1, 2, 6>
2. <1, 7, 8>
3. <2, 6, 5>
4. <3, 4, 8>
5. <4, 8, 7>

Hence, there are 5 triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
