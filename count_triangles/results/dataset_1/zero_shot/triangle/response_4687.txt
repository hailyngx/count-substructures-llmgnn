Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 1, 8>
<2, 1, 9>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 2, 6>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 0>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 0>
<5, 8, 0>
<7, 0, 8>
<8, 0, 9>
<9, 2, 6>

Therefore, there are [23] triangles in total.
