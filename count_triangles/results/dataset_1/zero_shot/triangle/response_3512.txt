Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [16] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 1, 4>
<6, 3, 5>
<9, 4, 5>
<9, 7, 0>
<9, 7, 5>
<9, 7, 2>
<9, 7, 4>
<9, 7, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is: [16].
