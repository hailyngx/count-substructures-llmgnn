Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are total [20] triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 9, 5>, <0, 9, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 6>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 9, 6>, <2, 9, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 9, 5>, <5, 6, 4>, <5, 9, 6>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 5>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
