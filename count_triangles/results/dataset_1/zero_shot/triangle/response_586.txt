Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 1>, <5, 8, 3>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 0, 8>. Therefore, there are 8 unique triangles in the graph.  
So, the final answer is [8].
