Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles are <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 1>, <3, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>.
