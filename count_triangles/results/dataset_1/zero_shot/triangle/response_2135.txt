Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by counting the number of unique triangles formed by 3 nodes that are connected with edges. Let's now count the triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
