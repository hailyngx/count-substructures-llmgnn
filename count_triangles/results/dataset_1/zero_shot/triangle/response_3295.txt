Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<1, 6, 9>, <4, 2, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <7, 5, 9> 

There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
