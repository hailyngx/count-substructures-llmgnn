Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
