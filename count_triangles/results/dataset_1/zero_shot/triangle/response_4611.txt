Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 9), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 4), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find the number of unique paths of length 2 between any three distinct nodes.

Following are the unique triangles in the graph:
<0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 9, 4>, <0, 9, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <3, 2, 5>, <4, 8, 0>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 9, 5>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 7, 0>, <9, 5, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [18].
