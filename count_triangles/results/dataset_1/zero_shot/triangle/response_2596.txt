Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 1>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 7, 2>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 8>.

There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
