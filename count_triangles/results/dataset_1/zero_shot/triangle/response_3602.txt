Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
