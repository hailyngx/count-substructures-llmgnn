Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [18] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are listed below inside brackets:

[<1, 2, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 9, 6>, <4, 9, 6>, <7, 9, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 9>]
