Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are <0, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, and <3, 5, 6> triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
