Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph is calculated by counting the number of closed paths of length 3. In this case, the graph is directed since the edges have directions specified.

The triangles present in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 0, 5>
<1, 0, 8>
<1, 4, 0>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 5, 0>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 8, 0>
<1, 8, 6>
<2, 1, 4>
<4, 0, 1>
<4, 0, 2>
<4, 1, 0>
<4, 1, 2>
<5, 0, 1>
<5, 0, 6>
<5, 1, 0>
<5, 1, 6>
<6, 0, 5>
<6, 0, 8>
<6, 2, 1>
<6, 5, 0>
<6, 5, 1>
<6, 8, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [34].
