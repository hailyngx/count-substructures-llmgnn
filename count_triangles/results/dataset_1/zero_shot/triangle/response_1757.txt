Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by examining all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are connected to each other. By counting the triangles, we can determine the total number of triangles present in the graph.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 6>
<0, 9, 3>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 8, 5>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 9, 6>
<5, 8, 6>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [24].
