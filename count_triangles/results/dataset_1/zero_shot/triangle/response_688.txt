Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 1>
<2, 0, 7>
<2, 6, 3>
<3, 4, 6>
<5, 2, 6>
<9, 0, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
