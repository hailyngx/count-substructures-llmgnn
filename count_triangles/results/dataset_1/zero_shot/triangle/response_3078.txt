Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by examining each possible set of 3 nodes and checking if they form a triangle. Since triangles are fully connected subgraphs of size 3, we need to look for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

In the given graph, the triangles are formed by the following node sets:
1. <1, 4, 9>
2. <4, 7, 9>
3. <4, 5, 8>
4. <4, 6, 8>
5. <5, 6, 8>
6. <5, 7, 8>
7. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is: [7]
