Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 9>.
