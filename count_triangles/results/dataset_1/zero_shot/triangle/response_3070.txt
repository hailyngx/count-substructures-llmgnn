Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, and <4, 7, 9>.
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
