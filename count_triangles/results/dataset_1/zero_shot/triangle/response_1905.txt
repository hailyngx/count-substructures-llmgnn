Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes.

Calculating the number of triangles:

1. For a triangle to form, there need to be three connections among three nodes. Let's look at each node separately:
   
- **Node 0:** (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7) - forms triangles with nodes 1, 4, 6, 7.
  
- **Node 1:** (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 7) - forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, 7.
  
- **Node 2:** (2, 8), (2, 9) - no triangles as it has only two connections.
  
- **Node 3:** (3, 1), (3, 4) - forms a triangle with node 4.
  
- **Node 4:** (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5) - forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, 5.
  
- **Node 5:** (5, 4), (5, 7) - no triangles as it has only two connections.
  
- **Node 6:** (6, 0) - no triangles as it has only one connection.
  
- **Node 7:** (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 5) - forms triangles with nodes 0, 1, 5.
  
- **Node 8:** (8, 2), (8, 9) - forms a triangle with node 9.
  
- **Node 9:** (9, 2), (9, 8) - forms a triangle with node 8.

Unique triangles present in the graph: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <8, 9, 2>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
