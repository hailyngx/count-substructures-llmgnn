Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's analyze the graph.

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are listed below:

(0, 8)
(1, 3)
(3, 1)
(3, 4)
(4, 3)
(4, 7)
(5, 8)
(6, 7)
(6, 8)
(7, 4)
(7, 6)
(8, 0)
(8, 5)
(8, 6)

Let's list down the unique triangles:

<3, 4, 7>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 7, 8>
<0, 8, 5>

So, there are only 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
