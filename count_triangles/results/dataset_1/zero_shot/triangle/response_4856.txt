Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [2].

The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4> and <4, 7, 9>.
