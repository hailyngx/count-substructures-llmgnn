Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 8, 7>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
