Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- From the given edges, we can find the triangles by looking for three nodes that form a closed loop.
- The unique triangles in this graph are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <6, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in this graph is 7, which can be represented as [7].
