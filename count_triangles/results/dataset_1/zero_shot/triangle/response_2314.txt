Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 7, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 5>.

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
