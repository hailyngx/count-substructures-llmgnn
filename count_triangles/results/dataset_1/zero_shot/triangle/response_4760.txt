Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are total of 21 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<2, 7, 9>, <6, 0, 1>, <6, 2, 1>, <6, 2, 5>, <6, 2, 4>, <8, 7, 9>, <8, 3, 9>, <8, 2, 1>, <8, 2, 5>, <8, 2, 9>, <8, 2, 7>, <8, 3, 4>, <5, 0, 6>, <5, 0, 2>, <5, 0, 8>, <2, 9, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 1, 6>, <7, 9, 2>
Therefore, the final answer is [21].
