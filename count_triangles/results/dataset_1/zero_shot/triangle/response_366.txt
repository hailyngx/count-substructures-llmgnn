Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 6, 3>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 6, 3>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
