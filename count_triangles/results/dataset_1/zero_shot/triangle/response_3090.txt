Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 5>
<7, 4, 9>
<7, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
