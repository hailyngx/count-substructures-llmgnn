Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First let's represent the given graph in terms of adjacency list for easier visualization:
```
0: [3]
1: [4, 7]
3: [0, 4]
4: [1, 3, 6, 9]
6: [4, 7]
7: [1, 6, 8]
8: [7]
9: [4]
```

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

The triangles are:
1. <1, 4, 6>
2. <1, 4, 7>
3. <1, 7, 6>
4. <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
