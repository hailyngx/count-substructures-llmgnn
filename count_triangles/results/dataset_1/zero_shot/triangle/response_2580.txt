Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

        0-----5
        |     | \
        |     |  9
        |     | /
        4-----1-----6
             |
             |
             2-----8
              \
               7

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected.

Upon examining the graph, we can see that there are three triangles present:
1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <5, 4, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
