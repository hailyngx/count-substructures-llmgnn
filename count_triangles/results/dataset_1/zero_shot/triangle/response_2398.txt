Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be counted by looking for all possible triangles formed by the given edges. In this case, we count the triangles as follows:

<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 2>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
