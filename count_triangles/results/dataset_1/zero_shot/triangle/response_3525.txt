Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<1, 2, 3>
<4, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<5, 9, 7>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
