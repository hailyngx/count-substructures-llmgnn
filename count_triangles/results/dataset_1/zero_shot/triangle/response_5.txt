Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, and <5, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
