Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 7>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
