Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of. 

For this graph, the triangles are:
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 5>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in this graph.
