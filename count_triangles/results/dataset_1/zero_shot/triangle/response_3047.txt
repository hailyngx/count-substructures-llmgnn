Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
       0----8
       |    | \
       |    |  4
       8----6  |
        \  |   |
          \|   |
            9--|
            |
      1-----2-----7
            |
            3
            |
            5
```

There are a total of [10] triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are:
<2, 7, 3>, <2, 7, 5>, <2, 1, 3>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 0>, <6, 8, 4>, <6, 8, 9>, <8, 0, 4>
