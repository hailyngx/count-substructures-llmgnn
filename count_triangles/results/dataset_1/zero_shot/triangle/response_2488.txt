Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles present in the graph is [5].
