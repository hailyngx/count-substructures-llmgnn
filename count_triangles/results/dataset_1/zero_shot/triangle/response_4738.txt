Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 6 triangles. Here are the unique triangles found:

- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <6, 9, 7>
- <8, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
