Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:  
<0, 7, 1>  
<0, 8, 2>  
<0, 8, 3>  
<0, 8, 4>  
<2, 5, 3>  
<2, 5, 4>  
<3, 4, 8>  
<4, 5, 3>  
<4, 5, 6>  
<4, 5, 9>  
<4, 7, 1>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
