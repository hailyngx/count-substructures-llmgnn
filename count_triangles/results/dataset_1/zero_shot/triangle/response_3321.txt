Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique paths of length 2 between each set of 3 distinct nodes. 

Let's enumerate the triangles we find:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 1>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 9, 3>
<4, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 8, 6>
<3, 9, 4>
<6, 7, 8>

Counting the triangles, the final answer is [17].
