Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 6>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
