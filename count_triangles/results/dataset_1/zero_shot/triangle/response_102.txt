Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <0, 2, 8>, <7, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
