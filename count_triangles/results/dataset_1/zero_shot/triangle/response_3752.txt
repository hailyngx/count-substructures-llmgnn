Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in a graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down all the triangles in this graph:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <2, 1, 0>
5. <8, 0, 5>
6. <8, 9, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.

The final answer is [6].
