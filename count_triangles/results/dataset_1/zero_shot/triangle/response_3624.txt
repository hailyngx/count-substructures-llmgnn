Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of triangles formed by 3 nodes connected by edges.

There are 4 unique triangles in the given graph:
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
