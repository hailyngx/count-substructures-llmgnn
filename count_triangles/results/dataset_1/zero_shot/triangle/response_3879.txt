Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by looping through all possible triangles in the graph and checking if they actually form a triangle by having all three edges present. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 7, 3>
<2, 3, 1>
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 7, 4>
<3, 4, 1>
<3, 7, 4>
<3, 8, 1>
<3, 9, 6>
<4, 5, 0>
<4, 7, 2>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 9, 3>
<8, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are [15] triangles in total.
