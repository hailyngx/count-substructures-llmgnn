Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by summing up the triangles formed around each node. Let's calculate it.

For each node:
Node 0 has triangles <0, 1, 6> and <0, 6, 8>.
Node 1 has a triangle <1, 0, 6> and <1, 0, 9>.
Node 2 doesn't form any triangles.
Node 3 has triangles <3, 4, 5> and <3, 5, 6>.
Node 4 has a triangle <4, 3, 5>.
Node 5 has a triangle <5, 3, 6>.
Node 6 has a triangle <6, 0, 3>.
Node 7 doesn't form any triangles.
Node 8 has a triangle <8, 0, 3>.
Node 9 has a triangle <9, 1, 4> and <9, 1, 5>.

Adding them up, we find that there are a total of 7 unique triangles in the graph:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 0, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<9, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
