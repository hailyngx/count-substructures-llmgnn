Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by finding the number of 3-cycles. Let's find the triangles in the given graph:

The unique triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
