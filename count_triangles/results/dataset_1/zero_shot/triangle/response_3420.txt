Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<5, 3, 6>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 8 triangles in the graph. [8]
