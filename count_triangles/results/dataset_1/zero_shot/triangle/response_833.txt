Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [15].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 9, 3>
<2, 9, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 9>
<8, 3, 5>
<8, 3, 9>
<8, 5, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
