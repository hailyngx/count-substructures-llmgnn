Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for groups of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's examine each possible triangle in the graph:

1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 3, and 4: <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangle involving nodes 0, 4, and 6: <0, 4, 6>
3. Triangle involving nodes 1, 4, and 2: <1, 4, 2>
4. Triangle involving nodes 4, 2, and 5: <4, 2, 5>
5. Triangle involving nodes 4, 6, and 0: <4, 6, 0>
6. Triangle involving nodes 4, 6, and 8: <4, 6, 8>
7. Triangle involving nodes 4, 7, and 1: <4, 7, 1>
8. Triangle involving nodes 4, 7, and 2: <4, 7, 2>
9. Triangle involving nodes 6, 8, and 2: <6, 8, 2>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. The answer is [9].
