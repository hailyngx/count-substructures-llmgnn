Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<1, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 8>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
