Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 5>, <4, 6, 9>. 

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
