Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph is 2.

The unique triangles are <0, 2, 8> and <3, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the answer is [2].
