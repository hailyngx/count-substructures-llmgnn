Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted using the given edges. After carefully examining the graph, the triangles found in the graph are: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <7, 6, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 8.
