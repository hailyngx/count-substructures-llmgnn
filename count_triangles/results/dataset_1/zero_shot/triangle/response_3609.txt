Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, and <3, 5, 9>.

There are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
