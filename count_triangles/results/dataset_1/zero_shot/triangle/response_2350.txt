Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
