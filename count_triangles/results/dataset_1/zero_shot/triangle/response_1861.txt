Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the graph.   
So, the final answer is [6].
