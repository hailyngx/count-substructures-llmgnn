Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
