Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [16] triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles: <5, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <1, 9, 3>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 8, 9>
