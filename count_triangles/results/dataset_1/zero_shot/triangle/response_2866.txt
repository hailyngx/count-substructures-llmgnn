Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<8, 9, 2>
<8, 9, 3>
<9, 7, 8>

So, there are [12] triangles in total.
