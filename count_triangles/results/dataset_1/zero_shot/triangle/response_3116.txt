Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be calculated based on the number of triangles each node is involved in. 

I will list the unique triangles and then count the total number of triangles.

The unique triangles in this graph are:

<0, 1, 2>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
