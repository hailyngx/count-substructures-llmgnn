Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is [8].
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.
