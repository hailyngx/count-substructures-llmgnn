Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles:

<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 8, 1>
<5, 6, 7>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
