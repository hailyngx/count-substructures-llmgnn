Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: <1, 5, 8>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 6, 9>, <7, 9, 6>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
