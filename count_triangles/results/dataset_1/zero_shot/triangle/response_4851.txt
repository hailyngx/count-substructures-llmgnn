Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a simple graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(d_i - 1)(d_i - 2) \]

where \( n \) is the total number of nodes and \( d_i \) is the degree of node \( i \).

In this graph:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2

Therefore, applying the formula:

\[ \frac{1}{3}[(3)(2)(1) + (3)(2)(1) + (2)(1)(0) + (5)(4)(3) + (4)(3)(2) + (4)(3)(2) + (4)(3)(2) + (3)(2)(1) + (2)(1)(0) + (2)(1)(0)] = 8 \]

Hence, there are a total of 8 triangles in this graph.

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 3>, <8, 0, 2>, <3, 2, 4>, <3, 2, 6>

Therefore, the final answer is: [8].
