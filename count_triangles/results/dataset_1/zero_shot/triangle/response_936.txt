Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by looking for unique cycles of length 3. To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles present.

Looking at the given graph, we can list the unique triangles below:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 5>
<0, 9, 3>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 6>
<3, 7, 4>
<3, 7, 5>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 3>
<4, 7, 5>
<5, 7, 3>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 4> 

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
