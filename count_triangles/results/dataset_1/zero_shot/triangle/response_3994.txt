Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible sets of three nodes that form a triangle.

The triangles in the graph are:
- <0, 6, 9>
- <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
