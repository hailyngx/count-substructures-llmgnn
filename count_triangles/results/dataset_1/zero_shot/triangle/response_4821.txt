Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph represents the following connections between the nodes:

0 : [2, 4, 5, 6, 8]
1 : [8]
2 : [0, 5]
3 : [4, 7]
4 : [0, 3, 7, 9]
5 : [0, 2, 7, 9]
6 : [0, 8]
7 : [3, 4, 5, 8]
8 : [0, 1, 6, 7]
9 : [4, 5]

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. After examining the connections between the nodes, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <0, 6, 8>
5. <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
