Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 9, 8>, <0, 8, 2>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 7, 4>, <4, 7, 6>, <6, 3, 7>, <6, 3, 8>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 4, 5>, <8, 2, 3>, <8, 2, 7>, <8, 3, 7>, <8, 6, 3>, <8, 6, 4>, <8, 6, 7>, and <8, 6, 3>.
