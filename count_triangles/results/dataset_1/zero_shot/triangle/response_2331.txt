Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 1 -- 4
|    |    |
2    7 -- 5
     |
     6
     
3 -- 9 -- 8
|
5
```

Now, let's count the number of triangles present in the graph:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 2, 7>
- Triangle 4: <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle 5: <2, 7, 0>
- Triangle 6: <2, 7, 5>
- Triangle 7: <3, 9, 8>
- Triangle 8: <4, 1, 7>
- Triangle 9: <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle 10: <7, 5, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 0>, <2, 7, 5>, <3, 9, 8>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <7, 5, 0>.
