Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <4, 7, 8>.
