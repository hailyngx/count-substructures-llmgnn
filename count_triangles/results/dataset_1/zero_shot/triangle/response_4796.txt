Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph. The triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 0>, <1, 9, 5>, <1, 9, 4>, <4, 8, 1>.
