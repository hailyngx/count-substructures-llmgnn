Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 0>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 0, 7>
<3, 8, 5>
<6, 4, 8>
<6, 8, 7>
<7, 0, 9>
<8, 3, 0>
<8, 5, 9>
<8, 6, 4>
<8, 6, 7>
<8, 7, 0>
<8, 7, 1>
<8, 7, 9>
<8, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
