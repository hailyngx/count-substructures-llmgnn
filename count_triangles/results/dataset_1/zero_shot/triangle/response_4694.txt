Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 1>

There are [9] triangles in total.
