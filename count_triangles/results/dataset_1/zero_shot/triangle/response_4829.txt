Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, and <6, 7, 8>.  
Therefore, the final answer is [7].
