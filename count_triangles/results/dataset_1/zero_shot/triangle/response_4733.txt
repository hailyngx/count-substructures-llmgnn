Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 4>
<2, 8, 3>
<9, 5, 3>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
