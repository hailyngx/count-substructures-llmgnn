Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by examining the number of triangles each node is a part of. Here is the list of triangles along with the count:

[<1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>] 

So, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
