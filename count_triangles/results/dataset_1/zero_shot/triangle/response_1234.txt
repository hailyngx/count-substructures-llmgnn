Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 8, 6>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 9, 4>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 9, 4>
<3, 9, 6>
<4, 1, 2>
<4, 1, 9>
<4, 2, 1>
<4, 2, 9>
<4, 6, 0>
<4, 6, 3>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 9, 1>
<4, 9, 2>
<4, 9, 3>
<6, 0, 8>
<6, 3, 9>
<6, 4, 0>
<6, 4, 3>
<6, 4, 8>
<6, 8, 0>
<6, 8, 4>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 8>
<8, 0, 6>
<8, 0, 7>
<8, 6, 0>
<8, 6, 4>
<8, 6, 7>
<8, 7, 0>
<8, 7, 9>
<9, 2, 4>

<9, 4, 1>
<9, 4, 2>
<9, 4, 3>
<9, 7, 8>
<9, 7, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of [48] triangles in the given graph.
