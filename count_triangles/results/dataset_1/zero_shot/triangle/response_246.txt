Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets []:

[<0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 0, 3>, <8, 6, 9>]
