Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by looking for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After examining the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 8, 2>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 9, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<8, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
