Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 8, 6>
<0, 9, 5>
<3, 9, 6>
<3, 8, 6>
<3, 8, 7>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
