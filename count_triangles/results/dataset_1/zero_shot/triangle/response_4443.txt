Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 3>, <2, 4, 5>, <6, 0, 7>, <6, 3, 7>, <7, 8, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
