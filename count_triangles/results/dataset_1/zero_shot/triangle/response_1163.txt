Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles formed by 3 connected nodes.

Based on the given edges, the unique triangles in the graph are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 7, 9>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
