Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by finding all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are connected by edges.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
