Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 0>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 9, 8>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 1>
<7, 3, 7>
<7, 8, 9>
<9, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the graph. [10]
