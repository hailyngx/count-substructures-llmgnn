Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the given edges.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
