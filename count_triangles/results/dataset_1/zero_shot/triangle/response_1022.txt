Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles:

<0, 6, 1>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 9, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 7, 3>
<5, 9, 0>
<6, 1, 8>
<7, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
