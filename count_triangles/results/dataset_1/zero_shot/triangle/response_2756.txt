Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
