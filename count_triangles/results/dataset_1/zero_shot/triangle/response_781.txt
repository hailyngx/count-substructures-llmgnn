Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are total [16] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 7, 4>
<3, 9, 8>
Therefore, the final answer is [16].
