Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 7, 9>.
