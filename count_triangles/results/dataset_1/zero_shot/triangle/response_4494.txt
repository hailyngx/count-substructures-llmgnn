Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of triangles formed by each triplet of nodes. 

The unique triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
