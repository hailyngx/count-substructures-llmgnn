Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 7, 9>
<3, 9, 7>
<3, 8, 5>
<6, 9, 7>
<8, 4, 5> 

Therefore, there are a total of [14] triangles in the graph.
