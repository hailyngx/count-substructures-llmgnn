Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <2, 0, 4>, <3, 4, 5>, and <9, 0, 5>.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
