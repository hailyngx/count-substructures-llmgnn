Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 5, 2>
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 1>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 5>
<4, 1, 5>
<4, 2, 5>
<5, 1, 3>
<5, 1, 7>
<5, 2, 4>
<5, 2, 6>
<6, 5, 0>
<7, 1, 3>
<7, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 6>

There are 18 triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [18].
