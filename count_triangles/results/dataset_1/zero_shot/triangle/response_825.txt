Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in total.
