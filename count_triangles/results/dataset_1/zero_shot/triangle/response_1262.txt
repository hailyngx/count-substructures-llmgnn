Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>]
