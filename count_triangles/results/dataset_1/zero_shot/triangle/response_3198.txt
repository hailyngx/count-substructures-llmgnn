Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
