Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 7>

There are 4 unique triangles in total. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
