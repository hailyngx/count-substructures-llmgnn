Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 4>, <3, 4, 5>, <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in total. Hence, the final answer is [3].
