Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting all unique combinations of three nodes that are all connected with each other.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
