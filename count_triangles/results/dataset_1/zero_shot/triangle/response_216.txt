Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 1, 2>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 2, 1>, <5, 7, 6>, <9, 4, 2>]
Therefore, the final answer is [10].
