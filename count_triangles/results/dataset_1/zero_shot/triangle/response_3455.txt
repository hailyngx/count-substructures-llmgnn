Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<5, 7, 6>
<6, 8, 9>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
