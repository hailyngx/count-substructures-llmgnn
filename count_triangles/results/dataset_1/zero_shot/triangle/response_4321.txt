Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The list of triangles found in the given graph are: 
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <4, 3, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, <6, 7, 8>
Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
