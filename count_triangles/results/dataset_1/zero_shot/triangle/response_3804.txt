Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   0 -- 1 -- 2 
   |         |
   9 -- 5 -- 6
    \       /
      4 -- 3
         |
         8
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 9.  
So, the final answer is [9].
