Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [ <0, 2, 4>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 7, 9> ] unique triangles in the given graph.
