Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [15] triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<0, 7, 1>
<4, 3, 9>
<2, 8, 4>
<2, 9, 3>
<7, 0, 1>
<1, 7, 0> 

So, the final answer is [15].
