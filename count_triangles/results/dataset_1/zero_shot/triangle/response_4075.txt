Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 11 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 1, 0>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 9, 5>, <4, 9, 5>, <5, 7, 3>, <5, 8, 3>, <5, 9, 4>, <5, 9, 4>.

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
