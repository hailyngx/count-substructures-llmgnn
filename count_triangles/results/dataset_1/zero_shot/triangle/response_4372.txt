Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<0, 8, 9> 

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
