Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 18 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 8, 3>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 9, 2>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 4>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 4>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
The total number of triangles is [18].
