Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of unique triangles in this graph can be found by calculating the triangles using the adjacency matrix based method as there are no cliques present in the graph. 

Upon calculation, there are 4 unique triangles in the given graph: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, and <1, 3, 7>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
