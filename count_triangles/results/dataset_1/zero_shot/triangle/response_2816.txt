Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in the graph. Here they are:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 0, 2>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 4, 2>
<2, 4, 8>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<8, 6, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [10].
