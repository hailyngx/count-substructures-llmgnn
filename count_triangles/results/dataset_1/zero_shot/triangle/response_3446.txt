Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are:
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<0, 8, 4>
<1, 8, 7> 

Therefore, the final answer is: [10].
