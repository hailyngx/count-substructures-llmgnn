Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph contains some triangles where each node is connected to two other nodes forming a triangle. Let's identify the triangles present in this graph.

Triangles:
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 2>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 8, 1>
<2, 3, 2>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 1>
<2, 7, 0>
<2, 7, 0>
<3, 0, 5>
<5, 0, 9>
<6, 1, 8>
<6, 1, 2>
<6, 2, 3>
<6, 2, 7>
<6, 4, 6>
<7, 0, 5>
<7, 2, 9>
<9, 5, 0>

There are 20 triangles in total. Therefore, the number of triangles in this graph is [20].
