Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 7, 5>
<2, 9, 3>
<2, 9, 5>
<3, 8, 0>
<3, 8, 9>
<3, 9, 2>
<4, 9, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of 13 triangles in this graph. So, the final answer is [13].
