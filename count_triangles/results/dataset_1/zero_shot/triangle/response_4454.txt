Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The list of unique triangles in the given graph is as follows: <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 8>.
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
