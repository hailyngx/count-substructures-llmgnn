Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
