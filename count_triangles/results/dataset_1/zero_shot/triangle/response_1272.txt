Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles:
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
