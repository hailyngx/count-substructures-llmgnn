Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
    0 -- 1
    |    | \
    |    |  4
    |    | /|
    5 -- 2--7--9
         | \/|
         | /\|
         8 --3
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will identify the unique triangles present:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 7, 2>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 2>
4. Triangle <1, 7, 2>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 7>
6. Triangle <2, 8, 7>
7. Triangle <3, 8, 9>
8. Triangle <4, 7, 1>
9. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
10. Triangle <7, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
