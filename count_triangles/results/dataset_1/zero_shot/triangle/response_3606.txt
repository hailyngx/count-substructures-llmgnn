Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are: 

<0, 1, 4>
<1, 4, 9>
<5, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<6, 3, 5>
<6, 3, 4>
<6, 8, 1>
<8, 0, 4>
<0, 1, 8>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. 

The final answer is [10].
