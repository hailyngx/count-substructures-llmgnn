Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [32] edges in the graph. Now, let's count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
5. Triangle <5, 4, 8>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph <0, 1, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <5, 4, 8>.
