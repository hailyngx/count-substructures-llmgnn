Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <6, 7, 8>.
