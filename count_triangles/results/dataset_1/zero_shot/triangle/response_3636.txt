Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by each set of three nodes that are connected by edges. 
After examining the graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<3, 1, 6>
<3, 1, 8>
<3, 2, 4>
<3, 2, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 2, 8>
<4, 3, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 5>
