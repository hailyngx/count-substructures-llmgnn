Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 0, 2>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 0, 5>
<4, 8, 5>

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
