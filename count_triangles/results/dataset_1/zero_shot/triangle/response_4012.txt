Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<7, 5, 9>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
