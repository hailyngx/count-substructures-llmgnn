Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

[<2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <9, 0, 5>, <9, 3, 6>]
