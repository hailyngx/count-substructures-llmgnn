Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 2>
<2, 4, 1>
<3, 5, 0>
<3, 6, 9>
<7, 2, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
