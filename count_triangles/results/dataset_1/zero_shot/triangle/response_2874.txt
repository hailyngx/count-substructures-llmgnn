Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles present in this graph are:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 9, 5>
<1, 9, 2>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 5>
<5, 8, 4>
<6, 4, 7>
<6, 5, 9>
<6, 9, 7>
<7, 2, 9>
<8, 4, 5>
<9, 1, 2>
<9, 2, 7>
<9, 3, 0>

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
