Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in this graph. 

The triangles are:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<0, 2, 4>

So, the final answer is [9].
