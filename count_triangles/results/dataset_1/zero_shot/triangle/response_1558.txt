Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, <8, 9, 1>

Total number of triangles: [5]
