Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be found by summing up the number of triangles each node participates in and then dividing by 3 since each triangle is counted 3 times (once for each of its 3 vertices).

By examining the given graph, we can list the triangles that can be formed:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 8>

Counting the number of triangles each node participates in:
Node 0: 4 triangles
Node 2: 5 triangles
Node 3: 2 triangles
Node 4: 5 triangles
Node 5: 3 triangles
Node 6: 0 triangles
Node 7: 3 triangles
Node 8: 3 triangles

Summing the triangles each node participates in: 4 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 3 = 25
Dividing by 3 since each triangle is counted 3 times: 25 / 3 = 8.33

Hence, there are 8 unique triangles in the given graph in total. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
