Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, and <2, 6, 8> triangles in the given graph.  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
