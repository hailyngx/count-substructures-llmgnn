Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by nodes connected with edges.

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <5, 6, 9>

Hence, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
