Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
