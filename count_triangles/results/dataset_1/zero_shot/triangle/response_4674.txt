Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph, which can be described as follows: 

[<1, 2, 4>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 9, 2>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <1, 9, 7>]
