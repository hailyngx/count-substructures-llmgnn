Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <3, 1, 5>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 3, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <8, 0, 9>, <8, 3, 0>, <8, 3, 9>, <9, 0, 3>, <9, 3, 6>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
