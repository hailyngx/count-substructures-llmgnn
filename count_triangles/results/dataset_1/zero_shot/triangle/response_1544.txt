Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<5, 8, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
