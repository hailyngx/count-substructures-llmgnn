Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 15 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 2>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 2>
<3, 0, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 8, 5>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 2>
<7, 8, 1>
<8, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
