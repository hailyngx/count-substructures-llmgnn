Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangle is a graph concept that consists of three nodes connected such that each node is connected to the other two. Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

- Triangle 1: Nodes 1, 3, and 8 form a triangle.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1], and the unique triangle found is <1, 3, 8>.
