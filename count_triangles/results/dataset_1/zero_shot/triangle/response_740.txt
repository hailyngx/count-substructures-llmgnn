Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

[<1, 2, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 8, 5>, <2, 1, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 1, 8>, <8, 1, 2>, <8, 1, 5>, <8, 2, 1>]

There are 10 triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
