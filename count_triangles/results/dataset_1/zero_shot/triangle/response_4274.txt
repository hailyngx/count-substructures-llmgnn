Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
[<0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
