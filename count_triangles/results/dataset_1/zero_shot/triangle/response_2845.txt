Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by looking at all possible sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other. We can find the triangles in the provided graph by inspecting each possible triangle formed by the edges.

There are a total of 8 triangles in this graph. They can be described as follows:
<0, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
