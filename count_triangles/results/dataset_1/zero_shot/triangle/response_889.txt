Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the edges. 

Upon further analysis, the triangles in the graph are formed by the following node combinations: 
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
