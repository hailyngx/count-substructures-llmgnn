Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 2>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 8>

So the final answer is [5].
