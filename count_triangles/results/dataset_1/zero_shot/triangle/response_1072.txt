Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting all possible triangles formed by the nodes and edges.

After analyzing the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 8.

Now, counting the triangles:

1. Triangles formed with node 0: None
2. Triangles formed with node 1: <0, 2, 4> (Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 2, and nodes 2 and 4 are connected to each other)
3. Triangles formed with node 2: None
4. Triangles formed with node 3: None
5. Triangles formed with node 4: None
6. Triangles formed with node 5: None
7. Triangles formed with node 7: None
8. Triangles formed with node 8: None
9. Triangles formed with node 9: <0, 7, 9> (Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 0, and nodes 7 and 0 are connected to each other)

Total number of triangles = 2

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
