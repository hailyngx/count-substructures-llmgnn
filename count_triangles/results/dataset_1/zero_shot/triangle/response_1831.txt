Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 8> unique triangles in the given graph.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
