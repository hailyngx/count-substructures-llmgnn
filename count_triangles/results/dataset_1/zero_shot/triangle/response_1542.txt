Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
