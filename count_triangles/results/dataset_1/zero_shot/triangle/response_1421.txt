Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by finding all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 8, 5>
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8> 
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
