Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles a node participates in and adding them all together.

Now, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

- Node 0 does not form any triangle.
- Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 6.
- Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 6 forms a triangle with node 8.
- Node 7 forms a triangle with node 9.
- Node 8 does not form any triangle.
- Node 9 forms a triangle with node 0.

Adding these all together, we find a total of 9 triangles.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9]. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <7, 9, 0>.
