Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>,
<0, 1, 9>,
<0, 6, 2>,
<0, 6, 9>,
<1, 5, 9>,
<2, 4, 6>,
<2, 6, 9>,
<2, 7, 3>,
<2, 7, 9>,
<3, 7, 9>
Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
