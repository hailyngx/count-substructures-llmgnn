Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles present in the given graph are:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 6, 3>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 9, 7>
<5, 8, 3>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
