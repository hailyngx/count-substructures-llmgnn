Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 22 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 8, 9>, <0, 9, 4>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 1, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 9, 6>, <5, 9, 7>, <6, 7, 9>]
