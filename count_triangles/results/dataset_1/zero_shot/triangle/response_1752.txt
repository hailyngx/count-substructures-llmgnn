Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. 

To count the number of triangles, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are pairwise connected. Let's list the triangles:

<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 8>

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in total.
