Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
