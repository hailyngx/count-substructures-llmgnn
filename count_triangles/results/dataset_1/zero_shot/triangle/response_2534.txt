Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:  
<0, 8, 4>  
<0, 8, 6>  
<0, 8, 9>  
<0, 6, 9>  
<1, 8, 3>  
<3, 8, 9>  
<4, 8, 9>  
<6, 8, 9>  

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total.  
The final answer is [8].
