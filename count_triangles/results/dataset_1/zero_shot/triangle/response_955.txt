Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 0>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
