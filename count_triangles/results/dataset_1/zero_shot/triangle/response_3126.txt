Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 9, 5>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 7, 2>
<2, 6, 7>
These are all the triangles in the graph. There are [10] triangles in total.
