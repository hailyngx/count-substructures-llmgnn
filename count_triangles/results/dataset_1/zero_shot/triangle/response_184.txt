Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 3, 9>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 9, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
