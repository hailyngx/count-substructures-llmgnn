Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 7, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 4, 1>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 6>, <3, 2, 9>, <3, 2, 0>, <4, 1, 6>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, <7, 8, 0>, <7, 8, 3>, <7, 3, 2>, <7, 3, 4>, <5, 0, 7>, <5, 0, 4>, <5, 4, 1>, <5, 4, 7>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 1, 5>, <6, 5, 0>, <6, 5, 7>
Count of triangles: [23]
