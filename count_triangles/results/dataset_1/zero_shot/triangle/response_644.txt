Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of unique triplets of nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 3>
<2, 3, 7>
<7, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
