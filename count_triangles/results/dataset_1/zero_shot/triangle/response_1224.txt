Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are fully connected.

The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 7, 9>
