Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 9, 7>
<1, 6, 1>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 3>
<3, 9, 0>
<3, 9, 2>
<3, 9, 7>
<3, 9, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
