Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are total of 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 5, 2>
<9, 6, 1>
<9, 6, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
