Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is: [4]

The unique triangles are: <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <0, 6, 4>.
