Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

\[<0, 1, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>\]

Therefore, there are \[ [4] \] triangles in total.
