Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining all possible sets of three nodes that are pairwise connected. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 2>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 4.  
The final answer is [4].
