Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
    0 --- 2
   /|     |\
  / |     | \
 6--3-----7--8
  \ |     | /
   \|     |/
    5-----4
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. The triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
