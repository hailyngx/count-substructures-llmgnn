Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<7, 3, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<1, 6, 4>
<8, 1, 4>
<9, 1, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
