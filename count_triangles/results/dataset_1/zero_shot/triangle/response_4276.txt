Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the triangles formed by every set of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two. 

By analyzing the given edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 1>
4. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
5. Triangle <0, 8, 1>
6. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
7. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
8. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
9. Triangle <2, 7, 3>
10. Triangle <2, 7, 4>
11. Triangle <2, 8, 1>
12. Triangle <2, 8, 5>
13. Triangle <2, 9, 8>
14. Triangle <3, 4, 6>
15. Triangle <3, 7, 4>
16. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
17. Triangle <6, 7, 3>
18. Triangle <7, 4, 8>
19. Triangle <8, 5, 1>
20. Triangle <8, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 20. 

Therefore, the answer is [20].
