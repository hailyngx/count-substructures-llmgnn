Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
0 -- 1 -- 2
|         |
5         3
|
1
|
8 -- 7 -- 9
|         |
5         4
|
6
```

In this graph, there are 4 triangles present. Here are the unique triangles:
<1, 0, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<7, 9, 4>
<1, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
