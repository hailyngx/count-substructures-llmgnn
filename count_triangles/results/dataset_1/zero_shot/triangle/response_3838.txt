Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of all the unique triangles:
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 2, 5>
<2, 0, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 2, 7>
<7, 2, 8>
<8, 4, 9>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
