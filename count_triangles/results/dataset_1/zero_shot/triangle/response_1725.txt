Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of and then dividing that count by 3 (since each triangle involves 3 nodes).

By examining the graph:
- Node 0 is part of 0 triangles.
- Node 2 is part of 2 triangles: <0, 2, 8> and <2, 4, 8>.
- Node 3 is part of 1 triangle: <3, 4, 8>.
- Node 4 is part of 1 triangle: <3, 4, 8>.
- Node 5 is part of 0 triangles.
- Node 6 is part of 0 triangles.
- Node 7 is part of 1 triangle: <3, 7, 8>.
- Node 8 is part of 6 triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 8, 3>, <4, 8, 7>, <7, 8, 3>, <7, 8, 4>.
- Node 9 is part of 0 triangles.

Adding up the counts, we get:
2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 = 11 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
