Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
