Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the edges in the graph. 

After examining the graph given, the following unique triangles were found:
<1, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
