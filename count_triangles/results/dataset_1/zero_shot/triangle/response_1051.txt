Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=0}^{n} d_i(d_i-1)(d_i-2), \]
where \( n \) is the total number of nodes and \( d_i \) is the degree of node \( i \).

Given the graph with 10 nodes and the specified edges, the degrees of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 4

Calculating the number of triangles using the formula:
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} [4(3)(2) + 3(2)(1) + 4(3)(2) + 4(3)(2) + 4(3)(2) + 1(0)(-1) + 4(3)(2) + 3(2)(1) + 6(5)(4) + 4(3)(2)] = 18. \]

Hence, there are 18 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles listed inside brackets []:
\[ <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 8, 4>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 8, 4>, <2, 0, 7>, <2, 0, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 2>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 3>, <6, 7, 0>, <6, 8, 0>, <8, 9, 3> \]
The final answer is:
\[ [18] \]
