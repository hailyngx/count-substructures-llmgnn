Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
