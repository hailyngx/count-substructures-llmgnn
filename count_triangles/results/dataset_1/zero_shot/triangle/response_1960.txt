Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 6>  
<1, 8, 5>  
<1, 9, 6>  

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the graph.
