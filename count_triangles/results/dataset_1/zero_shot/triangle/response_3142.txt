Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
