Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found: <1, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, and <3, 4, 6>. Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [3].
