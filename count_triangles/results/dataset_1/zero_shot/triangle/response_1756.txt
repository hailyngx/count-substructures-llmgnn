Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 7, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
