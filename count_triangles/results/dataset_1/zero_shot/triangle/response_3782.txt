Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 21 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 4>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 7, 4>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 9, 4>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <7, 4, 9>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [21].
