Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles formed by each set of three nodes. Here is the list of unique triangles found in the given graph along with their node numbers:

<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<5, 2, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
