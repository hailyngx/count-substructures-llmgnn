Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 8>.
