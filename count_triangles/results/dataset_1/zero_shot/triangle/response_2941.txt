Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 1>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 7, 6>

There are a total of [6] triangles in this graph.
