Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph.  

The triangles are:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
