Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:

<0, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 4>
<4, 5, 0>
<3, 7, 4>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
