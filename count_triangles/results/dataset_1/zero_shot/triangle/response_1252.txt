Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{degree}(v_i)(\text{degree}(v_i) - 1)(\text{degree}(v_i) - 2) \]
where \( \text{degree}(v_i) \) represents the degree of node \( v_i \). Let's calculate the number of triangles with this formula.

Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 8
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3

Now we substitute these values into the formula:
\[ \text{triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \left(3 \cdot (3-1) \cdot (3-2) + 4 \cdot (4-1) \cdot (4-2) + 4 \cdot (4-1) \cdot (4-2) + 8 \cdot (8-1) \cdot (8-2) + 2 \cdot (2-1) \cdot (2-2) + 3 \cdot (3-1) \cdot (3-2) + 4 \cdot (4-1) \cdot (4-2) + 2 \cdot (2-1) \cdot (2-2) + 3 \cdot (3-1) \cdot (3-2) + 3 \cdot (3-1) \cdot (3-2) \right) \]
\[ \text{triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \left( 6 + 12 + 12 + 168 + 0 + 6 + 24 + 0 + 6 + 6 \right) \]
\[ \text{triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 234 \]
\[ \text{triangles} = 39 \]

There are a total of 39 triangles in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [39] <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <8, 9, 0>
