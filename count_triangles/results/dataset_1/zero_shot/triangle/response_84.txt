Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are <0, 6, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, and <6, 7, 9>.
