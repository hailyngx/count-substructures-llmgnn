Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 8, 2>
<2, 6, 0>
<4, 9, 5>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 2>
<6, 9, 5>
<6, 9, 4> 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
