Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by identifying unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 3: <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle 4: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 3, 4>
- Triangle 6: <3, 4, 5>

By counting the total number of unique triangles, we find that there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
