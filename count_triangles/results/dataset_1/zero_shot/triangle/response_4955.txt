Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph. 

[6]

The unique triangles found are: <1, 3, 2>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 9, 8>, <3, 2, 1>.
