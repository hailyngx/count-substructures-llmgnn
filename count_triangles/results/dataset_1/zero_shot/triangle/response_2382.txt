Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: 

<0, 2, 6>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 8, 7>
<1, 9, 3>
<2, 7, 4>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 5>
<1, 6, 0>
<4, 1, 5>
<7, 8, 0>

There are 12 unique triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [12].
