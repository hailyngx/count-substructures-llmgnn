Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [6].
