Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of closed loops of length 3. Let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 4>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 5>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
