Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all unique paths of length 2 between nodes. Since a triangle forms when three nodes are connected to each other in a closed loop, the triangles can be identified by finding unique sets of three nodes that have edges connecting each pair.

Calculating the number of triangles in the graph:
[15]

List of unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 9, 0>, <1, 9, 2>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 7, 3>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <6, 0, 8>, <7, 3, 5>, <8, 6, 0> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
