Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are:
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 7, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
