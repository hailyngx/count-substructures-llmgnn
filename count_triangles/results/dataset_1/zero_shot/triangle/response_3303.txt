Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 8, 7>
<3, 9, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
