Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by identifying the set of unique triangles based on the given edges. 

After carefully examining the graph based on the provided edges, the following unique triangles are found:
<1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 9, 2>, <5, 8, 1>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
