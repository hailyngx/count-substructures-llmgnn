Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:

<0, 3, 6>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
