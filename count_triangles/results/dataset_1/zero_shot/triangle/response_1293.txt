Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 4, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 5>
<6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
