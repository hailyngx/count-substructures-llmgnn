Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
