Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 5>, and <0, 6, 7>.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the graph.
