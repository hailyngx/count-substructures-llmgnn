Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=0}^{n} d_i(d_i-1)(d_i-2) \]
where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the graph, and \( d_i \) is the degree of node \( i \).

Let's calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{6} [(4)(3)(2) + (3)(2)(4) + (4)(3)(2) + (2)(1)(2) + (4)(3)(4) + (1)(0)(2) + (2)(1)(4) + (4)(3)(4) + (4)(3)(5) + (5)(4)(5)] \]

Adding these together, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{6} [24 + 24 + 24 + 4 + 48 + 0 + 8 + 48 + 60 + 100] = \frac{340}{6} = 56.67 \]

Since the number of triangles must be an integer, we conclude that there are 57 triangles in this graph.

Therefore, the answer is: [57]
