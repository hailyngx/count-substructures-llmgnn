Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 4.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 9>

So, the final answer is [4].
