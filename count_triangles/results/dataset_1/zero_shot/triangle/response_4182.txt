Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<3, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 7, 2>, <3, 7, 6>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 3>, <5, 1, 9>, <6, 0, 8> 

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
