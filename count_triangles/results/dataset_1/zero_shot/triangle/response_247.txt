Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges.

The graph formed by the given edges is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 9), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 9), (7, 0), (7, 4), (9, 2), (9, 5)

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle 2: <1, 4, 5>
- Triangle 3: <2, 3, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is 3. 
Therefore, the answer is [3].
