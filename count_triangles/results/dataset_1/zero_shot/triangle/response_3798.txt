Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 4, 5>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
