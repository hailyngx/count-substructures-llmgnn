Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 8>  

Count of triangles: [6]
