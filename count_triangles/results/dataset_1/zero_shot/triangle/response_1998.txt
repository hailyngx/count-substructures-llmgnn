Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 0, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 0, 6>, <2, 6, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 1, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <7, 1, 4>, <7, 4, 6>, <7, 6, 5>, <7, 5, 9>, <8, 3, 4>, <9, 0, 6>, <9, 6, 5>, <9, 5, 7>
