Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 4>
<6, 7, 1>
<6, 7, 9>

There are 11 triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [11].
