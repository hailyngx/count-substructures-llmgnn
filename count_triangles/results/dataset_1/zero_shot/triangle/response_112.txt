Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 3, 0>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 6>, <4, 7, 6>

[ There are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph. ]
