Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by looking at the number of connected triples of nodes. In this case, we can count the triangles by examining each node and the connections it has with other nodes.

Upon investigation, the triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 6, 7>, <5, 4, 8>, <7, 8, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
