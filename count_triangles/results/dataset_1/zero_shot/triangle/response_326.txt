Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three connected nodes.

Counting the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle 3: <1, 3, 9>
- Triangle 4: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 5: <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle 6: <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle 7: <4, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [7]
