Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph consists of 10 nodes and 32 edges. Let's find the number of triangles present in this graph.

Observing the graph, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
