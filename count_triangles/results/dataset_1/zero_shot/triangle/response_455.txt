Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the unique sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected. 

By examining the graph carefully, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 6>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
