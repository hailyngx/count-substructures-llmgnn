Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be determined by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of. Let's calculate that:

- Node 1 is a part of 2 triangles: <1, 5, 8> and <1, 6, 9>
- Node 2 is a part of 0 triangles
- Node 4 is a part of 0 triangles
- Node 5 is a part of 1 triangle: <1, 5, 8>
- Node 6 is a part of 2 triangles: <1, 6, 9> and <5, 6, 8>
- Node 7 is a part of 0 triangles
- Node 8 is a part of 2 triangles: <1, 5, 8> and <1, 6, 9>
- Node 9 is a part of 1 triangle: <1, 6, 9>

Now, let's calculate the number of unique triangles:

- <1, 5, 8>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
