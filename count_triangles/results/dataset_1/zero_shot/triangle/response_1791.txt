Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
