Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [9] triangles in the given graph, and they are: <2, 1, 4>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 1, 4>, <3, 1, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>.
