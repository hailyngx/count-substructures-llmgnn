Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by identifying all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the number of triangles:

The triangles present in the graph are as follows:

<0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <7, 4, 9>, <7, 6, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
