Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each possible combination of three nodes.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 8, 7>
<2, 8, 7>
<2, 9, 7>
<2, 9, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 2>
<4, 5, 2>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 9, 2>
<4, 9, 2>
<5, 8, 1>
<5, 8, 1>
<5, 8, 7>
<5, 8, 7>
<5, 8, 1>
<5, 8, 1>
<5, 8, 7>
<5, 8, 7>
<5, 4, 9>
<5, 4, 9>
<9, 7, 2>
<9, 7, 2>

Therefore, there are 28 triangles in the given graph. The answer is [28].
