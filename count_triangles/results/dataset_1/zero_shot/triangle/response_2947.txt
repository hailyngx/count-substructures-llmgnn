Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 8, 6>
<3, 9, 5> 

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
