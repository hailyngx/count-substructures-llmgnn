Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
\[<0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 8>\]

Therefore, the answer is [10].
