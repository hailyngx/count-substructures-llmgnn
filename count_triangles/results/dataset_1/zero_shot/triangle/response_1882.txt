Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 0, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 4>  (This is a loop edge: 5->4->5)
<9, 6, 1>

There are total of 6 unique triangles in the graph. So, the final answer is [6].
