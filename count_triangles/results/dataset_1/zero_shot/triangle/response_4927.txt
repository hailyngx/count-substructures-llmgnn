Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are <1, 3, 2>, <1, 6, 3>, and <5, 8, 9>. 
There are [3] triangles in total.
