Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] unique triangles in this graph.

The unique triangles are:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 1>
<7, 6, 1>
<8, 9, 5> 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
