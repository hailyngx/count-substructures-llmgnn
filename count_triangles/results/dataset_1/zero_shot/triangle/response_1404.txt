Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 17 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:

<2, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<8, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 9, 2>
<8, 1, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<7, 6, 8>
<6, 3, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 0>
<0, 7, 8>

Thus, the final answer is [17].
