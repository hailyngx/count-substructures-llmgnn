Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:  
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i} deg(v_i) \times (deg(v_i) - 1) \times (deg(v_i) - 2) \]
where \( deg(v_i) \) is the degree of node \( v_i \).

Given the degrees of the nodes in the graph are:  
- deg(0) = 2
- deg(1) = 4
- deg(2) = 3
- deg(3) = 5
- deg(4) = 5
- deg(5) = 8
- deg(6) = 3
- deg(7) = 3
- deg(8) = 5
- deg(9) = 4

Now we can substitute the values into the formula to find the number of triangles.  
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \left(2 \times 1 \times 0 + 4 \times 3 \times 2 + 3 \times 2 \times 1 + 5 \times 4 \times 3 + 5 \times 4 \times 3 + 8 \times 7 \times 6 + 3 \times 2 \times 1 + 3 \times 2 \times 1 + 5 \times 4 \times 3 + 4 \times 3 \times 2\right) \]

Calculating the sum:  
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \times 0 + 24 + 6 + 60 + 60 + 336 + 6 + 6 + 60 + 24 = 572\]

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is 572.

The unique triangles are as follows:  
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <5, 4, 9>, <6, 3, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <7, 4, 5>, <8, 4, 5>, <8, 5, 6>, <8, 5, 9>, <8, 4, 9>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [572].
