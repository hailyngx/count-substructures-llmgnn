Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. 

The triangles in this graph are as follows: 
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 4>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 8, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [8] triangles in this graph.
