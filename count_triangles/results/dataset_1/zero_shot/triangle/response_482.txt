Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated based on the number of connected triples of nodes, where each node is connected to the other two nodes. 

In this case, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
4. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
5. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
7. Triangle <1, 2, 9>
8. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
9. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
10. Triangle <2, 4, 7>
11. Triangle <4, 5, 9>

There are a total of 11 triangles found, therefore the answer is [11].
