Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. We can use the given information on the graph to count the number of triangles.

By examining the edges given in the graph, we can find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
