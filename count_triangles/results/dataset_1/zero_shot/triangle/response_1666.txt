Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed within brackets:

[<0, 2, 4> <1, 2, 5> <2, 3, 9> <2, 5, 7> <3, 4, 9> <2, 7, 9>]
