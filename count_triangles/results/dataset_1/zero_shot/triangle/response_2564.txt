Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 6, 3>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 0>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 0, 4>, <3, 4, 0>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 6, 0>, <4, 0, 6>, <5, 1, 3>, <6, 0, 4>, <6, 3, 1>, <6, 7, 5>, <7, 5, 1>

There are 17 unique triangles in total, so the final answer is [17].
