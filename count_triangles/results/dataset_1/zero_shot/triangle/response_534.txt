Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 0>, <1, 4, 6>, <6, 5, 7>. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
