Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in the graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:
[<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 1, 8>, <5, 4, 8>, <6, 4, 7>, <8, 0, 9>, <9, 2, 3>]
