Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by looking for unique cycles of length 3. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 5>, <2, 0, 4>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 1, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>]

There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
