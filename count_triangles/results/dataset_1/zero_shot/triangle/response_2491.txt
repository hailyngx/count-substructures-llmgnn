Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by looking at each node and checking for triangles it forms with its neighboring nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. 

After analyzing the graph, the triangles found are as follows:
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 8, 0>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 3>
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 0>
<4, 3, 9>
<6, 0, 7>
<7, 0, 6>
<7, 2, 3>
<7, 3, 6>
<8, 0, 9>
<9, 0, 3>
<9, 0, 4>
<9, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [23].
