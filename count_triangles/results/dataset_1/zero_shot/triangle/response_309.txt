Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for the triangles formed by nodes connected to each other. 

Let's find the triangles in the given graph:
1. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
3. Triangle <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. The answer is [3].
