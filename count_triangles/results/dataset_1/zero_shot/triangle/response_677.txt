Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets []:

[<0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 9, 6>, <2, 3, 0>]
