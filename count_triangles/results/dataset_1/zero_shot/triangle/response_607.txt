Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 9, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 0>
<3, 6, 4>
<3, 7, 0>
<3, 7, 6>
<3, 8, 1>
<3, 8, 5>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 9, 6>
<9, 0, 6>

There are 15 triangles in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
