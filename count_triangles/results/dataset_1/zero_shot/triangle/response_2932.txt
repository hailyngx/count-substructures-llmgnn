Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles:
<1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 8> 

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
