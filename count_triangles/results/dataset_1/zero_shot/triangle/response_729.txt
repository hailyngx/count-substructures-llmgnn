Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are **8 triangles** in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles found:

\[<0, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>\] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is **8** [8].
