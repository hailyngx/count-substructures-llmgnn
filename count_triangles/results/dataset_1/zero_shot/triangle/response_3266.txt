Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
