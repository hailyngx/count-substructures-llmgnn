Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by finding all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

After examining the given graph, the triangles found are:
1. <2, 4, 9>
2. <4, 5, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
