Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<3, 5, 4>, <3, 9, 5>, <3, 9, 7>, <9, 2, 8>, <3, 6, 4>, <9, 7, 6>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
