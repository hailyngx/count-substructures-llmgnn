Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [15] and the unique triangles are <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <6, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <0, 8, 9>.
