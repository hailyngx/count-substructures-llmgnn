Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<7, 9, 4>

Total number of triangles: 8
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
