Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Counting the number of triangles in the given graph:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
