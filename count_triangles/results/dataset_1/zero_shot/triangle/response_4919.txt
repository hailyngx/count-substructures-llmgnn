Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 9>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 9, 1>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 4, 3>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 9>.
