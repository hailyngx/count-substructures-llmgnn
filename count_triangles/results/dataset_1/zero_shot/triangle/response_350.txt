Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by checking each possible set of 3 nodes to see if they form a triangle. 
Upon examining the graph provided, the following unique triangles were identified:
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
