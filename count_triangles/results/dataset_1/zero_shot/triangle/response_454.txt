Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 triangles in this graph. Here they are listed with their nodes:

\[<0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <8, 9, 7>\]

Therefore, the answer is [12].
