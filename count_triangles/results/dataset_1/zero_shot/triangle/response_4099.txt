Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the graph. The triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 0, 3>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 1, 3>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
