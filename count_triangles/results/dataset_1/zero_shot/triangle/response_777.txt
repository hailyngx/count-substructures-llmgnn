Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
