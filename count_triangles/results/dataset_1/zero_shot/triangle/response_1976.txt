Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<8, 6, 1>
<8, 9, 0>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
