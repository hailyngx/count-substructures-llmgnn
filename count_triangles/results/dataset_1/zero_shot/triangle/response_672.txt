Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by checking each combination of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Let's list the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
