Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:

<1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 4>, <2, 8, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
