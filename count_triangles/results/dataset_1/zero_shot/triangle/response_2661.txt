Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

From the given edge list, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 9, 1>
<0, 9, 7>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<9, 1, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
