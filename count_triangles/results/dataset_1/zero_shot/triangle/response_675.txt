Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the unique combinations of three nodes that form a triangle. 

Upon careful analysis, the unique triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
