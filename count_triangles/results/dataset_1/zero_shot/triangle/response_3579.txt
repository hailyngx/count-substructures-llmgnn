Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

```
   1 --- 3 --- 7 --- 2
  /|    / \    |\   |
 0 |   4 - 5    \  8
  \|            /|/
   6 --- 7 --- 3
```

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we analyze the triangles formed by every set of three vertices. The triangles in this graph are:
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 8, 1>
- <2, 7, 3>
- <3, 7, 6>
- <7, 6, 0>
- <1, 8, 3>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [10].
