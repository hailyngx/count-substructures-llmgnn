Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other by edges.

By examining the provided edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <5, 4, 8>
- <6, 8, 9>

Hence, the number of triangles present in the given graph is [8].
