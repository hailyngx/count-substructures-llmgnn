Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 5>, <2, 0, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 3, 5>, <6, 5, 7>, <7, 2, 5>, <7, 5, 8>, <7, 6, 1>, <7, 6, 5>, <9, 0, 4>, <9, 1, 4>  
Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.  
Thus, the final answer is [16].
