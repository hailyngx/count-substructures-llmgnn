Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 6>
<8, 9, 5>

So, the final answer is [5].
