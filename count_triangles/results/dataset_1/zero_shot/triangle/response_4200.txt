Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<1, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
