Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 2>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <7, 6, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
