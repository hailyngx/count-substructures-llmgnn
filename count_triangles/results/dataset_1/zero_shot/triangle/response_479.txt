Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<5, 8, 7>
<5, 8, 1>

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the graph.
