Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph with the given edges can be represented as follows:

```
    0 -- 4      1 -- 8
    |    |     /|   /|
    |    |    / |  / |
    9    7   9  4 2  6
     \  /     \ |  \ |
      7         1 -- 8 
                 |    |
                 7    5
```

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

After examining the graph, we can find the following unique triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 2>
<7, 5, 7>
<8, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
