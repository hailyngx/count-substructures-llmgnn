Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be found by looking for cycles of length 3. Here are the triangles present in the graph:

<1, 0, 2>
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 3>
<1, 7, 6>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 0, 4>
<6, 3, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 3, 8>
<8, 6, 9>

There are [12] triangles in total.
