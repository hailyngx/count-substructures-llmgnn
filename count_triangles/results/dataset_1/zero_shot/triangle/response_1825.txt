Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: <3, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>.
    Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
