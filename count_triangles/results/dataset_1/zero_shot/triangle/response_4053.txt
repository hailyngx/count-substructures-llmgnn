Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 6.  

The unique triangles are:  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 6, 7>  
<0, 7, 5>  
<0, 8, 9>  
<2, 9, 8>  
<7, 4, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
