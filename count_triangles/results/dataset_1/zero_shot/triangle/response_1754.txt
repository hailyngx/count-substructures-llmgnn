Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 3), (0, 7), (1, 6), (1, 8), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 9), (7, 8), (8, 9)

With 10 nodes, we can form triangles using combinations of nodes. Let's count the number of triangles present in the graph:

Triangles:
<0, 3, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 1>

There are 3 triangles in total. Thus, the answer is [3].
