Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
[<0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>]
