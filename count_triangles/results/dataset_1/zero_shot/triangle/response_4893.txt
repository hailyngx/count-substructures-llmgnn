Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles: 

<0, 2, 5>
<1, 7, 9>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the graph.
