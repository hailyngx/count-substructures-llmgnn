Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 1>, <6, 7, 5>

There are a total of 9 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
