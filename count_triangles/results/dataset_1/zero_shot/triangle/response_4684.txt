Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be visualized as follows:

- Triangle 1: nodes (0, 2, 4)
- Triangle 2: nodes (2, 4, 8)
- Triangle 3: nodes (3, 1, 9)
- Triangle 4: nodes (4, 6, 8)

Total number of triangles: 4

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
