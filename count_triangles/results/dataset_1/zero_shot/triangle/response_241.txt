Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 18 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found within the graph:

<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 7, 3>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 5>
<6, 7, 0>
<6, 7, 3>
<0, 8, 5>
<1, 6, 4>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 8, 5>
<4, 6, 7>
<0, 7, 6>
<2, 1, 6>
<5, 3, 7>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
