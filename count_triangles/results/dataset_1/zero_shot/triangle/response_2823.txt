Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges.

Let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

  - Nodes 3, 4, and 5 form a triangle <0, 3, 4>
  - Nodes 3, 5, and 8 form a triangle <0, 3, 5>

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7
  - Nodes 3, 5, and 7 form a triangle <1, 3, 5>

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 7
  - Nodes 3, 4, and 5 form a triangle <2, 3, 4>
  - Nodes 3, 5, and 7 form a triangle <2, 3, 5>
  - Nodes 4, 5, and 2 form a triangle <2, 4, 5>
  - Nodes 5, 7, and 2 form a triangle <2, 5, 7>

- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 8
  - Nodes 0, 1, and 3 form a triangle <0, 1, 3>
  - Nodes 0, 2, and 3 form a triangle <0, 2, 3>
  - Nodes 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle <1, 2, 3>
  - Nodes 2, 7, and 3 form a triangle <2, 7, 3>
  - Nodes 3, 5, and 7 form a triangle <3, 5, 7>
  - Nodes 3, 8, and 0 form a triangle <0, 3, 8>

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5
  - Nodes 0, 2, and 4 form a triangle <0, 2, 4>
  - Nodes 2, 4, and 5 form a triangle <2, 4, 5>

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8
  - Nodes 0, 1, and 5 form a triangle <0, 1, 5>
  - Nodes 0, 2, and 5 form a triangle <0, 2, 5>
  - Nodes 2, 4, and 5 form a triangle <2, 4, 5>
  - Nodes 3, 5, and 7 form a triangle <3, 5, 7>
  - Nodes 5, 8, and 0 form a triangle <0, 5, 8>

- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9
  - Nodes 1, 2, and 7 form a triangle <1, 2, 7>
  - Nodes 2, 7, and 3 form a triangle <2, 7, 3>
  - Nodes 3, 5, and 7 form a triangle <3, 5, 7>
  - Nodes 7, 8, and 0 form a triangle <0, 7, 8>

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7
  - Nodes 0, 3, and 8 form a triangle <0, 3, 8>
  - Nodes 3, 5, and 7 form a triangle <3, 5, 7>
  - Nodes 5, 8, and 0 form a triangle <0, 5, 8>
  - Nodes 7, 8, and 0 form a triangle <0, 7, 8>

- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 7
  (No triangles involving node 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 15.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 7, 3>.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
