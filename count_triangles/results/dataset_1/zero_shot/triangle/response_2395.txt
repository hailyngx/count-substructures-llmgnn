Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
[<0, 1, 2>, <1, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>]  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
