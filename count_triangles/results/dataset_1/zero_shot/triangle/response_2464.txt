Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
