Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph, and they are:

[<0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <6, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 1>, <8, 9, 0>]

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
