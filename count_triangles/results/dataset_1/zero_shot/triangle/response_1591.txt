Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i} [\text{degree of node i}]^2 - [\text{number of edges adjacent to node i}] \]

Let's calculate the number of triangles. 

For node 0: degree = 2, edges adjacent = 2
For node 1: degree = 4, edges adjacent = 4
For node 2: degree = 3, edges adjacent = 3
For node 3: degree = 4, edges adjacent = 4
For node 4: degree = 6, edges adjacent = 6
For node 5: degree = 4, edges adjacent = 4
For node 6: degree = 3, edges adjacent = 2
For node 7: degree = 4, edges adjacent = 4
For node 8: degree = 6, edges adjacent = 6
For node 9: degree = 2, edges adjacent = 2

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \left[ 2^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 2^2 \right] - \left[ 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 \right] \]
\[ = \frac{1}{6} \left[ 4 + 16 + 9 + 16 + 36 + 16 + 9 + 16 + 36 + 4 \right] - \left[ 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 \right] \]
\[ = \frac{1}{6} \times 146 - 43 \]
\[ = \frac{146}{6} - 43 \]
\[ = 24.33 - 43 \]
\[ = -18.67 \]

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is 0.

Hence, the final answer is: [0]
