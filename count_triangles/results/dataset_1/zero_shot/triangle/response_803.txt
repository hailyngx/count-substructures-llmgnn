Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here's the list of unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 0>
<5, 6, 2>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 3>
<7, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
