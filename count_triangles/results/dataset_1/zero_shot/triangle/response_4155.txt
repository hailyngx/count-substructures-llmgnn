Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 24 triangles in the given graph.
