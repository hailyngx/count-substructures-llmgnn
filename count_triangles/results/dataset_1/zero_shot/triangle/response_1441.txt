Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>.
