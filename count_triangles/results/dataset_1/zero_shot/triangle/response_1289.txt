Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by finding the number of closed loops of length 3. 

Based on the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
