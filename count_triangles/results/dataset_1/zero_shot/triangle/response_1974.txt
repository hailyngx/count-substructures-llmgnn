Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [9].
