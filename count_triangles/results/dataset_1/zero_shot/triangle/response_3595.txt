Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of paths of length 2 between all possible node pairs. Each triplet of nodes where each node is reachable from the other two forms a triangle. 

After analyzing the given graph, the unique triangles found are: <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
