Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
