Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

Let's consider each node individually to see if it forms a triangle with its neighbors.

- Node 0 has triangles with nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 1 has triangles with nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 3 has a triangle with node 5.
- Node 4 has a triangle with node 8.
- Node 5 has triangles with nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Node 6 does not form any triangles.
- Node 7 does not form any triangles.
- Node 8 does not form any triangles.
- Node 9 does not form any triangles.

Putting it all together, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5> <0, 3, 5> <1, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
