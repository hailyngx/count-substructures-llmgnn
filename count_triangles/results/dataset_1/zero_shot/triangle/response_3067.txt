Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles listed:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
