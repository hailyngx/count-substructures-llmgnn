Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, and <1, 6, 9>.
