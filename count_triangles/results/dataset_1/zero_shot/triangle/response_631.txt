Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are:
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 9, 1>
<2, 4, 2>
<2, 7, 6>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 2>
<8, 5, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
