Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in this graph.
