Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of paths of length 2 between nodes. Let's go ahead and find the triangles in this graph:

Triangles:
[<0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 9>]

There are 9 triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
