Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by finding the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. Let's calculate the number of triangles.

The triangles in this graph are formed by the following node combinations:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 9 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
