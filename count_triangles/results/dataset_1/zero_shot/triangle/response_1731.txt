Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<5, 4, 2>
<0, 6, 3>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
