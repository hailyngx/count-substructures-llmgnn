Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<0, 1, 9>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
