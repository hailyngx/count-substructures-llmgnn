Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph.
