Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 1>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<4, 5, 3>
<6, 0, 1>
<6, 0, 4>
<6, 1, 8>
<6, 8, 2>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
