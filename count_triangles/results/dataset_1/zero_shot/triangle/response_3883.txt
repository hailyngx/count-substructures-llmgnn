Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 4.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
