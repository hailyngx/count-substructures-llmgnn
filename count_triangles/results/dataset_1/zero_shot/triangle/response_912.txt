Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles:

[<0, 1, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <4, 3, 9>, <7, 5, 1>, <8, 2, 7>, <7, 8, 6>, <4, 9, 3>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
