Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 4, 9>
<6, 4, 6>
<6, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
