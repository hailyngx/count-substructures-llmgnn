Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 7>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 5>
<7, 9, 8>
<8, 9, 5> 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
