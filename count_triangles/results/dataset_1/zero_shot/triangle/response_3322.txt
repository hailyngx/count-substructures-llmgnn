Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 9>.
