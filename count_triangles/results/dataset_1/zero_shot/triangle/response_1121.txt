Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
