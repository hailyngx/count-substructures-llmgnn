Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are total of 12 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: 
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, , 4, 9>
<5, 0, 6>
<5, 0, 7>
<5, 1, 2>
<7, 0, 9>
<8, 6, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
