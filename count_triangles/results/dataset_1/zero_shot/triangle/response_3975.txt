Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the given graph.

[<2, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <6, 7, 8>, <0, 1, 7>, <4, 7, 6>, <4, 7, 9>]
