Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the graph:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 3>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
