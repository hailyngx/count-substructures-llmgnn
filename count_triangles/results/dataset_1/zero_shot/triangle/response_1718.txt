Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [18].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 2>
<4, 6, 5>
<5, 3, 9>
<5, 8, 3>
<6, 4, 0>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 9, 3>
<9, 0, 7>
<9, 0, 4>
<9, 3, 5>
<9, 3, 7>

Therefore, the answer is [18].
