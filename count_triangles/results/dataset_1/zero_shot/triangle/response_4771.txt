Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

<0, 1, 4>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 9, 2>
<6, 9, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
