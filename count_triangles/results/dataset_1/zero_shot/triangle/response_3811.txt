Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
    1 -- 0 -- 2 -- 5
    |         |    |
    6         3 -- 7 -- 9
             |    |
             4    8
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by three nodes connected by edges. 

The triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the graph.
