Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 6>
<3, 6, 9>

The number of triangles in the graph is [8].
