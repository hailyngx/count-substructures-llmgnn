Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

There are a total of 7 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
