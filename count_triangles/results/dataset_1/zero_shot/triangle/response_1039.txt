Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by analyzing each set of three nodes that are connected to each other. Here is the list of unique triangles found in the given graph:

<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

Count of triangles: [7]
