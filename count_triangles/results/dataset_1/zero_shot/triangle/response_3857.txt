Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 8>

There are [4] triangles in total.
