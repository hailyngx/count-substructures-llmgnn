Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 6. Here is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:

\[<0, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>\] 

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
