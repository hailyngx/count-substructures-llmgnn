Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The list of triangles in the given graph is as follows:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<9, 5, 7>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
