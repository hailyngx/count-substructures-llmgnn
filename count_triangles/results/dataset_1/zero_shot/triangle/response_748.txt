Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
  1 -- 3
 / \  
0 - 4 - 6
|   |  
8   9
|
7
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify the triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Upon examining the graph, we find the following unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
