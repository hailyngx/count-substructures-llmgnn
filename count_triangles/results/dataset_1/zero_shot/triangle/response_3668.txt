Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated based on the number of triangles a node can be a part of. Let's count the number of triangles:

- Node 0 can form triangles with nodes 1, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 can form triangles with nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 does not form any triangles due to the lack of appropriate connections.
- Node 3 does not form any triangles due to the lack of appropriate connections.
- Node 4 can form a triangle with nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 5 can form triangles with nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 6 can form triangles with nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 7 can form a triangle with node 8.
- Node 8 does not form any triangles due to the lack of appropriate connections.
- Node 9 does not form any triangles due to the lack of appropriate connections.

Combining these triangles, we have the following unique triangles in the graph: <0, 1, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, and <6, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
