Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the given edges. 

After examining the graph, the triangles formed are: 
<1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <5, 8, 9>

There are 10 unique triangles in total, which we can represent as:<1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <5, 8, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
