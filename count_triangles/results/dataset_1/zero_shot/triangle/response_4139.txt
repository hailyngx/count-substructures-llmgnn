Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>]
