Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be represented by the following combinations of nodes:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <8, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
