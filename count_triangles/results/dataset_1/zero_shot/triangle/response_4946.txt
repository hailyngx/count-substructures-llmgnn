Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is a part of and summing them up. Let's find all the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0 is a part of 0 triangles.
- Node 1 is a part of 2 triangles: <0, 1, 2> and <1, 4, 2>.
- Node 2 is a part of 2 triangles: <0, 1, 2> and <1, 4, 2>.
- Node 3 is a part of 0 triangles.
- Node 4 is a part of 1 triangle: <1, 4, 2>.
- Node 5 is a part of 0 triangles.
- Node 7 is a part of 0 triangles.
- Node 8 is a part of 0 triangle.
- Node 9 is a part of 0 triangle.

Counting up the number of triangles from each node, we have found a total of 5 unique triangles. Thus, the answer is [5].
