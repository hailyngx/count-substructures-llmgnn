Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

```
    1 -- 2
   /|    | \
  3 |    |  5
   \|    | /
    6 -- 4 -- 7
         |    |
         9 -- 8
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to find all the sets of three nodes that are fully connected. Let's list them:

1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 4, 6>
3. <1, 6, 9>
4. <2, 3, 5>
5. <4, 6, 9>
6. <4, 7, 8>
7. <6, 4, 9>
8. <8, 9, 7>

Since there are 8 unique triangles in the graph, the final answer is [8].
