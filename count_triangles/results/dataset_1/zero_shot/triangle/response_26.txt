Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is 4.
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, and <4, 5, 9>.
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
