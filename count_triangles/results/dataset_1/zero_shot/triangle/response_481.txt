Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 7>
Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
