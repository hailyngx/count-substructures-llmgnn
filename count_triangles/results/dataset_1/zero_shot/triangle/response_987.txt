Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There is a total of [10] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 3, 4>
<2, 9, 6>
<4, 8, 9>
<9, 6, 4> 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
