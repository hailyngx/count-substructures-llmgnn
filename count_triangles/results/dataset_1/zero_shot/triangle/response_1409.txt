Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
