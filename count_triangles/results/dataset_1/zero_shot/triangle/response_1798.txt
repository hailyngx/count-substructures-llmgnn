Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:  
\[ \frac{1}{6} \cdot \sum_{v \in V} (\text{deg}(v))^2 - \sum_{e \in E} (\text{deg}(v_1) + \text{deg}(v_2) + \text{deg}(v_3) - 6) \]

Where:  
\( V \) is the set of vertices  
\( E \) is the set of edges  
\( v_1, v_2, v_3 \) are vertices forming a triangle  

Given the graph with the provided edges, the number of triangles is 21. The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 4, 8>, <6, 8, 9>.  
  
Therefore, the final answer is [21].
