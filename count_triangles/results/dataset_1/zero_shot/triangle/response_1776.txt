Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 12. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 1, 7>
<4, 9, 5>
<5, 9, 6>
<6, 0, 3>
<9, 5, 0>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
