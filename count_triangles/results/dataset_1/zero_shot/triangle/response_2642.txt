Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 5>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
The total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
