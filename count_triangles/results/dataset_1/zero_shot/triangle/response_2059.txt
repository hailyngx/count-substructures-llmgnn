Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of possible triangles can be calculated by examining all possible combinations of 3 nodes connected by edges. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

[<2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 4>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
