Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
