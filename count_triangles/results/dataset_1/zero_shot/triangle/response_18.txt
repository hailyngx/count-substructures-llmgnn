Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [10].
