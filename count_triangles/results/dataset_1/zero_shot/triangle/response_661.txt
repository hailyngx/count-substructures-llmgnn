Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 2, 3>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
