Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the graph.
