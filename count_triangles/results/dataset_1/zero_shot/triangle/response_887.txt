Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 1, 8>
<3, 1, 6>
<3, 2, 5>
<4, 3, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 8, 1>
<5, 8, 7>
<7, 3, 1>
<9, 5, 0>
<9, 5, 4>
<9, 7, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
