Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by every set of three nodes connected by edges. 

After examining the given graph, we find the following triangles:
  - <0, 4, 2>
  - <0, 4, 5>
  - <0, 8, 6>
  - <1, 2, 4>
  - <1, 3, 5>
  - <3, 4, 5>
  - <3, 5, 8>
  - <6, 7, 8>
  - <6, 8, 0>
  - <7, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
