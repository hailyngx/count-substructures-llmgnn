Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
