Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

```
    1 --- 3
   /|    /|
  / |   / |
 0  |  7  |
 |  4---8 |  
 | /   | /
 |/    |/
 5 --- 6
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will list out all the triangles:

1. <0, 4, 1>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 8, 1>
4. <0, 5, 6>
5. <0, 5, 8>
6. <1, 4, 8>
7. <5, 6, 0>
8. <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total. 

The final answer is [8].
