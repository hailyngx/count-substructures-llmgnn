Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 2, 4>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 7>

There are a total of 5 triangles. Therefore, the answer is [5].
