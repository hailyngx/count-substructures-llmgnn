Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of 3 nodes that are connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles in the graph:

<0, 1, 4>
<3, 1, 8>

Hence, the number of triangles in the graph is 2. 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
