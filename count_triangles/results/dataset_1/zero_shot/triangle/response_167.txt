Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node participates in and then dividing by 6. Let's proceed with calculating the number of triangles in this graph.

Checking for each node:
- Node 0 participates in triangles with nodes 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 1 participates in triangles with nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 2 participates in triangles with nodes 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 participates in no triangles.
- Node 4 participates in triangles with nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 5 participates in triangles with nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 7 participates in triangles with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 8 participates in triangles with nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 9 participates in triangles with nodes 2 and 3.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
(3 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 2) / 6 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in this graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 4, 8> 

So, the answer is [6].
