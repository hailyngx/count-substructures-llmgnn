Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 8>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
