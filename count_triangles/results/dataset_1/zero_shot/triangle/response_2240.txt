Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be found by looking for triplets of nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 9, 5>
4. <0, 7, 9>
5. <0, 8, 2>
6. <1, 5, 7>
7. <4, 6, 7>
8. <5, 9, 0>
9. <6, 4, 7>
10. <6, 9, 5>
11. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [11].
