Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:

<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
