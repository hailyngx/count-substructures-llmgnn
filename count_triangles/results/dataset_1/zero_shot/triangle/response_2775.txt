Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 17 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [17].
