Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 9>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
