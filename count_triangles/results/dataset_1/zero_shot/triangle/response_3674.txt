Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 1>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <9, 7, 8>.
