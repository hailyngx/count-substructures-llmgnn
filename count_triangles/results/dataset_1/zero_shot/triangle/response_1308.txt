Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found: 
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
