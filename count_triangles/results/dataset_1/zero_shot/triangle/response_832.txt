Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 3.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
