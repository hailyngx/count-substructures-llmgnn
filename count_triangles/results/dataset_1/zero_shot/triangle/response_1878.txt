Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by every set of 3 connected nodes.

By observing the given edges, we can list the unique triangles that can be formed below:
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 7, 3>
<3, 4, 8>
<6, 0, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
