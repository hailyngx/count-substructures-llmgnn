Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 1, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 7, 9>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
