Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<5, 7, 8>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
