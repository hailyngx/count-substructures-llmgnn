Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
