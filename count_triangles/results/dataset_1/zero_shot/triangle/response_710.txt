Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles using the given edges. 

Upon examining the graph, we can find the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
