Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [9].
