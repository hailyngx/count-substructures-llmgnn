Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<2, 4, 1>
<6, 0, 7>
<6, 0, 9>
<6, 3, 9>
<3, 2, 4>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 2, 8>
<6, 2, 4>
<6, 8, 2>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
