Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<8, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
