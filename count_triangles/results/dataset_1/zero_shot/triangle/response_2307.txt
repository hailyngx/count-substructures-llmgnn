Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be found by looking for nodes that are connected in a way that forms a triangle. Here are the triangles found in this graph:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 8>

So, there are 4 triangles in total. Therefore, the answer is [4].
