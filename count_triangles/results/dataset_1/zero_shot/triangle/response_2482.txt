Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 3, 8>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
