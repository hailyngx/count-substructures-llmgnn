Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<7, 3, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<8, 3, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
