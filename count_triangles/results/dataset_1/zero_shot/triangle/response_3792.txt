Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles:

<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
