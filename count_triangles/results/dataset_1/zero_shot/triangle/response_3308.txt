Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 3>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 7, 3>, <1, 8, 7>, <1, 9, 6>, <1, 9, 8>, <3, 2, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <6, 8, 9>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
