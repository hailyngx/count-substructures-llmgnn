Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
In this graph, the triangles are formed by nodes that are connected to each other in a way that creates a closed loop with three edges. Let's identify the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <2, 0, 5>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <8, 1, 9>
5. Triangle <8, 4, 6>

Count of triangles: [5]
