Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: <2, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
