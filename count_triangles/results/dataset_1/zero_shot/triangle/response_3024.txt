Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

To count the triangles, we need to identify the sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 2>, <3, 9, 0>, <9, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
