Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are three triangles in the given graph. Here are the triangles listed within <>:

<0, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
