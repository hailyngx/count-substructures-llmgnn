Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three edges. 

In this given graph:
Edges (0, 2) and (2, 1) and (1, 0) form the triangle <0, 2, 1>.
Edges (0, 2) and (2, 8) and (8, 0) form the triangle <0, 2, 8>.
Edges (0, 7) and (7, 3) and (3, 0) form the triangle <0, 7, 3>.
Edges (1, 8) and (8, 2) and (2, 1) form the triangle <1, 8, 2>.
Edges (1, 9) and (9, 4) and (4, 1) form the triangle <1, 9, 4>.
Edges (1, 9) and (9, 5) and (5, 1) form the triangle <1, 9, 5>.
Edges (2, 1) and (1, 9) and (9, 2) form the triangle <2, 1, 9>.
Edges (2, 8) and (8, 1) and (1, 2) form the triangle <2, 8, 1>.
Edges (3, 7) and (7, 9) and (9, 3) form the triangle <3, 7, 9>.
Edges (6, 1) and (1, 2) and (2, 6) form the triangle <6, 1, 2>.
Edges (6, 1) and (1, 9) and (9, 6) form the triangle <6, 1, 9>.
Edges (8, 9) and (9, 1) and (1, 8) form the triangle <8, 9, 1>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is 11.
