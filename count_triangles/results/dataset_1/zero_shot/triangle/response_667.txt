Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 8 triangles in the graph. 
The final answer in brackets is: [8].
