Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<0, 8, 1>
<4, 8, 5>
<3, 1, 5>
<4, 0, 9>

So the final answer is [14].
