Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 9>, <5, 7, 9>.

There are a total of 5 triangles in the graph. They are within brackets as requested: [5].
