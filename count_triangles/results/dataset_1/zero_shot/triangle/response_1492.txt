Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
[<0, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 8, 7>, <6, 1, 5>, <6, 3, 9>, <6, 7, 2>] 

Therefore, the answer is [7].
