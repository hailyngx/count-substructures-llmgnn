Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, the number of triangles can be counted by identifying the unique triangles present. Here is a breakdown of the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangle <7, 8, 9>
3. Triangle <9, 5, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
