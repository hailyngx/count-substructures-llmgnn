Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles around each node. We can do this by examining each node and checking for triangles involving that node.

Upon analyzing the given graph, we find the following triangles:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 7, 5>, <7, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are 12 unique triangles in this graph. So the final answer is [12].
