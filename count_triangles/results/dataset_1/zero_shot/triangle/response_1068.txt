Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 26 triangles in the given graph.  

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 6>
<2, 8, 3>
<2, 9, 5>
<3, 0, 4>
<3, 8, 6>
<4, 7, 6>
<5, 2, 9>
<6, 7, 4>
<6, 7, 2>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 2>
<6, 8, 3>
<7, 2, 4>
<7, 2, 6>
<7, 4, 0>
<7, 6, 8>
<8, 2, 7>
<8, 3, 0>
<9, 2, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [26].
