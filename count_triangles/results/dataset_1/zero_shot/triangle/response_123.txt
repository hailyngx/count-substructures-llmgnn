Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 3, 4>
<5, 4, 6>
<5, 4, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 1, 7>
<9, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total.
