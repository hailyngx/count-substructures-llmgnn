Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 4.

Therefore, the answer is [4] and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 7>.
