Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7
- Node 2 is connected to node 7
- Node 3 is connected to node 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 9
- Node 5 is connected to node 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7

To count the number of triangles in this graph:
- A triangle consists of three nodes connected to each other.
- Each triangle contributes a total of 3 unique triangles since we can arrange the three nodes in 3! ways.

Let's determine the triangles:
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle <4, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6] (inside brackets).
