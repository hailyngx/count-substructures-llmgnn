Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <3, 5, 9> and <8, 9, 5>. 

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in total.
