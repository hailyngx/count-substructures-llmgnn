Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 2>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 8>

There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [8].
