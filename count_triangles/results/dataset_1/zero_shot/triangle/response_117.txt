Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, and <2, 4, 6>. So, the final answer is [4].
