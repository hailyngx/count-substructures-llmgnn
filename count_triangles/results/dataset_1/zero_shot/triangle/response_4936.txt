Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 1, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 0, 6>
<9, 0, 2>
<9, 2, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
