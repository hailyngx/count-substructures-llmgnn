Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph.  
The triangles are as follows:  
<0, 2, 3>  
<0, 2, 9>  
<0, 3, 4>  
<2, 3, 5>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<4, 5, 8>  
<4, 5, 9>  
<5, 9, 6>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
