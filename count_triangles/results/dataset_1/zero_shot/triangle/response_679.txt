Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as the following adjacency list:

0 -> [1, 2, 4, 7]
1 -> [0, 2, 6, 7, 8]
2 -> [0, 1, 3, 6, 8]
3 -> [2, 9]
4 -> [0]
6 -> [1, 2, 8]
7 -> [0, 1]
8 -> [1, 2, 6, 9]
9 -> [3, 8]

To count the number of triangles, we need to identify all sets of nodes that form triangles (i.e., each node is connected to the other two). Let's list the unique triangles below:

<0, 1, 2>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
