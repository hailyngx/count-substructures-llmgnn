Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 10 nodes and 30 edges. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

By examining the edges provided, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 3, 7>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 4, 9>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 7, 5>
4. Triangle 4: <0, 8, 9>

Thus, the graph contains 4 triangles in total. Hence, the answer is [4].
