Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
