Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 7, 3>
3. <1, 8, 9>
4. <2, 3, 6>
5. <2, 3, 9>
6. <3, 5, 6>
7. <3, 7, 8>

There are a total of 7 unique triangles in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
