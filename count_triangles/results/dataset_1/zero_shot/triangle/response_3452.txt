Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by looking at the triangles formed by sets of three connected nodes.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>

There are a total of 8 unique triangles in the graph, and thus the final answer is [8].
