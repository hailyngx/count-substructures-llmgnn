Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangle is a type of closed shape in a graph formed by 3 vertices and 3 edges connecting them. Let's identify the triangles in this graph.

The unique triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 6, 2>
<4, 7, 6>
<5, 3, 0>
<7, 8, 4>
<7, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
