Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 3, 0>
<1, 5, 0>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 6, 4>
<4, 6, 2>
<8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
