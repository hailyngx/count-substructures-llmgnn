Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<0, 4, 6>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
