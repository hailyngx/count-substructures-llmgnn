Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 2>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
