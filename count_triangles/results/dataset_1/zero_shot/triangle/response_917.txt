Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
We are given a graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges. To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify the unique triangles present.

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
