Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 5>, <5, 8, 6>.
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
