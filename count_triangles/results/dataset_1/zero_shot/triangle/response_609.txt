Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 0, 8>
<5, 2, 8>
<8, 3, 7>
<8, 4, 0>
<8, 5, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [14].
