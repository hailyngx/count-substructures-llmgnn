Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 6, 8>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
