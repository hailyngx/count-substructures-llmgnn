Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are: 
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 0>

There are [8] triangles in total.
