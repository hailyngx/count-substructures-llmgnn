Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by looking at each triplet of nodes and checking if they form a triangle. 

After analyzing the provided graph, we find that there are <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, and <4, 7, 9> triangles. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
