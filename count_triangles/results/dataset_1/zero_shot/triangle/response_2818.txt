Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 8, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 1>
<6, 7, 3>
