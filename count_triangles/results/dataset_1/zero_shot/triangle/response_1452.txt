Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 5 ,6>
<2, 5, 6>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 6>

There are total [13] triangles in the graph.
