Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
    0 --- 2
    |\   /|
    | \ / |
    | / \ |
    |/   \|
    3 --- 5 --- 1 --- 8
     \   |     |     |
      \  |     |     |
        \6 --- 9 --- 7

To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to count all possible triangles formed by three nodes. The triangles can be categorised based on the type of triangles: 
1. Triangles where all three nodes are connected directly (closed triangles).
2. Triangles where two nodes are connected directly and the third is connected indirectly through the other two nodes.

Let's list the unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 3>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 9, 7>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 3>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 9, 6>
<8, 9, 1>
<8, 9, 3>

Counting these unique triangles, we get [17].
