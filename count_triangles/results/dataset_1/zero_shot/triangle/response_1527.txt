Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
