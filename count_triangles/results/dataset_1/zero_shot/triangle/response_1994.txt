Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<7, 5, 0>
<7, 5, 9>
<7, 5, 0>
<7, 9, 6>
<7, 9, 4>
<7, 9, 6>
<8, 9, 6>
<8, 9, 4>
<8, 9, 6>

Therefore, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.
