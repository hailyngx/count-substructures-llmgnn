Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of closed paths of length 3 (triangles) within the graph.

For this graph, the triangles can be formed by looking at the connections between the nodes. Let's list all the possible triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <0, 6, 8>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <3, 0, 7>
7. <4, 6, 8>
8. <4, 6, 9>
9. <6, 1, 2>
10. <6, 2, 7>
11. <6, 2, 8>
12. <6, 4, 8>
13. <7, 0, 2>
14. <7, 0, 3>
15. <7, 2, 8>
16. <8, 2, 4>
17. <8, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in this graph. Hence, the final answer is [17].
