Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph.
