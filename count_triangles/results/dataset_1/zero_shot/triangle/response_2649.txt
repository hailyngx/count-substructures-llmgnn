Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [0].

Explanation:
In this graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 2.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 5.
- Node 7 is connected to node 2.
- Node 8 is connected to node 0.
- Node 9 is connected to node 5.

There are no triangles present in this graph as there are no sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the set.
