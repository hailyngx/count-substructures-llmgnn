Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the breakdown:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 1>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 3>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 3>
5. Triangle <3, 6, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 6>

The final answer is [6].
