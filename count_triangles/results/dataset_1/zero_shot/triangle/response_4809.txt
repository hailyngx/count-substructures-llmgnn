Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 9>.
