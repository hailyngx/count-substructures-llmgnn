Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 3, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
