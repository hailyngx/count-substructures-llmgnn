Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<8, 9, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
