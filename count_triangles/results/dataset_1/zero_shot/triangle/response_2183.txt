Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [16]. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 9, 6>
<3, 9, 6>
<4, 9, 6> 

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
