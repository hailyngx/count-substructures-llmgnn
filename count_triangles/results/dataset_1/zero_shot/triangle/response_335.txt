Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:
```plaintext
    0 -- 5 -- 1
    |    |    |
    7 -- 4 -- 2
            | \
            8 - 9
            |
            3
            |
            6
```

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all possible sets of three nodes that form triangles. 

The triangles present in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <6, 7, 8>

Count of triangles: [8]
