Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 4>
<5, 4, 7>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9> 

Therefore, the answer is [6].
