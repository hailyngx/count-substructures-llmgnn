Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles: 

<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 8, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 9>
<8, 5, 1>
<7, 0, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in this graph.
