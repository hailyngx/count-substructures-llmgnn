Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 8. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 7, 4>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 9, 5>
<4, 6, 5>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 9, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
