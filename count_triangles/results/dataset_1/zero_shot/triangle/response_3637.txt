Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 20 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:

[<1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
