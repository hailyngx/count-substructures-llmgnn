Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for combinations of three nodes that are all interconnected with each other. Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
