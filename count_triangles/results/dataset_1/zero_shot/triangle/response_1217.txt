Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as:

```
0 -- 4
 \      
  \
1---2
|  /  \
| /    \
|/      8
6---7   |
|\  |   |
| \ |   |
|  \|   |
5---4---9
```

To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible cycles of length 3. Let's list the triangles:

1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 4, 6>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <4, 6, 7>
6. <4, 7, 8>
7. <1, 6, 7>
8. <6, 7, 8>
9. <1, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 9.
