Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<0, 3, 9>
<0, 6, 5>
<2, 1, 0>
<2, 3, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
