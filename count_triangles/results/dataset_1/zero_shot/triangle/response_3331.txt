Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph is [6].

Unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>.
