Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by finding the number of closed loops of length 3 in the graph. Each triangle consists of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

In this case, let's count the number of triangles present in the given graph:

The unique triangles found in this graph are: 
<0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 7>  

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
