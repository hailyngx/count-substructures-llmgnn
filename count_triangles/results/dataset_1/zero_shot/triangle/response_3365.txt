Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, 3, 2>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 4, 1>
- <0, 9, 5>
- <1, 4, 0>
- <1, 9, 5>
- <3, 0, 4>
- <3, 2, 8>
- <4, 0, 9>
- <9, 1, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
