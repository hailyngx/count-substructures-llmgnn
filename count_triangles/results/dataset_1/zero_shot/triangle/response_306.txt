Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three nodes connected to each other. Let's analyze the given graph to determine the number of triangles:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6.

Now, let's find the triangles present in the graph:
1. <2, 6, 9>
2. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2. Hence, the final answer is [2].
