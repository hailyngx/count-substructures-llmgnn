Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 1, 4>, <4, 1, 9>.
