Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
