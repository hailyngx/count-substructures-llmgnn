Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can form the following triangles:

<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [9].
