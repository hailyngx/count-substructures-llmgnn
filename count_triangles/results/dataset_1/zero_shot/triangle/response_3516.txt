Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 8, 2>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 2, 9>
<4, 2, 8>
<4, 2, 3>
<4, 8, 3>
<1, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
