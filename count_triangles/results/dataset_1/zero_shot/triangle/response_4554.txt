Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 3>
<3, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
