Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by each set of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

There are 6 triangles in total in the given graph. Here they are:
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the answer is [6].
