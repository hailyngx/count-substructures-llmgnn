Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 7, 4>
<9, 1, 4>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
