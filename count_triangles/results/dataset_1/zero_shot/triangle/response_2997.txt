Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<2, 0, 1>
<2, 4, 1>
<4, 9, 6>
<8, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
