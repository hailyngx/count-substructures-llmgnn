Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<7, 5, 9>
<8, 0, 4>
<8, 0, 2>
<8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
