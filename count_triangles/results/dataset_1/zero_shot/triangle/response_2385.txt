Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
