Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
    1 -- 2
   /|    | \
  / |    |  \
 0  3 -- 4   5
 |     /     |
  \   /      /
    6 ------ 7
        |
        8
        |
        9
```

To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's find these triangles:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 3, 1>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 8, 3>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 9, 5>
4. Triangle 4: <1, 2, 3>
5. Triangle 5: <0, 3, 8>

So there are 5 triangles in total. Hence, the answer is [5].
