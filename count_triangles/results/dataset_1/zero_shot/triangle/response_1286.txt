Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are: 

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 1, 6>
<5, 2, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<7, 2, 5>
<7, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 4>
<1, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
