Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, the triangles present in the graph could be counted as follows:

Triangles:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 
The number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
