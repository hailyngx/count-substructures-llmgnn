Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles: 
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 6>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 9, 0>, <6, 8, 2>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
