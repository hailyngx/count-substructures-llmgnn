Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <3, 6, 9>
2. <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the graph.
