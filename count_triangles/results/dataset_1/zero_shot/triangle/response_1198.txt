Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
 
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
