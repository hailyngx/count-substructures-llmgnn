Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows: 

<0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 9, 6>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 3>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 2, 6>, <3, 2, 9>, <3, 5, 4>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 4>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 1>, <6, 9, 3>, <7, 1, 6>, <7, 1, 3>, <7, 3, 4>, <9, 0, 5>, <9, 0, 8>, <9, 3, 7>, <9, 3, 6>

Therefore, there are 29 triangles in this graph.
