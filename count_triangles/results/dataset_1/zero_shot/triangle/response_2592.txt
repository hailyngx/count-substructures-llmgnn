Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the answer is [9].
