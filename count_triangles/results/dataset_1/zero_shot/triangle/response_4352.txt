Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three connected nodes.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
