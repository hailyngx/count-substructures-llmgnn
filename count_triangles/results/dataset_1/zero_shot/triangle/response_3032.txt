Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
