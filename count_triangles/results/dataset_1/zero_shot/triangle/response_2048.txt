Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 8, 5>
<1, 6, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 9, 8>
<4, 5, 8>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
