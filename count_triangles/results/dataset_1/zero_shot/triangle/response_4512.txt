Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph described has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 4>, <6, 7, 0>, <8, 9, 3>.

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
