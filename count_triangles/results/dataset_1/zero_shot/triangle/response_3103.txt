Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the graph. Here they are listed inside the brackets [] after removing the duplicate triangles:
[<1, 5, 6> <1, 6, 9> <1, 5, 4> <1, 5, 2>]
