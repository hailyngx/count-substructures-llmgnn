Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be found by calculating the number of triangles each node participates in and then dividing by 3, because each triangle is counted three times (once for each node). 

For this graph, here are the triangles:
- Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 0, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, 6.
- Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 5.

Counting the triangles from each node gives a total count of 20 triangles, so dividing by 3, we get 6 triangles in total. 

Therefore, the answer is: [<0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 9>]. [6]
