Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) 

Response:
In this graph, there are 3 triangles. The unique triangles are <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, and <4, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
