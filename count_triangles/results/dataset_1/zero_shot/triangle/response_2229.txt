Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining each triplet of nodes and checking if there exist edges between each pair of nodes in the triplet.

After evaluating all possible triplets of nodes, we find that there are 4 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4] and the unique triangles are <0, 3, 4>, <4, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, and <1, 6, 8>.
