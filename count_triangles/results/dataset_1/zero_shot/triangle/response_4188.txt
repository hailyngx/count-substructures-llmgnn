Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be found by examining all possible combinations of 3 nodes which form a cycle. 

After examining the given graph, we can see the following triangles:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph, and the final answer is [4].
