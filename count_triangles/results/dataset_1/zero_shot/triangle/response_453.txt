Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 4>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 5>, <3, 9, 2>, <3, 8, 5>.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
