Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 7> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
