Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 1, 0>, <3, 4, 2>, <4, 2, 6>, <5, 8, 7>, <5, 6, 2>, <7, 8, 5>, <9, 7, 6>.
