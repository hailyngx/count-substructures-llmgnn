Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <5, 4, 8>, <6, 1, 2>, and <6, 2, 9>.  

So, the final answer is [6].
