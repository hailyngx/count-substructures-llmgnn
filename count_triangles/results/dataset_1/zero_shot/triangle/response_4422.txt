Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<5, 1, 9>, <5, 3, 9>, <7, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
