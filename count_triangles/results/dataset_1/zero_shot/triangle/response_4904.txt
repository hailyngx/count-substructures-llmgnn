Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 8>.
