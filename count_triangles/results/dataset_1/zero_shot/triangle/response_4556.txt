Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, and <2, 4, 7>. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
