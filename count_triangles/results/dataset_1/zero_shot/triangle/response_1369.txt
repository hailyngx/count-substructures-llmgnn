Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 2>
<3, 8, 7>
<1, 7, 8>

Hence, the total number of triangles is [7].
