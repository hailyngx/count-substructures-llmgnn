Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by calculating the number of triangles each node is involved in and summing it up. 

In this graph:
- Node 0 is involved in 3 triangles: <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>
- Node 1 is involved in 0 triangles
- Node 2 is involved in 0 triangles
- Node 3 is involved in 5 triangles: <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 8>
- Node 4 is involved in 1 triangle: <0, 4, 9>
- Node 5 is involved in 0 triangles
- Node 6 is involved in 2 triangles: <2, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>
- Node 7 is involved in 0 triangles
- Node 8 is involved in 2 triangles: <0, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 8>
- Node 9 is involved in 1 triangle: <3, 4, 9>

Adding them all up:
3 + 0 + 0 + 5 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 14

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 6, 8> 

So, the final answer is: [14].
