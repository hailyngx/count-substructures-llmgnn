Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed as requested: 

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
