Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are <1, 2, 5>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 1>, <1, 2, 5>, <0, 8, 5>, <5, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 1>, <2, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 5, 7>.
