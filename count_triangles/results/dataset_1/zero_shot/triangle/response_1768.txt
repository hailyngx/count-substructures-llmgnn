Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be counted by looking at each node and checking for triangles involving that node.

First, let's list all the triangles found:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>

The total count of triangles is 8.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
