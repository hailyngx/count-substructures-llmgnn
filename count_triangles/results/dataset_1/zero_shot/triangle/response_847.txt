Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by looking for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the set.

After examining the provided edges, the triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 7, 1>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 8, 0>
<1, 8, 2>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
