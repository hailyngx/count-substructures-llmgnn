Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 9, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <8, 9, 6>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [7].
