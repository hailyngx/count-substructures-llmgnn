Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed within angle brackets < >:

[<0, 1, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 1>, <2, 6, 4>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 2>, <6, 9, 0>]   [9 triangles total]
