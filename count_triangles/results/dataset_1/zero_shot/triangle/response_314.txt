Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are total of 27 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found and counted:

[<0, 8, 9> <0, 9, 5> <0, 9, 7> <2, 7, 5> <7, 2, 6> <0, 8, 2> <0, 5, 2> <2, 4, 6> <0, 7, 5> <2, 7, 9> <0, 8, 9>]
