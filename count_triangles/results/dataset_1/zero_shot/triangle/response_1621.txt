Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of closed loops of length 3 formed by the edges. Let's find the triangles in this graph.

The unique triangles in this graph are: 
<1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 4, 8>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [10].
