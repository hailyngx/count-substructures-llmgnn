Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 -- 9
   /      
  2 - 4 - 8
 /|  |  /|
0 |  6 -7
 \|
  3
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can examine all possible triangles formed by a set of three nodes connected by edges.

We find the following triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 4: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 6: <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle 7: <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle 8: <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
