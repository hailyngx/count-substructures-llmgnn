Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(d_i - 1)(d_i - 2) \]

where \( d_i \) represents the degree of node \( i \).

Given the graph details, we can calculate the number of triangles by using this formula. Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Calculate the degree of each node:
   - Node 0: degree = 3
   - Node 1: degree = 1
   - Node 2: degree = 3
   - Node 3: degree = 4
   - Node 4: degree = 3
   - Node 5: degree = 2
   - Node 6: degree = 1
   - Node 7: degree = 2
   - Node 8: degree = 5
   - Node 9: degree = 1

2. Substitute the degrees into the formula:
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} [(3)(2)(1) + (1)(0)(-1) + (3)(2)(1) + (4)(3)(2) + (3)(2)(1) + (2)(1)(0) + (1)(0)(-1) + (2)(1)(0) + (5)(4)(3) + (1)(0)(-1)] \]

3. Calculate the total number of triangles:
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} [6 + 0 + 6 + 24 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 60 + 0] \]
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} * 102 \]
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = 17 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 17 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles in the graph:
\[ [ <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 3>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 7, 0>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 8, 0>, <2, 8, 3>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 0>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 4>, <4, 5, 3>, <8, 0, 7> ] \]
