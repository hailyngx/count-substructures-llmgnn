Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles formed in this graph are:

<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>

There are a total of 2 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [2].
