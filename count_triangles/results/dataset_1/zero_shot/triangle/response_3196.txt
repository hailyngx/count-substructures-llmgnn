Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we count the triangles by examining each set of three nodes connected by both edges. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<8, 1, 9>
<8, 5, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
