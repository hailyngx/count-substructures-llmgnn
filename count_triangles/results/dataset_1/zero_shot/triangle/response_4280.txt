Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by examining all possible sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

- <0, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
