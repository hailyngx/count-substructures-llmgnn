Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
[<0, 5, 7> <2, 1, 5> <2, 5, 6> <5, 3, 6> <4, 5, 8>] 

There are 5 triangles in total. So, the final answer is [5].
