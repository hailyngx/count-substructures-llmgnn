Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 7, 6>
<2, 5, 3>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
