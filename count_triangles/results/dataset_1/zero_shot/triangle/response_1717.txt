Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <1, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the graph.
