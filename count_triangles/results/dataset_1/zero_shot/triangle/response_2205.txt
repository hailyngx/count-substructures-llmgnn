Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles listed inside <>:

<0, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 1, 5>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 0, 3>
<6, 1, 2>
<8, 2, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
