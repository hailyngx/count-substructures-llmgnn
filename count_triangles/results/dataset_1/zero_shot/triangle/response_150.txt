Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 3>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 8, 6>  
There are [4] triangles in total in this graph.
