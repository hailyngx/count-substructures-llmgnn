Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

From the given edges, the triangles in the graph are:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
