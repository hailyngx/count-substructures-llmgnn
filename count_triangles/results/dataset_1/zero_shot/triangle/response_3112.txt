Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <4, 5, 9>.
