Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining all possible combinations of 3 nodes that form a closed loop. Let's go ahead and calculate the number of triangles present in the given graph.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
