Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 9>.
