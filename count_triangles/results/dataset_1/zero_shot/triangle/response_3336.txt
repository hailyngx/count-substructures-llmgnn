Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by finding all unique combinations of 3 nodes that form a triangle.

After analyzing the provided graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 3>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 0>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 8, 2>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 9, 2>
<1, 9, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 0>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 0>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 7>
<5, 2, 9>
<6, 0, 3>
<8, 7, 4>
<8, 7, 3>
<8, 9, 1>
<8, 9, 2>
<8, 9, 4>
<9, 2, 8>
<9, 5, 2>

Therefore, there are 33 unique triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [33].
