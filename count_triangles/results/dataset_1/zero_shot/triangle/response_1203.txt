Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining all possible combinations of three nodes that are interconnected. Here are the unique triangles along with their node numbers:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<5, 4, 6>
<1, 0, 7>
<7, 2, 4>
<7, 2, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
