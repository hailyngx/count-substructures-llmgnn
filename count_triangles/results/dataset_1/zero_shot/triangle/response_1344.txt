Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
In order to count the number of triangles in the graph, let's first list out all the triangles present:
<0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
