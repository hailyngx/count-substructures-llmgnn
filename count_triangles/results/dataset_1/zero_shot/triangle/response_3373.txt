Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, and <4, 6, 7>.

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
