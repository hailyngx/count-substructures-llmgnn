Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) 

Response:
The graph has 5 triangles. 
The triangles are: <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 1, 3>, <3, 4, 7>.
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
