Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 19. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 1, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 1, 9>
<7, 5, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<8, 3, 1>
<8, 6, 1>
<8, 7, 2>

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
