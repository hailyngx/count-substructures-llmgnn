Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 2), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 3), (6, 4), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 8), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 7), (9, 4)

To count the number of triangles, let's look at each possible triangle:

1. Node 0: No triangles including this node.
2. Node 1: No triangles including this node.
3. Node 2: Triangle <0, 2, 1>
4. Node 3: No triangles including this node.
5. Node 4: No triangles including this node.
6. Node 5: No triangles including this node.
7. Node 6: No triangles including this node.
8. Node 7: No triangles including this node.
9. Node 8: No triangles including this node.
10. Node 9: No triangles including this node.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1]. The unique triangle found is <0, 2, 1>.
