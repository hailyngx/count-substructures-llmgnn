Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles using each node and checking if the edges between those nodes exist. Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph.

The triangles that can be formed using the given edges are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 1>
<2, 3, 0>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 0>
<4, 8, 6>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 8, 0>
<4, 8, 6>
<4, 1, 0>
<5, 2, 0>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<8, 7, 6>
<9, 5, 0>
<9, 5, 2>
<9, 5, 6>
<9, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are 20 triangles in total. So, the final answer is [20].
