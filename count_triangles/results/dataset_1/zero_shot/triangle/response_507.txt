Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 9, 4>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 9, 5>.
    
    Thus, there are a total of 6 triangles in the graph. 
    
    Therefore, the final answer is [6].
