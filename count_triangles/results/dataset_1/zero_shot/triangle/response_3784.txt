Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].  
The unique triangles are <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>.
