Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by finding all unique sets of three nodes that are all connected by edges. 

By examining the provided edges, we can identify the following list of unique triangles:
<2, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
