Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are total of 3 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: <0, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
