Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
