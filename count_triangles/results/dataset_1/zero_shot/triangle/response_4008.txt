Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 2>
<2, 5, 1>
<3, 1, 8>
<3, 7, 2>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 4, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [10].
