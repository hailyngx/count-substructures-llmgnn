Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 0, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 9, 4>
<3, 2, 5>
<4, 3, 9>
<5, 0, 7>
<5, 1, 2>
<6, 7, 9>
<8, 5, 9>
<9, 2, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
