Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 9, 1>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 6, 0>
<1, 7, 3>
<2, 4, 1>
<3, 6, 0>
<4, 5, 1>
<4, 6, 0>
<5, 4, 1>
<6, 0, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
