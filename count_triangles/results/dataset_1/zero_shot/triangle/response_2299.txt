Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
