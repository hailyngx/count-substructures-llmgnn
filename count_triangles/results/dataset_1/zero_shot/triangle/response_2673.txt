Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: 

<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

There are 8 triangles in total. 
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
