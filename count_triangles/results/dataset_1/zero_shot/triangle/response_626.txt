Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated using the handshake lemma and degree of each node. Upon counting, it is found to be 10 triangles.

Therefore, the final answer is [10] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 1, 2>, <5, 6, 3>.
