Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are formed by nodes that are interconnected. Let's list them:

<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>

There are 7 unique triangles in the given graph, so the final answer is [7].
