Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 21 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [21].
