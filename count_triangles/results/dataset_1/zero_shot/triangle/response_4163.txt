Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. They are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
