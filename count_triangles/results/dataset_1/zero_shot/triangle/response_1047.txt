Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by finding the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. Let's analyze the given graph to find the number of triangles.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
