Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(d_i - 1)(d_i - 2) \]

where \( d_i \) represents the degree of node \( i \).

Now, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} [(4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2) + (6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4) + (5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3) + (5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3) + (7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5) + (4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2) + (4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2) + (6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4) + (6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4) + (4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2)] \]

Calculating the above expression gives us:
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} [24 + 120 + 60 + 60 + 210 + 24 + 24 + 120 + 120 + 24] \]
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{826}{6} = 137 \]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [137]. The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 9>
