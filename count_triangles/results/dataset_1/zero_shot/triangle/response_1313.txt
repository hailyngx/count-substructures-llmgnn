Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [3].
