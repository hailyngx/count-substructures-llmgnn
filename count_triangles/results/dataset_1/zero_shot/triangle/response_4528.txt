Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 8, 5>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
