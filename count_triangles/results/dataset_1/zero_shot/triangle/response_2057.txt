Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining the triangles formed by every set of three nodes. Here, we have the following triangles in the graph: 

<0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 8>

Hence, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
