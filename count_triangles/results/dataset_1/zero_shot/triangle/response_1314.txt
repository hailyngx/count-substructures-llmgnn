Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by identifying all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. 

After analyzing the graph provided, we can identify the following unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 2, 3>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [8].
