Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [27] triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are as follows:
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<8, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 7, 9>
<8, 3, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 4>
<4, 3, 5>
<7, 4, 8>
<2, 8, 5> 

Therefore, the final answer is [27].
