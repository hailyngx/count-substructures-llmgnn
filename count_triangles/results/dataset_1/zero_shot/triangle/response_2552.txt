Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are <0, 2, 5>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <2, 3, 7>.
