Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 1>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 0, 8>, <5, 0, 9>, <8, 2, 0>
There are 10 triangles in total. So, the answer is [10].
