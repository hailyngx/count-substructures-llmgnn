Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here they are represented in unique form:

<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
