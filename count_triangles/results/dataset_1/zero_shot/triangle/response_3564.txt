Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>
So there are a total of [5] triangles in this graph.
