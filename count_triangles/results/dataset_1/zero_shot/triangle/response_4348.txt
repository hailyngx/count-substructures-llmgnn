Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, and <2, 5, 6>.
