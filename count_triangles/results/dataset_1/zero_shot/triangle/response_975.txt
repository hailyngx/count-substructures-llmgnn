Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 1>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 8, 3>
<2, 8, 7>
<4, 9, 2>
<5, 6, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
