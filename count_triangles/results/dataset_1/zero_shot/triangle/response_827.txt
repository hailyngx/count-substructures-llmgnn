Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by each set of three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other forming a cycle.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph by looking at the cycles of length 3.

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of 7 triangles in the graph. Hence, the answer is [7].
