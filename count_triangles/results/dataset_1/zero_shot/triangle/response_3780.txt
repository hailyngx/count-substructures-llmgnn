Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 16 triangles in total. The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 0, 3>
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 4, 1>
<6, 9, 8>
<7, 0, 3>
<7, 3, 6>
<7, 5, 4>
<7, 6, 1>
<8, 6, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
