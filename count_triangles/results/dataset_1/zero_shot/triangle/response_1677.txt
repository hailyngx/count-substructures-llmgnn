Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 8, 5>, <2, 7, 5>, <4, 8, 9>, <8, 6, 9>. 

Hence, there are 12 triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [12].
