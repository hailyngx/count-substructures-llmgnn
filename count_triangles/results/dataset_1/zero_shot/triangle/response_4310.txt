Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 9, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
