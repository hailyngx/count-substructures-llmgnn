Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets:

[<0, 1, 4> <0, 1, 6> <1, 3, 5> <1, 4, 5> <1, 4, 6> <1, 5, 6> <3, 5, 6>]
