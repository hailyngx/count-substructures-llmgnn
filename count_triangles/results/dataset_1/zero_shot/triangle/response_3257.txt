Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 2 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles found: 

<1, 4, 9>
<8, 9, 6>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
