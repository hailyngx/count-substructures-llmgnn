Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The unique triangles found in the given graph are: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 9>.
    
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
