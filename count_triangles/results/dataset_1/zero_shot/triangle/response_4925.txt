Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [10] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 7> 

Therefore, the final answer is [<4, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <0, 1, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 7>].
