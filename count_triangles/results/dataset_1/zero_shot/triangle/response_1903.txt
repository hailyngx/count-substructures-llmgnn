Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: 
<0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 0, 3>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 1, 6>, <3, 0, 2>, <3, 1, 6>, <3, 1, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 2, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 1, 9>, <7, 4, 9>, <8, 9, 5>

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in this graph.  
So, the final answer is: [18].
