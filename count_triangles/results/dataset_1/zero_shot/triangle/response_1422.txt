Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by calculating the number of closed loops of length 3. In this case, we have the following triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <0, 1, 9>
4. <0, 5, 8>
5. <0, 5, 9>
6. <1, 5, 8>
7. <1, 5, 9>
8. <5, 6, 7>
9. <5, 6, 9>
10. <6, 7, 5>
11. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
