Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

[<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 0>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>]
