Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can form the following triangles:
<1, 2, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
