Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of paths of length 2 between all possible node pairs.

The unique triangles in the given graph are: <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <4, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
