Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <0, 3, 2>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <2, 3, 8>
5. <4, 3, 7>
6. <4, 7, 1>
7. <4, 3, 5>
8. <4, 5, 6>
9. <7, 1, 4>
10. <9, 0, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph.
