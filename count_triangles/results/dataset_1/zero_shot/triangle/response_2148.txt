Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be found by looking for all possible triangles based on the given edges. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 4>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<8, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
