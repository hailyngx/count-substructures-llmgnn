Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
