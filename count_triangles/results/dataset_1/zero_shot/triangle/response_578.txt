Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, and <5, 7, 9>.
