Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 3, 4>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
