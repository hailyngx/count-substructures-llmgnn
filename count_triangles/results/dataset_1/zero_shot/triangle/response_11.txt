Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of closed paths of length 3. We can find the triangles in the given graph by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After examining the edges given, we find the following triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 6, 1>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 5>
<4, 8, 5>
<6, 8, 5>
<6, 9, 5>
<6, 9, 1>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [9].
