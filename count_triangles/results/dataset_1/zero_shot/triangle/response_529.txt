Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:  
<0, 1, 3>  
<0, 3, 4>  
<0, 4, 9>  
<0, 7, 9>  
<2, 7, 9>  
<3, 4, 9>  
<3, 7, 9>  
<4, 9, 7>  

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the graph. [8]
