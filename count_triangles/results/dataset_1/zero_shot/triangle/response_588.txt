Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are total of 12 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<7, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 9, 8>
<5, 6, 1>
<6, 5, 1>

So, the final answer is: [12]
