Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
[<0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 9, 4>, <0, 9, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 0, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <6, 5, 7>]  
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
