Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 18 triangles in the graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 4, 2>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 2>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 2>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 0, 2>
<4, 2, 7>
<5, 3, 6>
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 2, 4>
<7, 4, 6>
<8, 0, 1>
<8, 1, 2>

So, the final answer is [18].
