Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in this graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
