Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 3, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 2, 0>, <6, 2, 4>, <7, 1, 3>, <7, 3, 9>, <7, 9, 8>

Total number of triangles: [12]
