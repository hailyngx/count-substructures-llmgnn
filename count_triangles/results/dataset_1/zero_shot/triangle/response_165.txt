Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. Let's count the number of triangles.

Observing the graph, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph: [<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 9>].
