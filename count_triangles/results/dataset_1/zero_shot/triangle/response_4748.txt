Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 0>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 4>, <2, 1, 8>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
