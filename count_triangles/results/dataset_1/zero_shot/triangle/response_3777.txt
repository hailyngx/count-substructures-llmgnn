Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<0, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
