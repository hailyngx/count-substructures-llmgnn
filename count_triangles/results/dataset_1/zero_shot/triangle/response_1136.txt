Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is involved in. Let's go ahead and calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0 is not involved in any triangles.
- Node 1 is not involved in any triangles.
- Node 2 is involved in 4 triangles: <2, 7, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 8>.
- Node 3 is not involved in any triangles.
- Node 4 is involved in 1 triangle: <4, 7, 2>.
- Node 5 is not involved in any triangles.
- Node 6 is not involved in any triangles.
- Node 7 is involved in 5 triangles: <7, 2, 8>, <7, 6, 2>, <7, 3, 9>, <7, 0, 2>, <7, 6, 8>.
- Node 8 is not involved in any triangles.
- Node 9 is not involved in any triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 10. The unique triangles found are: <2, 7, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 2>, <7, 2, 8>, <7, 6, 2>, <7, 3, 9>, <7, 0, 2>. Thus, the final answer is [10].
