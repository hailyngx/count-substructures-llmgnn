Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 8, 1>
<2, 1, 8>
<6, 7, 2>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 1>
<7, 8, 2>
<8, 3, 6>
<8, 3, 4>

There are a total of 10 triangles in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
