Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 2, 3>, 
<2, 5, 6>, 
<2, 5, 7>, 
<2, 6, 7>, 
<2, 7, 9>, 
<4, 5, 7>, 
<4, 7, 9>, 
<5, 6, 7>, 
<7, 8, 9>.
So, the final answer is [9].
