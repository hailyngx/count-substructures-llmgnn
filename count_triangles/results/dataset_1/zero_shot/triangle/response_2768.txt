This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [0].

Explanation:
- There are no triangles present in the given graph.
- However, for completeness, the unique triangles can be listed as follows: <>
- Therefore, the final answer is [0].
