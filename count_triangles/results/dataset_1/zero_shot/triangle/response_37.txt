Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 0, 6>
<2, 0, 9>
<2, 1, 3>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
