Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <8, 9, 3>, <8, 9, 7>, <3, 8, 9>.
