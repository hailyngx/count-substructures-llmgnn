Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 3 -- 9
|         |
7 -- 4 -- 8
|       /
1 -- 2
  \
   5
   |
   6
```

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Calculating the triangles, we find that the graph contains 3 triangles. 

The triangles are:
1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 7, 8>
3. <1, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
