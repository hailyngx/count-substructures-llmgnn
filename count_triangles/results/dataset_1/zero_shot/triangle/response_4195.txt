Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be formed from the following sets of nodes:
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 7, 9> 

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in total.
