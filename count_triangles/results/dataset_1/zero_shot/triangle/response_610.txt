Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:

<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 2, 8>
<5, 4, 2>
<7, 3, 6>
<7, 3, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [9].
