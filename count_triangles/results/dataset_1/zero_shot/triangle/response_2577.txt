Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges is [6].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
