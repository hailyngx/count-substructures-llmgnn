Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: <3, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, and <4, 8, 9>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
