Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 5>.
