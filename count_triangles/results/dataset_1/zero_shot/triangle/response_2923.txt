Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
