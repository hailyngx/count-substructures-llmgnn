Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by counting all possible triangles formed by the existing edges. 

Upon examining the given graph, we observe the following unique triangles:
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 1>
<2, 6, 3>
<4, 8, 1>
<9, 7, 1>
<9, 8, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
