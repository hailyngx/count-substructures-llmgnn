Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by examining the possible closed loops of length 3. We will now list all unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <2, 3, 5>
3. <4, 5, 6>
4. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
