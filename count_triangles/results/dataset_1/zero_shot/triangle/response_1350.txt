Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [15]
