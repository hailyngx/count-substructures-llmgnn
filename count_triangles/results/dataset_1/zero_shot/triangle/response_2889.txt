Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6] and they are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <4, 5, 9>.
