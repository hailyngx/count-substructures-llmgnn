Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<0, 1, 4>,
<0, 2, 7>,
<1, 4, 7>,
<1, 8, 5>,
<7, 4, 1>,
<7, 8, 1>,
<7, 8, 5>,
<7, 8, 9>,
<8, 5, 3>,
<8, 5, 9>,
<8, 7, 6>,
<8, 7, 9>,
<9, 7, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
