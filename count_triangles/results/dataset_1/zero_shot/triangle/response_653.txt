Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <1, 2, 8>
5. <2, 5, 8>
6. <2, 8, 9>
7. <3, 5, 8>
8. <6, 7, 9>
9. <9, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [9].
