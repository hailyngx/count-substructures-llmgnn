Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by determining the number of unique paths of length 2 between nodes. 

From the given graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
