Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, and <1, 5, 9> triangles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
