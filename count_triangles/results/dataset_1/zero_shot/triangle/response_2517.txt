Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
