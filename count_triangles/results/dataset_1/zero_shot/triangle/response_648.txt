Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique triangles in the given graph:
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 5>
<2, 8, 5>
<4, 5, 7>
<7, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
