Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed within angular brackets:

<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
