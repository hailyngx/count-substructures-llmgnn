Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by checking all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges.  

After checking all the combinations, I found the following triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 6, 9>
<4, 2, 5>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 2, 9>
<5, 3, 6>
<8, 0, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
