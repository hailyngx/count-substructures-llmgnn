Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 5, 2>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<5, 8, 7>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [4].
