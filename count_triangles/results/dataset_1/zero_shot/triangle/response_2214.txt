Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is part of and then dividing by 3, as each triangle is counted three times (once for each node). 

After analyzing the graph, the triangles found are: 
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
