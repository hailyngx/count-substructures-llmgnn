Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <8, 9, 2>]
