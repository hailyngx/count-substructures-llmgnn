Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 7, 8>
<3, 2, 5>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the graph.
