Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 27 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:  
<0, 4, 7>  
<0, 4, 8>  
<0, 7, 8>  
<1, 2, 8>  
<2, 6, 8>  
<7, 8, 9>  
<0, 7, 9>  
<0, 8, 9>  

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
