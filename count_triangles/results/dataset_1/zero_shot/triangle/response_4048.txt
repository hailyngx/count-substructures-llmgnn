Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:  
$$\text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i} deg(v_i) \times (deg(v_i) - 1) \times (deg(v_i) - 2)$$

where $deg(v_i)$ is the degree of node $v_i$.  

For this given graph, the degrees of each node are:  
0: 2  
1: 3  
2: 4  
3: 2  
4: 3  
5: 3  
6: 3  
7: 5  
8: 1  
9: 6  

So, substituting these values into the formula:  
$$\text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \left(2 \times 1 \times 0 + 3 \times 2 \times 1 + 4 \times 3 \times 2 + 2 \times 1 \times 0 + 3 \times 2 \times 1 + 3 \times 2 \times 1 + 3 \times 2 \times 1 + 5 \times 4 \times 3 + 1 \times 0 \times 0 + 6 \times 5 \times 4 \right)$$  
$$\text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \times 104 = 17.33$$  

This means there are 17 unique triangles in the given graph.  

Therefore, the final answer is [17].
