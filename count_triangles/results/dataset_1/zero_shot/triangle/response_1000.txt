Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

```
    1 -- 3 -- 6 -- 4
    |         |    |
    0 -- 2 -- 7    5
     \    |   |
       \  |   |
          8 -- 9
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. 

After analyzing the graph, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <2, 8, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
