Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the given graph:

```
    0 --- 4           8
    |       \         |
    |        \        |
    |         \       |
    |          \      |
    8           0     7
                 |   || \
                 |   ||  2
                 1   7  
                    / | \
                   2  6  3
                  |     |
                  6     1
                   \    |
                    9   7
``` 

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph.

There are 3 triangles in this graph. The triangles can be represented as follows: 
<0, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the answer is [3].
