Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 5>, <6, 7, 8>, <8, 9, 5>

Therefore, there are 17 triangles in the given graph.
