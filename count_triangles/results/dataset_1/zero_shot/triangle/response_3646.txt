Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:
[<1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <0, 4, 2>, <1, 7, 6>, <3, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 3>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <7, 9, 3>, <0, 4, 2>, <2, 4, 0>]  
Therefore, the final answer is [12].
