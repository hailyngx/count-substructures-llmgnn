Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 1>
<2, 9, 1>
<2, 7, 0>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 1>
<3, 8, 6>
<5, 1, 9>
<7, 0, 2>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
