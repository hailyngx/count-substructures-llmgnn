Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be described as follows:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <4, 3, 8>
7. Triangle <3, 4, 8>

Total number of triangles: [7]
