Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 9, 7>
<5, 9, 7>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. The answer is [10].
