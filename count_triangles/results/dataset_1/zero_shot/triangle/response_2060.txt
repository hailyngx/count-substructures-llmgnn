Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of closed loops of length 3.

By examining the given graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 9>, <2, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
