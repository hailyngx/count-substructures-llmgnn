Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
