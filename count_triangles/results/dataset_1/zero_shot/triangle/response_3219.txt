Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed in increasing order:

[<0, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 6>, <5, 7, 9>] 

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
