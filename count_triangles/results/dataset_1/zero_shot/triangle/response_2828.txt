Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 5) (8, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 8, 5>

Hence, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.  
So, the final answer is [5].
