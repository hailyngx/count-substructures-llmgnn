Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by examining all possible triangles involving each node. However, counting the triangles manually can be time-consuming. 

Instead, we can identify the triangles based on the given edges. Let's find the unique triangles:

- Nodes 0, 4, 5 form a triangle <0, 4, 5>.
- Nodes 1, 5, 6 form a triangle <1, 5, 6>.
- Nodes 2, 4, 5 form a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
- Nodes 2, 5, 7 form a triangle <2, 5, 7>.
- Nodes 2, 5, 9 form a triangle <2, 5, 9>.
- Nodes 3, 1, 9 form a triangle <3, 1, 9>.
- Nodes 4, 5, 6 form a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
- Nodes 5, 6, 9 form a triangle <5, 6, 9>.

Therefore, there are 8 unique triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [8].
