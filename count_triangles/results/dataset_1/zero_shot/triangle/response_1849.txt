Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

    1 --- 0 --- 2
    |     |     |
    4 --- 6 --- 7
    |           |
    9 --- 3 --- 8
    |
    5

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we can examine each triplet of nodes and check if each possible edge is present. Let's list the unique triangles found:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 8, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 unique triangles in the given graph. [10]
