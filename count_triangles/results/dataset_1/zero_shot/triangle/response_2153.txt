Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is [9].

The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 9>.
