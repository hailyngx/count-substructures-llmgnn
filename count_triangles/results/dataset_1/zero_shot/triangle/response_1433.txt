Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node is part of and then dividing the result by 3 since each triangle is counted 3 times (once for each vertex).

After analyzing the provided edges, the triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph, so the final answer is [9].
