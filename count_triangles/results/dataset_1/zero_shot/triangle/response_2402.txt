Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by counting the triangles formed by sets of 3 nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Let's go ahead and find all the triangles present in the given graph:

<0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
