Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
