Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 8, 5>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 8, 5>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 3, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
