Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>

There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [8].
