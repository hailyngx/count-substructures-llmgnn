Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles found in the given graph are:
<1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 8, 7>, <2, 1, 5>, <4, 1, 5>, <5, 1, 8>, <5, 1, 9>, <6, 0, 4>, <7, 4, 6>

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the graph.
