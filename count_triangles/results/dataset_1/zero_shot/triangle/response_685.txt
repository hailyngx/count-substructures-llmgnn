Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 15 unique triangles in this graph, and they are as follows: 

<0, 1, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 4>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 6, 2>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 9, 5>, <2, 6, 9>, <6, 1, 0>, <6, 2, 9>, <6, 3, 5>, <9, 8, 4>, <9, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [15].
