Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph, and they are:

<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
