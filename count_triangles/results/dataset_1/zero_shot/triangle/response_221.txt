Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. 

After examining the edges provided, the unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
