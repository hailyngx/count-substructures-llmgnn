Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 4, 5>
Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [6].
