Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:
[<1, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 2>, <1, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <0, 8, 5>, <3, 1, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, <6, 7, 8>, <4, 2, 8>, <6, 7, 9>]  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
