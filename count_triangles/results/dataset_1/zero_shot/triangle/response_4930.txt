Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 12 triangles. Here are the unique triangles found:
[<0, 8, 4>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 5>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 0, 8>, <1, 7, 4>, <4, 8, 0>, <4, 8, 7>] 
Therefore, the answer is [12].
