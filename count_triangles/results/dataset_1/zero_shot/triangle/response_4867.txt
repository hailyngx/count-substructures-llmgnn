Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph described has 10 nodes and 22 edges. To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can identify the triangles formed by each set of three nodes connected by either 3 edges or 2 edges with a shared node.

The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 7, 8>
<6, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in total.
