Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<8, 9, 1>

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
