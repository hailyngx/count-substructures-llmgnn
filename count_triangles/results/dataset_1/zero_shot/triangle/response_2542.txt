Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
