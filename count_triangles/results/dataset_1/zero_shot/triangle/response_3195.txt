Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by each possible combination of 3 connected nodes.

Upon examining the given graph, there are 5 unique triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle 4: <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
