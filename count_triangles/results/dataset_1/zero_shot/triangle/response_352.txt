Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
[<1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 0>, <4, 5, 6>, <3, 1, 9>, <3, 8, 9>]
