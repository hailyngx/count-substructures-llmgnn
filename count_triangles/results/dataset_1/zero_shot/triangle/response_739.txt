Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <1, 4, 6>
6. <3, 5, 7>
7. <4, 6, 8>
8. <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
