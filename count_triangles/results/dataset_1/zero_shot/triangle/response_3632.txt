Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 5>

There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. [4]
