Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 0, 3>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 6, 2>
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 6, 1>
<3, 0, 4>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 3, 5>
<5, 4, 2>
<6, 1, 0>
<6, 1, 2>
<6, 2, 4>
<6, 7, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
