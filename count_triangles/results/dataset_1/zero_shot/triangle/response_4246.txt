Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph forms the following triangles:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 2>
<2, 0, 9>
<5, 3, 7>
<9, 0, 2>
<9, 1, 2>
<9, 2, 3>
<9, 3, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
