Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph.
Triangles can be formed when three nodes are interconnected. All possible triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <1, 4, 9>
5. <1, 7, 4>
6. <3, 8, 9>
7. <4, 7, 9>
8. <6, 9, 4>
9. <9, 6, 1>

There are 9 triangles in total. So, the final answer is [9].
