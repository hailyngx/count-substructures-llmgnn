Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are total of 5 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
