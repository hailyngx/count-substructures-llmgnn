Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <7, 9, 5>] 

So, the final answer is [10].
