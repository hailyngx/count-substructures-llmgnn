Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
