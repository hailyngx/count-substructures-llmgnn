Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles:
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 0, 7>

There are a total of 4 unique triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
