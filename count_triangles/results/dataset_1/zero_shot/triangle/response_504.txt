Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <2, 5, 6>
5. <2, 6, 7>
6. <3, 5, 6>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [6].
