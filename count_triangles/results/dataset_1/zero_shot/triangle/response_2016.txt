Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 13 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
