Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <7, 9, 5>, <7, 9, 6>, <0, 7, 1>, <7, 1, 3>.
Therefore the final answer is [10].
