Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in this graph.
The unique triangles are: 
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
