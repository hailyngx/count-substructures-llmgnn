Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [8].
