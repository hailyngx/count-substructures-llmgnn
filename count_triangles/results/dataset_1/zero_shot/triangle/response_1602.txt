Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 5>
<5, 6, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 15.  
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
