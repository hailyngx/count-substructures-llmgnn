Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. 

The triangles are:
<0, 3, 4>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
