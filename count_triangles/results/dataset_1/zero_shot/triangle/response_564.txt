Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph can be calculated using the number of triangles connected to each node:

Node 0: <0, 2, 5>
Node 1: <1, 4, 5>
Node 2: <2, 0, 8>
Node 3: <3, 4, 8>
Node 4: <4, 1, 5>
Node 5: <5, 0, 9>
Node 6: No triangles
Node 7: No triangles
Node 8: <8, 2, 3>
Node 9: <9, 0, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
