Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
