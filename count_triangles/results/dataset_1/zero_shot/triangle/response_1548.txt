Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>.
