Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [\<0, 1, 2\> <0, 1, 7> <0, 1, 8> <0, 1, 9> <0, 2, 6> <0, 2, 7> <0, 2, 8> <1, 2, 9> <1, 3, 7> <1, 4, 6> <1, 6, 9> <2, 6, 9> <5, 8, 9>]. So, the final answer is [13].
