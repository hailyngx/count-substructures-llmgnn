Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>
There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
