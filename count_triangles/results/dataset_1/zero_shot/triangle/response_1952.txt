Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be found by summing up the number of triangles each node is part of. Since calculating this manually can be quite complex for a large graph, we will consider an efficient approach.

In this case, we can use the fact that the number of triangles a node is part of is actually equal to the number of triangles formed by considering that node and its adjacent edges.

Let's now calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

Node 0 is part of 2 triangles: <0, 3, 9> and <0, 3, 8>.
Node 1 is not part of any triangle.
Node 2 is part of 2 triangles: <2, 3, 7> and <2, 6, 7>.
Node 3 is part of 3 triangles: <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 2>, and <2, 3, 7>.
Node 4 is not part of any triangle.
Node 5 is part of 2 triangles: <4, 5, 7> and <5, 6, 7>.
Node 6 is part of 2 triangles: <2, 6, 5> and <2, 6, 7>.
Node 7 is part of 4 triangles: <1, 7, 2>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 7, 5>, and <5, 6, 7>.
Node 8 is part of 1 triangle: <0, 8, 4>.
Node 9 is part of 1 triangle: <0, 3, 9>.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 19.

Therefore, the final answer is [19] triangles, which can be represented by the following unique triangles: <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 2>, <4, 7, 5>, <5, 6, 7>, and <0, 8, 4>.
