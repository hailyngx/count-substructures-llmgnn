Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula: 

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i} deg(v_i) \times (deg(v_i) - 1) \times (deg(v_i) - 2) - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i}[(\text{number of edges in the }i\text{th triangle}) - 2] \]

Using the given information, the degree sequence of the graph is:
\[ 4, 5, 2, 5, 2, 4, 2, 2, 3, 5 \]

Calculating the first term of the formula:
\[ \frac{1}{6} \times [(4 \times 3 \times 2) + (5 \times 4 \times 3) + (2 \times 1 \times 0) + (5 \times 4 \times 3) + (2 \times 1 \times 0) + (4 \times 3 \times 2) + (2 \times 1 \times 0) + (2 \times 1 \times 0) + (3 \times 2 \times 1) + (5 \times 4 \times 3)] = 80 \]

Calculating the second term of the formula (counting the number of triangles using the given edges):
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times [(3) + (2) + (1) + (4) + (2) + (0) + (0) + (2) + (4) + (2)] = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is:
\[ 80 - 10 = 70 \]

Now, let's list the unique triangles found:
\[ [ <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 9> ] \] 

Therefore, the final answer is: 
\[ [70] \]
