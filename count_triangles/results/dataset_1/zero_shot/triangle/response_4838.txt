Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] triangles in the given graph:
<3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
