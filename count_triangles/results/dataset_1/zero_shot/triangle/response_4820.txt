Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 --- 3 --- 7
   /|\    |   /
  / | \   |  /
 6  3  8  6
  \ |   \ | \
   \|    \|  \
    6 --- 3 --- 6
   /|\    |   /|
  / | \   |  / |
 4  0  9  1  2
```

There are 11 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 2>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 9, 0>

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
