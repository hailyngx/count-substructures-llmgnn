Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by summing up the number of triangles each node is a part of.

Looking at the given graph, here are the triangles present:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 6, 2>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<8, 6, 9>
<8, 6, 7>

Counting the number of triangles gives us a total of 9. Therefore, the answer is [9].
