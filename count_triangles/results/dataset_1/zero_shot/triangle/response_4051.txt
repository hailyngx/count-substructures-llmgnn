Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 8, 1>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 6>, <3, 7, 9>, <7, 6, 2>, <7, 6, 9>, <8, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
