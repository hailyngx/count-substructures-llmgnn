Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<5, 1, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
