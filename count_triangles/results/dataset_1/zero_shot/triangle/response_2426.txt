Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] triangles in the graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 9, 2>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 0, 8>
<5, 2, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
