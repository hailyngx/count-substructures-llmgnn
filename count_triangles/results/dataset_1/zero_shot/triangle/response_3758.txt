Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 5, 1>
<8, 4, 5> 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
