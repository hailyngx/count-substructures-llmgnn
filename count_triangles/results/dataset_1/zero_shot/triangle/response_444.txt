Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The unique triangles in this graph are:

<0, 1, 3>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
