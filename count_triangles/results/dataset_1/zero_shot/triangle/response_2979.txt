Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
