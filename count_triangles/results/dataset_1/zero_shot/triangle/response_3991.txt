Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 6.   
The unique triangles are:  
<0, 3, 4>  
<0, 4, 9>  
<3, 4, 5>  
<2, 4, 9>  
<2, 6, 9>  
<3, 4, 7>  

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
