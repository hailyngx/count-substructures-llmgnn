Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 8, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 5>
<7, 9, 3>
<7, 9, 1>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [8].
