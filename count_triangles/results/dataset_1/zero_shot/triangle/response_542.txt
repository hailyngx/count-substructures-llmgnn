Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 triangles in this graph. Below are the unique triangles that can be formed:

[<0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 9>]
