Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
