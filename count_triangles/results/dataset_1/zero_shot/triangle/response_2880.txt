Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<2, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 1>
<2, 8, 4>
<2, 8, 3>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 4>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 0, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
