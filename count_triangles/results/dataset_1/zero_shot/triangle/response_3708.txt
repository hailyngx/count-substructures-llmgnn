Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the graph.
The final answer is [5].
