Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: 

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 9, 3>
<4, 5, 0>
<4, 8, 7>
<5, 3, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
