Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 5>, <3, 6, 2>, <3, 7, 9>,

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
