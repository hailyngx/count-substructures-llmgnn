Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <1, 5, 6>
4. <4, 5, 6>
5. <5, 7, 9>
6. <6, 7, 9>
7. <8, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
