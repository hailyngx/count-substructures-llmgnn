Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of triangles each node is involved in and then dividing the sum by 3, as each triangle involves 3 nodes.

After analyzing the provided graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 2>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 8>

Counting each unique triangle once, there are 6 unique triangles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
