Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 24 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

[<1, 3, 4>, <4, 1, 5>, <6, 4, 5>, <5, 6, 9>, <7, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 3>, <3, 8, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <8, 0, 2>, <2, 7, 8>]
