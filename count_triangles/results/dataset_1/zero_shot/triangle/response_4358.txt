Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 8, 9>

There are total of [4] triangles in the graph.
