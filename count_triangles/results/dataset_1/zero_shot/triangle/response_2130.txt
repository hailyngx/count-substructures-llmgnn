Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 11 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 0, 4>
<3, 2, 4>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 0, 6>
<5, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
