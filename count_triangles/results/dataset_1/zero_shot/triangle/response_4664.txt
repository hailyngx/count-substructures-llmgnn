Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 1, 7>
<3, 2, 6>
<5, 4, 7>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in total.
