Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

[<0, 3, 9> <0, 4, 9> <0, 3, 4> <4, 5, 8> <8, 2, 4> <9, 6, 0>]

Number of triangles: [6]
