Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining every possible combination of three connected nodes. 

After examining all possible triangles in the graph, we find the following unique triangles: 
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
