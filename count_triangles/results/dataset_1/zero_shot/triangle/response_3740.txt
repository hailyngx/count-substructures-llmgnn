Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 2, 1>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 8, 5>
<4, 9, 4>
<7, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
