Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 7>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
