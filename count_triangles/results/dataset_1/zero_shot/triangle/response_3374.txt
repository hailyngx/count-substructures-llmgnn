Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 5>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 9, 4>, <2, 9, 3>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 9, 4>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
