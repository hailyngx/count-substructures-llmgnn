Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following unique triangles: <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 8>.
Thus, there are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
