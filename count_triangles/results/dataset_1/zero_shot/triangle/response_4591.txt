Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:

[<0, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <6, 1, 2>, <6, 3, 7>, <7, 8, 4>]
