Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
  0 -- 4 -- 2
  |    |    |
  6    7 -- 5 -- 9
             |    |
             8    |
                  3
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will need to identify all the unique triangles present. 
The triangles in this graph are:
<4, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
