Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<1, 6, 2>
<6, 8, 3>
<6, 9, 3>
<1, 7, 6>
<2, 5, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
