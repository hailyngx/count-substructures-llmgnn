Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 9, 7>, <0, 9, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 9, 7>, <4, 2, 5>, <4, 2, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <7, 6, 9>, <7, 9, 8>
There are 18 unique triangles in total. So, the final answer is [18].
