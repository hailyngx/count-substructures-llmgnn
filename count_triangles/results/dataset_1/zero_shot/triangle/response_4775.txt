Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles present in the given graph are:

<0, 2, 4>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [3].
