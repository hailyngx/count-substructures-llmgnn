Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

[<3, 4, 5>, <6, 7, 9>]

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in total.
