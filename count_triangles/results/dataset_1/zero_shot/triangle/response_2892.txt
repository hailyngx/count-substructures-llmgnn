Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by iterating through each unique triple of nodes and checking if there exists an edge between every pair of nodes in the triple. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 6>
<4, 3, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

There are 13 unique triangles in total. So, the answer is: [13].
