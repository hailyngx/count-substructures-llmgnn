Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is 2.

The unique triangles are <2, 5, 8> and <2, 9, 7>.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
