Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of closed loops of length 3, which represent triangles. Let's list down all the triangles in the graph:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
