Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are: 

<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<0, 3, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
