Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can form triangles when there are 3 nodes connected to each other. Let's find all the triangles in the graph:

Triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<6, 9, 7>
