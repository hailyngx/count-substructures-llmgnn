Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are <2, 0, 4>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, and <7, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
