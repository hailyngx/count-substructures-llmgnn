Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in this graph: <1, 4, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, and <4, 5, 8>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
