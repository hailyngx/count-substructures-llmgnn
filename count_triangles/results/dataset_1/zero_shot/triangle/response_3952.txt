Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 1>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the answer is [6].
