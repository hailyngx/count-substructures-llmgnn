Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 1, 8>
<3, 5, 3>
<8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
