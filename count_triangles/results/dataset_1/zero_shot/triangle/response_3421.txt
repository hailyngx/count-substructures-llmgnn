Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
