Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [16] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are <3, 0, 5>, <3, 2, 9>, <3, 8, 4>, <4, 9, 6>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 3>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 9, 4>, <8, 3, 4>, <8, 4, 9>, <8, 4, 9>, <1, 8, 3>, <1, 8, 7>, <9, 4, 6>.
