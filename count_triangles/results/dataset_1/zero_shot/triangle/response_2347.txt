Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of closed loops of length 3. In this graph, we can identify the following triangles:

<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
