Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by checking every combination of three nodes and confirming if they form a triangle. 

In this given graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, the triangles present are:
[<1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 5>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
