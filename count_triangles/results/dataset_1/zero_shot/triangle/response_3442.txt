Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 1     5 -- 2
|         / |     |
7 -- 6 -- 8 -- 3
|
    4
```

To count the number of triangles, we can search for all possible triangles in the graph. 

Upon inspection, we can find the following triangles:
1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 1 and 7.
2. Triangle involving nodes 0, 7 and 6.
3. Triangle involving nodes 0, 8 and 6.
4. Triangle involving nodes 0, 8 and 5.
5. Triangle involving nodes 5, 2 and 3.
6. Triangle involving nodes 5, 2 and 6.
7. Triangle involving nodes 5, 6 and 8.
8. Triangle involving nodes 5, 6 and 7.
9. Triangle involving nodes 6, 7 and 0.
10. Triangle involving nodes 6, 7 and 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is 10. 

Hence, the final answer is [10] with the unique triangles found as <0, 1, 7>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 5>, <5, 2, 3>, <5, 2, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 0>, <6, 7, 8>.
