Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in this graph. Here they are:

[<0, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 9, 5>] 

Therefore, the answer is [8].
