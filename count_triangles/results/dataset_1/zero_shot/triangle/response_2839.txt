Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be identified by counting the number of paths of length 2 between any three distinct nodes. To make this task easier, we can first list out all the triangles present in the graph:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
