Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 9, 6>, <6, 5, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>
There are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
