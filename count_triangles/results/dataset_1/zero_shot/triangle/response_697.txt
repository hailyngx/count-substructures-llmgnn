Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in this graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 3, 6>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
