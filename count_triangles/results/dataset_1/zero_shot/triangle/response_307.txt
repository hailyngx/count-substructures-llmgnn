Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:
```
    1 -- 7 -- 8
   / \   |  / | \
  9   2--0--9--6
   \ /       | /
    4 -------3--5
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected by edges. Let's go ahead and find the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 2, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
7. Triangle <3, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph, as listed above.
