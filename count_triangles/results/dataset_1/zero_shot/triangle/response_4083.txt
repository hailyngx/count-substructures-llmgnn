Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
<8, 9, 4>
<6, 3, 2>
<6, 7, 3>
<0, 9, 4>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
