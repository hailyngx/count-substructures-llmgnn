Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for closed loops of length 3. 

Let's determine the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle formed by nodes 2, 3, and 6: <2, 3, 6>
2. Triangle formed by nodes 4, 5, and 7: <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [2].
