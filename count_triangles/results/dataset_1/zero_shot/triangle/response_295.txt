Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, and <1, 5, 9>.

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
