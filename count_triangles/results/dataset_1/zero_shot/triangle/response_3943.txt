Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of closed loops of length 3. One way to do this is by considering each triplet of nodes and checking if they form a triangle. 

By examining the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 6, 5>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<8, 1, 9>
<8, 2, 4>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is 12, which can be represented as [12].
