Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, and <5, 7, 9>.
