Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
[<0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 4>] 

Total number of triangles: [2]
