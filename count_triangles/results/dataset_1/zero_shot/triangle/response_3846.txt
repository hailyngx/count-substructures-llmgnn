Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles: <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 8, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 2>  

There are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph.  
So, the final answer is [12].
