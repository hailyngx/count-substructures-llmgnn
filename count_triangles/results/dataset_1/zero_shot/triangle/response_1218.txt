Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by summing up the number of triangles each node is part of.

Calculating the number of triangles for each node:
- Node 0: 2 triangles (0, 2, 8) and (0, 2, 9)
- Node 1: 0 triangles
- Node 2: 4 triangles (2, 0, 8), (2, 0, 9), (2, 3, 8), and (2, 7, 8)
- Node 3: 1 triangle (3, 2, 8)
- Node 4: 3 triangles (4, 8, 9), (4, 6, 7), and (4, 8, 6)
- Node 5: 1 triangle (5, 3, 9)
- Node 6: 0 triangles
- Node 7: 0 triangles
- Node 8: 4 triangles (8, 0, 1), (8, 2, 0), (8, 2, 3), and (8, 4, 9)
- Node 9: 2 triangles (9, 0, 1) and (9, 4, 5)

Adding up the triangles from each node, we get a total of 17 triangles.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
