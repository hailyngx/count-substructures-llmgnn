Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 3, 4>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 3, 6>
<6, 2, 9>
<8, 5, 6>
<9, 0, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
