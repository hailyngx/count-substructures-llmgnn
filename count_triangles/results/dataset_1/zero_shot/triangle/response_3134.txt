Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:
```
   0 -- 2     3 -- 4
   |         / |    |
   9        6  |    |
             \ |    |
               5    7 -- 8
                     |
                     9
```

To count the number of triangles, we need to find all sets of three nodes connected by edges. After examining the graph, the unique triangles are:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <3, 4, 6>
3. <7, 8, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
