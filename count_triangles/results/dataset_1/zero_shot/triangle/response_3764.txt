Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of unique paths of length 2 between nodes. Let's go ahead and calculate the number of triangles in this graph.

Looking at the edges provided, let's list out the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 2>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 3>
5. Triangle <0, 8, 2>
6. Triangle <1, 2, 7>
7. Triangle <1, 3, 4>
8. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
9. Triangle <1, 7, 5>
10. Triangle <2, 7, 4>

Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles found. 

Total number of triangles: 10

Therefore, the answer is [10].
