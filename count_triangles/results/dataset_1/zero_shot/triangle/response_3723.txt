Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by examining the triangles formed by three connected nodes. 
Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<6, 1, 2>
<6, 2, 7>
<7, 4, 2>
<7, 4, 8>
<8, 4, 5>
