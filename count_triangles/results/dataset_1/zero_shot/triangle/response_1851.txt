Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of unique triangles formed by three connected nodes (vertices). To find the triangles in this graph, we need to look for combinations of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Upon examining the given edges in the graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [9].
