Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting all unique triangles formed by the nodes in the graph.

Let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 0, 4>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [4].
