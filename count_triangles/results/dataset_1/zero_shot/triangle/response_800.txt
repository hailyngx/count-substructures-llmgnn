Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed:

[<0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>]
