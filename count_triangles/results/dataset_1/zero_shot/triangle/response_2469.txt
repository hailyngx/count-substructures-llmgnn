Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, and <3, 7, 8>.
There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. Thus, the final answer is [5].
