Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph given can form the following triangles:
<1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>
There are 4 triangles in total. Hence, the final answer is [4].
