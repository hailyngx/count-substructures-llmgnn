Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges.

The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 8, 3>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 2>
<1, 7, 3>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 3>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 3>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 9, 2>

Count of triangles: [18]
