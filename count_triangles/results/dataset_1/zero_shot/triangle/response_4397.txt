Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated using the number of triangles each node participates in. Here is the count of triangles per node:

Node 0: 0 triangles
Node 1: 0 triangles
Node 2: 0 triangles
Node 3: 2 triangles
Node 4: 0 triangles
Node 5: 0 triangles
Node 6: 2 triangles
Node 7: 12 triangles
Node 8: 6 triangles
Node 9: 4 triangles

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is 26.
