Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in this graph is [6].
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 3>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, and <5, 6, 7>.
