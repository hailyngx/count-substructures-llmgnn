Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 1, 7>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
