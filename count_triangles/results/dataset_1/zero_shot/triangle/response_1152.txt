Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
    0 -- 3
  / |     |
5   |     |
  \ |     |
    2 -- 6
      \   /
        8 -- 9
        |   |
        4   |
           /
          /
         9
```

Using the given information, we can find the number of triangles and list them:

1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <2, 6, 8>
3. <8, 9, 4>
4. <8, 9, 4>
5. <8, 9, 4>

Hence, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
