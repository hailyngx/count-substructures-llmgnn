Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted using the number of triangles formula: 

\( \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{i} (d_{i}-1) (d_{i}-2) \)

where \( d_{i} \) is the degree of node i. 

Given the degrees of the nodes:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 1

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\( \frac{1}{6} [4(3)(2) + 2(1)(0) + 3(2)(1) + 4(3)(2) + 3(2)(1) + 5(4)(3) + 1(0)(-1) + 5(4)(3) + 4(3)(2) + 1(0)(-1)] \)

This simplifies to:

\( \frac{1}{6} [24 + 0 + 6 + 24 + 6 + 60 + 0 + 60 + 24 + 0] \)

Total number of triangles = 45

Hence, the answer is [45].
