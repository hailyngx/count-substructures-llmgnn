Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles: 

<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 8, 3>
<5, 3, 1>
<4, 5, 3>
<0, 9, 7>
<8, 9, 7>

There are a total of 10 triangles in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [10]
