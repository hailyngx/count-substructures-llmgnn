Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The unique triangles in the given graph are <0, 4, 8> and <0, 5, 9>. Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the graph.
