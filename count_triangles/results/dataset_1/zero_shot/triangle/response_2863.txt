Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 1>
<3, 0, 9>
<8, 2, 9>

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
