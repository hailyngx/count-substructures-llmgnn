Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
    1 -- 2
   /      \
  8        9
 /|\      /|\
0 | 3    0 | 2
 \|/      \|/
  4 -- 6 -- 4
   \   |   /
    \  |  /
       5
      / \
     7   8
```

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

There are 2 triangles:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
