Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 9>
<1, 7, 2>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>

There are a total of 6 triangles in this graph, so the answer is [6].
