Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 1, 8>, and <5, 8, 9>.
