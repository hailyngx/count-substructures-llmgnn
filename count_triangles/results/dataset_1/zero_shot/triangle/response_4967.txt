Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets:

[<0, 1, 4> <0, 3, 5> <2, 4, 8> <3, 5, 7> <3, 4, 8> <3, 7, 9>]
