Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 0>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 9, 6>
<0, 9, 8>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 7, 0>
<1, 7, 6>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 0>
<6, 7, 1>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 9, 0>
<6, 9, 8>
<7, 9, 0>
<7, 9, 6>
<8, 2, 3>
<8, 3, 6>
<8, 9, 0>

Therefore, there are 28 triangles in total. [<0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 0>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 9, 6>, <0, 9, 8>, <1, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 7, 0>, <1, 7, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 0>, <6, 7, 1>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 9, 0>, <6, 9, 8>, <7, 9, 0>, <7, 9, 6>, <8, 2, 3>, <8, 3, 6>, <8, 9, 0>]
