Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 0>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<8, 1, 5>
<8, 1, 9>

Therefore, there are 10 unique triangles in the graph. Hence, the final answer is [10].
