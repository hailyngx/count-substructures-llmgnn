Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed within brackets []:

[<0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 7>]
