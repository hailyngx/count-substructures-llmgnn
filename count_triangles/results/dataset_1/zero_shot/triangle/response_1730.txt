Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets and separated by commas:

\[<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 9>\]
