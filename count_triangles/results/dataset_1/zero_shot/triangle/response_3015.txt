Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:
```
    1 -- 2
   /      |
  6       4 -- 9
   \      |  /
    3 -- 5
         |
         9
```

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <4, 5, 9>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the graph.
