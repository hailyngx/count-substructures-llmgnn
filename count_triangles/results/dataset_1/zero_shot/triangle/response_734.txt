Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be formed using the following unique combinations of nodes:
<0, 1, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
