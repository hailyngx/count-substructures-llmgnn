Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
    1 -- 4
   / \    | \
  5 - 2 --3 - 8
  | /      |/
  6 ----- 7
  |
  9
```

To count the number of triangles, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in this graph: 
1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <3, 4, 7>
4. <3, 7, 8>
5. <3, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
