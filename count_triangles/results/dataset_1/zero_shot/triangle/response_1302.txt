Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 7, 6>
<2, 0, 3>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 7>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
