Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 64 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 2>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 8, 1>, <4, 8, 7>, <5, 1, 4>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 2, 4>, <5, 4, 1>, <5, 4, 2>, <5, 4, 7>, <5, 4, 7>, <5, 7, 4>, <5, 7, 6>, <6, 0, 7>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 4, 1>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 7, 0>, <7, 0, 6>, <7, 3, 4>, <7, 4, 3>, <7, 4, 5>, <7, 4, 6>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 5, 4>, <7, 6, 0>, <7, 6, 4>, <7, 6, 8>, <7, 8, 4>, <8, 1, 4>, <8, 4, 1>, <8, 4, 7>, <9, 0, 1>, <9, 1, 0>, <9, 1, 8>] 

Therefore, there are a total of [64] triangles in the graph.
