Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are total of [42] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles are: 
<1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>
