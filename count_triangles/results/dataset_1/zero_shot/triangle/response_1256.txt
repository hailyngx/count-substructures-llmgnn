Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 0, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 7, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
