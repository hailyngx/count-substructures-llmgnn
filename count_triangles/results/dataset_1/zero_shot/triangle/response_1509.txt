Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 7, 6>, <5, 8, 3>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
