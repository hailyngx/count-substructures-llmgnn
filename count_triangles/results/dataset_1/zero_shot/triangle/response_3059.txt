Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by computing the number of unique triangles each node participates in.

The triangles found in the given graph are:  
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 8, 5>, <3, 5, 8>, <7, 4, 6>, <7, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
