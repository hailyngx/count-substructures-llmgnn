Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
