Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of triangles each node is part of and summing them up. 

Considering the given graph, the triangles can be represented as follows:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 8, 7>
- Triangle 4: <2, 1, 4>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 6: <2, 9, 5>
- Triangle 7: <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle 8: <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle 9: <7, 8, 9>

Hence, there are 9 unique triangles in total. So, the final answer is [9].
