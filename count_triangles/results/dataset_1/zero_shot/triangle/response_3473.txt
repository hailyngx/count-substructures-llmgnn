Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [9].
