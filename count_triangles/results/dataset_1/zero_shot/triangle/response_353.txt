Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by examining all possible triangles formed by the 10 nodes.

Upon analyzing the provided edges, the unique triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 0, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
