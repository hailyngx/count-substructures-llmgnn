Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the nodes and edges given.

Looking at the edges provided, we can see that the triangle <5, 7, 8> is formed by the edges (7, 5), (7, 8), and (8, 5).

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
