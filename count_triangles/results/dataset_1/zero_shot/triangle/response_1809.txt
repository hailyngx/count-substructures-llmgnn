Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<0, 3, 2>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 8, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 5>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 0>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 7>

Therefore, there are 29 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [29].
