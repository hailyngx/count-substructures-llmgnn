Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<6, 1, 3>
<6, 3, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 3, 6>
<7, 8, 2>
<7, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
