Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 7, 9>
5. <1, 8, 9>
6. <2, 4, 9>
7. <4, 7, 9>
8. <4, 5, 9>
9. <7, 4, 9>
10. <9, 4, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the graph.  
The final answer is [10].
