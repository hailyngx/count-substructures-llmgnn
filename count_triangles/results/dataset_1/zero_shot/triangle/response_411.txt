Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 8, 4>, <4, 9, 1>, <4, 8, 9>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
