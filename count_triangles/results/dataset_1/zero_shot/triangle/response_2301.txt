Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be determined by finding all the unique combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges. 

After examining the given edges, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 9>

So, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
