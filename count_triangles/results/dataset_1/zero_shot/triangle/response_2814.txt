Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles found in this graph: <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
