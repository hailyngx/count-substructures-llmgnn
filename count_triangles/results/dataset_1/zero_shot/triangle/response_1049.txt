Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 8> and <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
