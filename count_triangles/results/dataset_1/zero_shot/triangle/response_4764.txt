Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>.
