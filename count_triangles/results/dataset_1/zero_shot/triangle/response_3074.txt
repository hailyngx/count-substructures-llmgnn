Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by the nodes.

After analyzing the provided edges, the triangles identified in the graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
