Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 13 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 9, 4>
<1, 0, 7>
<1, 9, 4>
<2, 0, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 0, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 9, 0>
<5, 4, 7>

So, the total number of triangles is [13].
