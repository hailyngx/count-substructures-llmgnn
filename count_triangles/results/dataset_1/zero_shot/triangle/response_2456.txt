Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
