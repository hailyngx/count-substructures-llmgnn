Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<3, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 1>
<9, 1, 7>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
