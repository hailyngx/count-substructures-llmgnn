Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

\[ \binom{10}{3} = 120 \]

Now, we will count the unique triangles present in the graph provided.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is: [8].
