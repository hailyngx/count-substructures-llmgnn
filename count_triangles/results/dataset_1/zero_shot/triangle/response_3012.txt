Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles present in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
