Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 14 triangles in the graph. The unique triangles are <2, 1, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 7, 4>, <3, 8, 2>, <3, 9, 6>, <7, 6, 4>, <8, 3, 2>, <0, 2, 1>.
Therefore, the final answer is [14].
