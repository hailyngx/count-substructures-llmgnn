Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in total.
