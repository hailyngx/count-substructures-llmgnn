Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
The unique triangles found are <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 3>.
