Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the graph are formed by nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles and count them:

<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 9>

So, there are a total of 10 unique triangles in the graph. Therefore, the answer is [10].
