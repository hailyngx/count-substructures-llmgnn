Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the graph are:
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <7, 6, 8>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
