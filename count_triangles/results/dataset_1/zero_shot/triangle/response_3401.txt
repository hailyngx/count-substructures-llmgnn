Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Here are the triangles that can be found in the graph:

<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 7>

There are a total of 3 triangles in the given graph. 
Thus, the number of triangles in the graph is [3].
