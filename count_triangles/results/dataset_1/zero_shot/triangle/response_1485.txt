Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following edges:
- 0, 4
- 1, 2
- 1, 3
- 1, 8
- 2, 1
- 2, 9
- 3, 1
- 3, 9
- 4, 0
- 4, 8
- 5, 7
- 6, 8
- 7, 5
- 8, 1
- 8, 4
- 8, 6
- 9, 2
- 9, 3

Counting the number of triangles in the graph, we find that there are 2 triangles. The unique triangles are:
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 8, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
