Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 3>
<7, 9, 0>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
