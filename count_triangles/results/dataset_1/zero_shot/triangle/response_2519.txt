Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After validating the graph, we find that the triangles in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
