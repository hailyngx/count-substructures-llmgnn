Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. Let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

A triangle is formed by 3 nodes connected by 3 edges to each other. 

By observing the given edges list, we can find the following unique triangles in the graph:
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 3>
<1, 6, 2>
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 3, 5>
<5, 2, 6>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
