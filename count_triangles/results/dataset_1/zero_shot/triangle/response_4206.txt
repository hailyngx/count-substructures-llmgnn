Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
