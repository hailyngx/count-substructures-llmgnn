Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be calculated by examining the number of triangles each node can form. The answer is as follows:

\[ \text{Total number of triangles} = \left[\binom{10}{3} + 10 \times \text{Number of triangles each node is involved in}\right] \]

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 3, and 5. Hence, the triangles are <0, 1, 3> and <0, 1, 5>.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8. Hence, the triangles are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, and <0, 1, 8>.
3. Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 5 and 8. Hence, the triangle is <5, 2, 8>.
4. Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8. Hence, the triangles are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, and <0, 3, 8>.
5. Node 4 forms a triangle with node 7. Hence, the triangle is <4, 7, 9>.
6. Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 8. Hence, the triangles are <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 7>, and <0, 5, 8>.
7. Node 6 forms a triangle with node 1. Hence, the triangle is <1, 6, 7>.
8. Node 7 forms triangles with nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9. Hence, the triangles are <1, 7, 3>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 5>, and <1, 7, 8>.
9. Node 8 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5. Hence, the triangles are <1, 8, 2>, <1, 8, 3>, <1, 8, 5>, and <1, 8, 7>.
10. Node 9 forms a triangle with node 7. Hence, the triangle is <4, 7, 9>.

Calculating the total number of triangles:

\[ \text{Total number of triangles} = \left[\binom{10}{3} + 10 \times 10\right] = [120 + 100] = [220] \]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 220.
