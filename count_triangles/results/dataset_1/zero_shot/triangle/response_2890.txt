Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, and <2, 7, 8>.

Count of triangles: [7]
