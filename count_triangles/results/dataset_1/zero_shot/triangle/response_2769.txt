Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the answer is [8].
