Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i} d_{i} (d_{i} - 1) (d_{i} - 2) \]

Where \(d_{i}\) represents the degree of the \(i^{th}\) vertex.

From the given graph, we can list the degrees of each vertex:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 1
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 3

Now we can calculate the number of triangles using the formula. After doing the calculations, we find that the graph contains 7 triangles.

Therefore, the final answer is: 
[<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <8, 9, 5>]
