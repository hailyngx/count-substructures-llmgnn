Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by examining all possible combinations of three nodes that form a triangle. 

After analyzing the given graph, the unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
