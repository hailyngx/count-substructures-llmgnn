Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph described can form several triangles. Let's identify and count them:

Triangles:
<2, 0, 4>
<2, 0, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 1, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<6, 0, 4>
<6, 1, 4>
<6, 1, 3>
<6, 2, 0>
<6, 2, 4>
<6, 3, 1>
<6, 3, 9>
<6, 4, 0>
<6, 7, 5>
<8, 2, 9>
<8, 3, 9>
<9, 3, 4>

Total number of triangles: 17
