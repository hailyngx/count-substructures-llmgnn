Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<2, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the graph.
