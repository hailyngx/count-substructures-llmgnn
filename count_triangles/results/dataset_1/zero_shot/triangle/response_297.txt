Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows: <2, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>. [12]
