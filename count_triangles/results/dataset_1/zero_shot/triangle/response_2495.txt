Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 22 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 1, 8>, <0, 8, 2>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 8, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <4, 3, 7>, <4, 3, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 4, 9>, <7, 3, 9>]
