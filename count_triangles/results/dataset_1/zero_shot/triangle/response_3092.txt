Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by summing up the number of triangles each node can be a part of. Since each triangle is made up of 3 nodes, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed with a specific node is the number of ways two edges can be drawn from that node. 

By counting the triangles, we find the following unique triangles:

<0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 2, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 5, 7>

Counting these unique triangles, we get 13 triangles in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
