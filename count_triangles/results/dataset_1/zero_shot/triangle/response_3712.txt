Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 9>

Therefore, the answer is [6].
