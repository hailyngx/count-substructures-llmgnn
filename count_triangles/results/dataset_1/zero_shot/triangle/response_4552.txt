Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles formed by the existing edges.

Upon examining the graph, we can list the unique triangles as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 9, 4>, <0, 9, 5>, <0, 9, 6>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 9, 5>, <4, 9, 6>, <4, 9, 8>, <5, 9, 6>, <7, 3, 4>, <7, 4, 9>, <8, 1, 9>, <8, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 6>, <9, 5, 6>.

Counting the unique triangles, the answer is [32].
