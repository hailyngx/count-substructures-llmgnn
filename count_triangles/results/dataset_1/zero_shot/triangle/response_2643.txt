Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the unique triangles formed by 3 nodes.

By examining the provided edges, we can determine the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
