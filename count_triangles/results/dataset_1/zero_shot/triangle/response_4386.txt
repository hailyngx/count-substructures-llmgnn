Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The following triangles are present in the given graph: 

<0, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
