Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by the connected nodes. 

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 9, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 8, 3>
<3, 6, 8>
<7, 5, 9>
[The total number of triangles in the graph is 11]
