Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are: <0, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, and <5, 1, 8>.
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
