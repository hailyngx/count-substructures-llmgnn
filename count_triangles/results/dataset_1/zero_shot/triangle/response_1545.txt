Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted based on the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
