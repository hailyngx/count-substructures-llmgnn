Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, 2, 4>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 0>
<6, 7, 0>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
