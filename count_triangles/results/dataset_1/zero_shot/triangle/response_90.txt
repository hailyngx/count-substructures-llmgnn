Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <7, 8, 9>

So, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
