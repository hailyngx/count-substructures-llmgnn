Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [16] triangles in this graph.  
The unique triangles are <0, 7, 3>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 9, 3>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 3>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 9, 3>, <7, 0, 4>, <7, 3, 5>, <9, 2, 3>, <9, 3, 4>.
