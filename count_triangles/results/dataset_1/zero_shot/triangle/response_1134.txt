Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles present in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
