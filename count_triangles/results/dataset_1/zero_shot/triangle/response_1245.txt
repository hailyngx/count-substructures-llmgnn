Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<2, 5, 3>, <2, 9, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [4]
