Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 0, 5>, <6, 4, 9>, <8, 2, 9>
Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
