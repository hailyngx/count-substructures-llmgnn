Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, and <3, 4, 8>. There are a total of 7 triangles in the graph. So, the final answer is [7].
