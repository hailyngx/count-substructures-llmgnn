Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
