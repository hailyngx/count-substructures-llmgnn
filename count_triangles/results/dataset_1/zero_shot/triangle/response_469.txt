Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangle in the given graph is formed by the nodes that are connected in such a way that they form a closed loop. Let's find the triangles in the graph: 

<0, 3, 1>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 5>
<2, 6, 1>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 3>
<2, 7, 1>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 1, 6>
<3, 1, 7>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 5>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 8, 0>
<4, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 8, 9>
<4, 9, 0>
<4, 9, 5>
<5, 1, 6>
<5, 1, 9>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 7, 1>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 1, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

There are 44 unique triangles present in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [44].
