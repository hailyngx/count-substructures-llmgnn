Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
