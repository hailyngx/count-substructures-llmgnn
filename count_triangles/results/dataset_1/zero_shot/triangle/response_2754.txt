Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

First, we need to find all the triangles in the graph based on the given edges:

1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <3, 4, 6>
3. <3, 4, 8>
4. <3, 6, 8>
5. <4, 6, 7>
6. <4, 6, 8>
7. <6, 7, 8>
8. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 8.

So, the final answer is [8].
