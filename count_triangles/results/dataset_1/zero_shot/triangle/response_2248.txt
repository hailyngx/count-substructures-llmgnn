Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a simple graph can be calculated using the formula: 
\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i} \text{degree}(v_i) (\text{degree}(v_i) - 1) (\text{degree}(v_i) - 2) \]

Let's find the number of triangles in this graph. We'll list the unique triangles as we count them.

\[ \text{Number of triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \left( 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 4^3 + 4^3 + 3^3 + 3^3 + 5^3 + 2^3 + 4^3 \right) = 96 \]

So, there are 96 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are: 
<0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 6>, <8, 3, 4>, <8, 3, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is [96].
