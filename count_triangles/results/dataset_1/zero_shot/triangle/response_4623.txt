Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <2, 3, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, and <4, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
