Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be determined by calculating the number of triangles each vertex is involved in and dividing by 6. 

For this graph, the triangles are: 
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 3, 9>
<5, 9, 7>

Count the total number of triangles:
12 triangles

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
