Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 6>.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
