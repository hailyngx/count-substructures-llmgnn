Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of the unique triangles:
[<1, 0, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <7, 9, 5>] 
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
