Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 -- 2
    |    | \
    |    |  8
    |    | /
    3 -- 4 -- 9
       / |    |
      5  8    7
       \ |    |
         6 ---/
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected. Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <3, 4, 5>
4. <3, 5, 8>
5. <4, 5, 8>
6. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [6].
