Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 1, 2>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
