Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 8, 3>
<1, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in total.  
The answer is [3].
