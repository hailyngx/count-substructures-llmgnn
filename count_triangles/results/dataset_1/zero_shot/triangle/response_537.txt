Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for loops of size 3 among the nodes. 

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 7, 5>
<6, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
