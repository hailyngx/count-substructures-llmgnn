Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, and <6, 7, 8>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
