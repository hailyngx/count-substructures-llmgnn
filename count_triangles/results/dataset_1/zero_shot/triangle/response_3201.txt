Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
