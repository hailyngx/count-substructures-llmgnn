Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
