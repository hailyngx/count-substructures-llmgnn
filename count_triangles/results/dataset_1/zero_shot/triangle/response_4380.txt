Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by examining each possible combination of three nodes connected by edges. In this case, we need to find all sets of three nodes that form a triangle with edges connecting all three of them.

Let's determine the triangles present in this graph:
1. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
3. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <3, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <3, 6, 8>
6. Triangle <4, 1, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
