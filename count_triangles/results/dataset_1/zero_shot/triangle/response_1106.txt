Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, and <0, 2, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
