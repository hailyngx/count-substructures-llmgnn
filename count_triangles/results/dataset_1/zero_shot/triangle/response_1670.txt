Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 0, 5>
<2, 0, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<5, 3, 6>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 6>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 4>
<6, 7, 5>
<7, 6, 5>
<7, 5, 8>
<8, 0, 5>

So, there are [20] triangles in this graph.
