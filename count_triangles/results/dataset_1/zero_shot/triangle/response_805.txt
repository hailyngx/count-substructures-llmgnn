Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 9, 6>
<9, 8, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
