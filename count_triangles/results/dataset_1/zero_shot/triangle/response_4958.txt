Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 8, 3>, <5, 6, 7>, <8, 1, 2>, <8, 9, 6> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
