Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by identifying all unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 5, 6>
2.  <0, 5, 9>
3.  <0, 6, 9>
4.  <1, 6, 7>
5.  <2, 4, 9>
6.  <2, 6, 9>
7.  <3, 4, 5>
8.  <4, 5, 6>
9.  <4, 5, 9>
10.  <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
