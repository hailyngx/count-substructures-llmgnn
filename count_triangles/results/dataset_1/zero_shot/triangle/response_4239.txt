Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
[<0, 2, 4> <0, 4, 8> <1, 4, 7> <3, 5, 8> <7, 6, 5>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
