Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by identifying all the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

There are 9 triangles in the graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 7, 4>, <5, 6, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
