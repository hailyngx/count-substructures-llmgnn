Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 1, 7>
<5, 0, 4>
<8, 0, 3>
<8, 3, 9>
<9, 7, 1>
<9, 8, 0>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 9, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<5, 4, 0>

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
