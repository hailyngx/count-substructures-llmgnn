Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be found by identifying all possible triangles formed by unique combinations of nodes connected by edges. Let's list out the triangles in the graph:

<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 9, 3>
<7, 9, 3>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. The answer is [10].
