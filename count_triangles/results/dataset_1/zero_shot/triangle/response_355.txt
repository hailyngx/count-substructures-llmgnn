Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 21 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 7, 9>, <0, 9, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <8, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [21].
