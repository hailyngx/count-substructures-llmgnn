Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 9, 8>, <2, 1, 4>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 4, 1>, <6, 7, 4>, <8, 2, 1>, <8, 6, 7>, <8, 6, 4>, <8, 9, 1>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [12].
