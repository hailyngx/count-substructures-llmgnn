Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>.
