Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of closed loops of length 3 in the graph. 

Let's determine the triangles in the given graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle 2: <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle 3: <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle 4: <1, 3, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle 6: <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle 7: <3, 8, 9>
- Triangle 8: <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 8. 

So, the final answer is [8].
