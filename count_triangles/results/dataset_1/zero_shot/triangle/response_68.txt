Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 14 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
<[0, 4, 2]>, <[0, 4, 5]>, <[0, 5, 3]>, <[0, 7, 3]>, <[1, 6, 7]>, <[2, 4, 0]>, <[2, 4, 8]>, <[3, 5, 9]>, <[3, 7, 0]>, <[3, 7, 8]>, <[3, 7, 9]>, <[4, 0, 5]>, <[7, 6, 1]>, <[7, 8, 3]>.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
