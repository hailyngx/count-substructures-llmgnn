Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<7, 1, 4>
<7, 6, 9>
<8, 3, 5>
<8, 6, 9>
<8, 7, 9>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
