Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 14 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 4>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 1, 7>, <4, 1, 8>, <6, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 1, 9>, <7, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
