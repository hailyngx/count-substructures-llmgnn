Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. So the answer is [4].
