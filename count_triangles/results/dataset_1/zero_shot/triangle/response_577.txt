Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by determining the number of paths of length 2 between each node. To count the number of triangles in this specific graph, we can analyze all possible triangles. 

Let's list the triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <1, 5, 4>
4. <1, 6, 3>
5. <1, 6, 7>
6. <1, 6, 9>
7. <2, 4, 5>
8. <2, 4, 6>
9. <2, 4, 7>
10. <2, 4, 9>
11. <2, 6, 3>
12. <2, 6, 7>
13. <2, 6, 9>
14. <3, 6, 7>
15. <4, 6, 7>
16. <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [16].
