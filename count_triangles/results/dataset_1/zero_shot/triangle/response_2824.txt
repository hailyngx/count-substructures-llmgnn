Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here they are listed within <> brackets:
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 7, 2>
<1, 6, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
