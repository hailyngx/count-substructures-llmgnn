Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
