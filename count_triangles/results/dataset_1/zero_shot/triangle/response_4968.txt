Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 8, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 0>
<4, 6, 1>
<6, 7, 1>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 9, 1>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
