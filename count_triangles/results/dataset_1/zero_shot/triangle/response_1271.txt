Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, the number of triangles in the graph can be calculated.

The triangles in the graph are:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>

There are a total of 7 unique triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
