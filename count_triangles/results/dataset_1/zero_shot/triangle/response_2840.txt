Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<7, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the graph. So, the final answer is [5].
