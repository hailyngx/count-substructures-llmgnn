Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 8>.
