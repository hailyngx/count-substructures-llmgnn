Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph.
Thus, the answer is [6].
The unique triangles are <3, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <5, 4, 3>, <4, 6, 3>.
