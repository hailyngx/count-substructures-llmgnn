Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles present in the given graph are as follows:

<2, 6, 5>
<9, 0, 3>
<9, 0, 4>
<9, 3, 4>
<9, 4, 5>
<9, 5, 6>
<9, 2, 6>
<9, 2, 8>
<9, 2, 3>
<5, 6, 2>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 4, 9>
<6, 5, 9>
<6, 2, 8>
<2, 6, 5>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
