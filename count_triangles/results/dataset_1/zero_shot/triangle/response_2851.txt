Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph.  

The triangles are:  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 4, 6>  
<0, 5, 7>  
<1, 4, 6>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
