Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 9>
There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [4].
