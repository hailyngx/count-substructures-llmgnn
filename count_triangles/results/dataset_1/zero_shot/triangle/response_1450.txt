Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 9, 2>
- <4, 7, 5>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <7, 2, 9>
- <9, 6, 5>
- <9, 6, 4>
- <9, 8, 4>

There are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
