Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 8>

Hence, there are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
