Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, 2, 4>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
