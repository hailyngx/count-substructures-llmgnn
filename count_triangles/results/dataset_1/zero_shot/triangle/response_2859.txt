Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 15 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<2, 0, 6>, <2, 1, 8>, <3, 1, 9>, <4, 3, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 0, 4>, <8, 1, 9>, <8, 4, 6>, <8, 7, 9>, <9, 2, 3>, <9, 5, 6>, <1, 2, 0>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 9, 5>, <6, 5, 9>]
