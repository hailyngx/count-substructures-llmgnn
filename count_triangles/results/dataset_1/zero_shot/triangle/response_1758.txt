Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph: <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>.
