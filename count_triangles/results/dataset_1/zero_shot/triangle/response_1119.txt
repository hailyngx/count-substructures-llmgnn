Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by 3 nodes. Let's list them out:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
