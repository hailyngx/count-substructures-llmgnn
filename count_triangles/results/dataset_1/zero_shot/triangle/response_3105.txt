Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
[<2, 4, 5>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <6, 8, 9>] 
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
