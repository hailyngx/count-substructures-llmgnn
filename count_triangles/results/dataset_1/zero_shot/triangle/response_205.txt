Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<3, 7, 0>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 2>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 9, 4>, <6, 9, 3>, <6, 9, 7>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
