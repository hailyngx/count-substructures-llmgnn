Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles found in the given graph are: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 8, 7>, <2, 8, 3>, <2, 8, 4>, <8, 3, 4>

There are 8 triangles in total.  
Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [8].
