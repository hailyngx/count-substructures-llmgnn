Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by identifying the triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. 
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 6>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 3>
<0, 9, 6>
<0, 9, 7>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 7, 6>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 6>
<2, 8, 7>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
  
Therefore, there are 31 triangles in the given graph.
