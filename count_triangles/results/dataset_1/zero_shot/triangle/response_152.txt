Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 9, 0>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 1, 5>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 8, 4>, <4, 1, 8>, <8, 7, 8>.
