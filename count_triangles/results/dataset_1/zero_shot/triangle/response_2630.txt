Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 9>, <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the graph.
