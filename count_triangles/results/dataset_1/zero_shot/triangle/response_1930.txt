Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph consists of the following triangles:
<3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 5>  <3, 6, 9>, <3, 9, 5>, <3, 9, 6>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 9, 6>
Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total.
