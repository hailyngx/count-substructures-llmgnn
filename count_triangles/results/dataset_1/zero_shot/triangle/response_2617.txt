Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 9, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 1, 4>
<5, 1, 6>
<5, 6, 2>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 5, 6>
<8, 0, 9>
<8, 0, 7>
<8, 1, 4>
<9, 0, 7>
<9, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
