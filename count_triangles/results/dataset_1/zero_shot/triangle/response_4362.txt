Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
