Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found:

[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>]
