Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be summarized as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to node 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4.

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we will list out the unique triangles:
<2, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 1, 9>, <3, 7, 5>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
