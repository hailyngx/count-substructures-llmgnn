Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 2    8
|    |        
4    3 -- 6 -- 9
     |    |     
     7    8     
```

Therefore, the triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>
<3, 4, 6>
<6, 8, 9>

There are a total of [3] triangles.
