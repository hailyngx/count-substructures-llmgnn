Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:

<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 3, 8>

Thus, the final answer is [6].
