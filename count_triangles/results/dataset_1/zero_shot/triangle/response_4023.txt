Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 0, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<6, 5, 9>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
