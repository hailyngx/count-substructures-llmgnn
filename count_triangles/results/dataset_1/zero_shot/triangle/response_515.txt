Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of triangles each node participates in and dividing by 6 because each triangle is counted 6 times (once for each of the 3 nodes). Let's calculate this now.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 9, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 2, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <8, 7, 9>

Counting the number of times each node participates in a triangle:
- Node 0 participates in 2 triangles
- Node 1 participates in 4 triangles
- Node 2 participates in 2 triangles
- Node 3 participates in 1 triangle
- Node 4 participates in 2 triangles
- Node 5 participates in 3 triangles
- Node 6 participates in 3 triangles
- Node 7 participates in 2 triangles
- Node 8 participates in 4 triangles
- Node 9 participates in 5 triangles

Adding the participation counts above, we get: 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 28

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is 28 / 6 = 4 full triangles and the fifth triangle using node 5, 6, and 9. Hence, the final answer is [5].
