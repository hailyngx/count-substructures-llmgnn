Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:  

<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 5, 2>  
<0, 3, 8>  
<3, 5, 2>  
<3, 5, 8>  
<3, 4, 8>  
<8, 4, 7>  
<9, 7, 8>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
