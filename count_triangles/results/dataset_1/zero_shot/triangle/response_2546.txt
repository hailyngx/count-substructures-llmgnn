Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
In this graph, there are 8 triangles. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 2, 4> <0, 4, 7> <1, 3, 7> <1, 4, 7> <2, 3, 9> <3, 4, 7> <4, 6, 8> <5, 6, 9>]
