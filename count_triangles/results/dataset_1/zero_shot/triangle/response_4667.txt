Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 8, 4>, and <4, 9, 5>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
