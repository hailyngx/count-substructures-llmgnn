Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in a graph can be counted by examining each set of 3 nodes and checking if each pair of nodes is connected by an edge.

Upon examining the given graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
