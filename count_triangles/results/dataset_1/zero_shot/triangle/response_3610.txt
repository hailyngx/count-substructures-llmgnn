Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by nodes that are connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
