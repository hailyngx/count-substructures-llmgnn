Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph described in the input has 9 triangles. 
The triangles are: 
<2, 3, 4>, 
<2, 4, 8>, 
<2, 4, 9>, 
<2, 6, 8>, 
<2, 6, 9>, 
<3, 4, 9>, 
<4, 7, 9>, 
<6, 7, 9>, 
<6, 8, 9>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
