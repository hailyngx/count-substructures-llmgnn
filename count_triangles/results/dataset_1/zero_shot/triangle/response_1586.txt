Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the graph. So the final answer is [9].
