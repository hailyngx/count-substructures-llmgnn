Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by the given edges. 

By analyzing the provided edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 2>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 9, 3>
<7, 0, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
