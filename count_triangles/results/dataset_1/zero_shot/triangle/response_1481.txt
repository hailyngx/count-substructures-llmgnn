Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph given consists of the following edges:
- (0, 5)
- (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)
- (2, 4), (2, 8)
- (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 9)
- (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9)
- (5, 0)
- (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9)
- (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 8)
- (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 7)
- (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6)

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can look for unique triangles by checking each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle (i.e., if each pair of nodes in the triplet is connected by an edge).

By examining the given edges, the triangles in the graph are:
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>

Hence, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
