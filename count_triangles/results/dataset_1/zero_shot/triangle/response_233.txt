Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 9, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
