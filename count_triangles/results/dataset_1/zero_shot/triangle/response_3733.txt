Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 0>
<1, 8, 5>
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 3, 6>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
