Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles are <0, 1, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, and <4, 5, 8>.
