Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be counted as follows:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 1, 5>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 3, 5>
4. Triangle 4: <1, 3, 8>
5. Triangle 5: <7, 4, 5>
6. Triangle 6: <8, 1, 3>
7. Triangle 7: <8, 1, 5>
8. Triangle 8: <8, 3, 1>
9. Triangle 9: <8, 3, 9>
10. Triangle 10: <8, 5, 1>

Thus, there are 10 triangles in the given graph as counted above. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
