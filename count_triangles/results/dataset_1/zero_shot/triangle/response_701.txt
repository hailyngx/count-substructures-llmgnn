Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<1, 7, 2>
<1, 7, 8>
<6, 2, 7>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
