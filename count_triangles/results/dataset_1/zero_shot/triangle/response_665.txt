Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <1, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 7, 8>.
