Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

[<0, 2, 4> <0, 4, 9> <2, 4, 8> <2, 8, 9> <2, 3, 7> <4, 8, 9> <4, 5, 9> <8, 9, 1>]
