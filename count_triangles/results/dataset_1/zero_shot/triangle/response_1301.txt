Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 

<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
