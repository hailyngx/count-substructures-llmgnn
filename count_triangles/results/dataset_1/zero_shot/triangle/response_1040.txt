Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 16 unique triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:

<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<5, 7, 4>
<9, 8, 1>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 9, 6>
<8, 9, 0>
<3, 9, 6>
<7, 5, 2>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [16].
