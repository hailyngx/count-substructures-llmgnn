Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

    0--2--6
    |  |  |
    9--1--4--8--7
       |  |  |
       5--3

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 4>, <3, 8, 9>
