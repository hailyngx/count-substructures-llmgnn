Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of unique paths of length 2 between three distinct nodes. Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

Looking at the given edges, the triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 0, 5>
<4, 0, 6>
<4, 1, 7>
<5, 3, 7>
<6, 4, 9>
<7, 1, 2>
<7, 1, 8>
<7, 2, 9>
<7, 5, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
