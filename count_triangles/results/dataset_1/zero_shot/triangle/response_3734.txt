Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by counting the unique combinations of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

From the given edges, the triangles are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 6>, <2, 3, 7>
 
Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the graph: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 6>, <2, 3, 7>.
