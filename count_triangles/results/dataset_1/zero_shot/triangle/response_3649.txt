Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<1, 2, 4>
<3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [2].
