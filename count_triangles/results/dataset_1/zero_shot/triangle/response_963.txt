Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding the number of closed loops of length 3. Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 2, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
