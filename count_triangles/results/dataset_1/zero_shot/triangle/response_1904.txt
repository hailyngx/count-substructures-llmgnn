Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 4>
<4, 3, 1>
<4, 3, 7>
<4, 3, 8>
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 5, 9>
<6, 9, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 11 triangles in the graph. So, the final answer is [11].
