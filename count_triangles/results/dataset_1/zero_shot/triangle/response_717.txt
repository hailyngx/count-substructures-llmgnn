Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles: <2, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 8>.
    
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
