Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 3>
<1, 8, 7>
<1, 9, 2>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 1>
<7, 8, 5>
<7, 9, 1>
<7, 9, 2>
There are a total of [13] triangles in the graph.
