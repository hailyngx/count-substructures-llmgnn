Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 7>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the graph.
Therefore, the answer is [6].
