Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 7, 3>, <1, 4, 2>, <3, 2, 4>, <8, 9, 3>.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
