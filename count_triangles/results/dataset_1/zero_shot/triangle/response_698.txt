Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7)
(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 9)
(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8)
(3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5)
(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7)
(7, 0), (7, 5)
(8, 2), (8, 9)
(9, 1), (9, 8)

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all possible cycles of length 3 among the nodes. Let's list the triangles:

<0, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 5>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [2].
