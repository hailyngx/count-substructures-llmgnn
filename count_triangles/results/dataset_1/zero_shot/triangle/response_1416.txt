Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. 

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

Upon examining the given edge list, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 9, 5>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, and <6, 1, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
