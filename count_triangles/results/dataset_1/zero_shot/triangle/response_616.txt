Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
```
    0 -- 6 -- 7 -- 2 -- 9
    |         |    |    |
    9         1 -- 4 -- 2
              |    |
              8    5
```

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to find all the unique sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.  

After examining the graph, we find the following triangle:
<1, 4, 6>

Therefore, the answer is [1].
