Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 -- 2 -- 6 -- 4
|    |    |    |
3 -- 5 -- 7    |
|         |    |
8---------9----1
```

After analyzing the graph, the number of triangles in the graph is 18. Here are the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 5>, <4, 7, 9>, <7, 5, 9>, <8, 6, 9>, <9, 6, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
