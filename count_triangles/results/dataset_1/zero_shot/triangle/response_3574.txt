Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<3, 0, 5>
<8, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the graph.
