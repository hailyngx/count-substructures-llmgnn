Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
[<0, 3, 5> <4, 6, 8> <4, 9, 7> <4, 6, 8> <4, 6, 9>]  
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
