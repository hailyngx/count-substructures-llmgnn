Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 9, 6>
<4, 7, 2>
<8, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 8. So the final answer is [8].
