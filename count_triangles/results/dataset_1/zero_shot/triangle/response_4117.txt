Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

[<0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 7>, <7, 8, 9>]
