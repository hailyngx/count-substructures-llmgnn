Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 8, 6>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 6, 1>
<3, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 8, 9>
<4, 8, 0>
<4, 8, 3>
<4, 5, 7>
<7, 5, 9>
<7, 5, 6>
<7, 6, 9>
<9, 1, 8>
<9, 1, 6> 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
