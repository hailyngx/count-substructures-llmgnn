Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

[<0, 5, 9> <2, 7, 8> <3, 4, 8> <3, 4, 8> <3, 8, 5> <4, 3, 8> <4, 8, 5> <5, 0, 9> <5, 6, 8> <8, 2, 3> <8, 2, 4> <8, 3, 4> <8, 3, 5> <8, 4, 5> <8, 5, 9>] 

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in total. 
Final Answer: [15]
