Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<1, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 6>
<2, 4, 8>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in total.
