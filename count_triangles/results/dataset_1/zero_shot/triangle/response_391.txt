Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be counted by looking for cycles of length 3. Let's list down the triangles:

<0, 3, 5>  
<1, 2, 8>  
<1, 2, 3>  
<1, 2, 5>  
<2, 3, 4>  
<2, 3, 8>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
