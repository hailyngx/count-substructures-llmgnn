Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 4>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in this graph.
