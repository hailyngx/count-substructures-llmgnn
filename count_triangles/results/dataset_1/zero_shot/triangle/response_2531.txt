Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows: 

<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
