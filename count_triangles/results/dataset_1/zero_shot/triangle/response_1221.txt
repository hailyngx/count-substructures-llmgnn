Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, 3, 7>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 9, 1>
<0, 9, 2>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 9, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
