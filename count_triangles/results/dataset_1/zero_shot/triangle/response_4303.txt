Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].  

The unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 9, 3>.
