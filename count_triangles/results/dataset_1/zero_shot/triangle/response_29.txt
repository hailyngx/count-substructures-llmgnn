Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 8, 9>  

There are a total of 7 triangles in the graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [7].
