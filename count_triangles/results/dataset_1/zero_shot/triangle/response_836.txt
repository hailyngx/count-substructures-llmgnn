Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 9>

Thus, there are [5] triangles in total.
