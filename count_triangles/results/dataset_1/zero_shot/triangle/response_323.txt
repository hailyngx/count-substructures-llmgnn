Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of triangles:

<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 1, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 0, 9>
<3, 2, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
