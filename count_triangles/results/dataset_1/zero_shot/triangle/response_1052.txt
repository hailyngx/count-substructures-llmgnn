Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 2, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 32 triangles in total in this graph. 
[<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 2, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>]
