Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [5] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 0>, <2, 4, 7>, <8, 9, 1>.
