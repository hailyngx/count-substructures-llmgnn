Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible triangles formed by the edges.

After analyzing the graph, the triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 0, 2>
<1, 0, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 0, 1>
<2, 0, 4>
<2, 0, 9>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 1, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 2, 9>
<4, 3, 9>
<4, 9, 8>
<8, 3, 9>
<8, 6, 9>
<9, 0, 4>
<9, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [22].
