Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<2, 7, 6>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 6>
<7, 8, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 1, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
