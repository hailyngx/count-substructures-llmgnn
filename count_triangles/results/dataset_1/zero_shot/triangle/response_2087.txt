Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [10] triangles in the given graph:
<1, 9, 2>, <3, 0, 4>, <3, 1, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 1, 5>, <4, 3, 0>, <5, 1, 9>, <6, 7, 9>
