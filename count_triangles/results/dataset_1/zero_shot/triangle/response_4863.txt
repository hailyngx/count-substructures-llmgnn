Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are:
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 5>
<6, 9, 7>
Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
