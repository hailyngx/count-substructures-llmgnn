Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are:

<2, 6, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 5>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 8, 6>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
