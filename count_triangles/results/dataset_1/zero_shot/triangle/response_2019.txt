Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangle in a graph is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's count the number of triangles in this graph:
Looking at the edges given, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
