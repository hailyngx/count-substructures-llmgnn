Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <6, 8, 9>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
