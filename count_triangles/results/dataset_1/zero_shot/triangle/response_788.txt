Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting all possible triangles formed by the edges in the graph. Let's calculate it:

First, let's identify all unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the number of unique triangles:
