Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are: <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, and <5, 8, 9>.

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
