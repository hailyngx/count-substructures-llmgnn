Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

[<1, 6, 4>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 8, 5>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 9>, <6, 4, 7>]
