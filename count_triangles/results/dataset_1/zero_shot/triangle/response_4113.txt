Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [12] triangles in the given graph.  

The unique triangles are <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 0>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 9, 0>.
