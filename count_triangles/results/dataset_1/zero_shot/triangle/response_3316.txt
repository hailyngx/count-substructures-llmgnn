Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique paths of length 2 between nodes. Let's calculate the number of triangles:

From the given edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 0, 5>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
