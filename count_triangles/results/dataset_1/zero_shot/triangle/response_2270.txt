Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 9>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the graph.
