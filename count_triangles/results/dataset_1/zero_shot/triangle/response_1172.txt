Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The graph provided can be visualized as follows:

    0 --- 9
    |     |
    1 --- 2 --- 8
    |   / | \   |
    |  4--5--7  |
    | /     \  /
    6 ------- 3

After examining the graph, I have identified the following triangles:
<1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in this graph.
