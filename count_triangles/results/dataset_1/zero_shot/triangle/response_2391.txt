Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be listed as follows:
<1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>

There are a total of 11 unique triangles present in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
