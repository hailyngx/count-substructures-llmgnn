Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph can be identified by finding cycles of length 3. 

Let's list the triangles present in this graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <1, 2, 3>
3. <1, 4, 6>
4. <2, 3, 4>
5. <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [5].
