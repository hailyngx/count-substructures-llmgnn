Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The graph has the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 8>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
