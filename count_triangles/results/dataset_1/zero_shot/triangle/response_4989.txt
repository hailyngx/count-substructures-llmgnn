Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find the number of triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges to form a closed loop.

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, calculating the triangles in the graph:
Here are the unique triangles found:

<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] triangles.
