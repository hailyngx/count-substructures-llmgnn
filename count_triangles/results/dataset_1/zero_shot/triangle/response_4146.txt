Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles each node is involved in.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
