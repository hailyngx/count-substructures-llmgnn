Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
