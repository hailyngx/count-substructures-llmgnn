Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
The total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
