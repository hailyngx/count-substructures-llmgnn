Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <3, 5, 7>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
