Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. Here is the list of unique triangles found: 

<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 7, 3>
<2, 1, 3>
<3, 1, 7>
<3, 7, 1>
<8, 4, 8>
<8, 8, 5>
<8, 5, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [9].
