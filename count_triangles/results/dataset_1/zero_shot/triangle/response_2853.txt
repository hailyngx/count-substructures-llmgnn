Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of triangles formed by every set of three connected nodes.

After carefully reviewing the provided edges and nodes, we can see that there are a total of 3 triangles in the graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [3] and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, and <2, 7, 9>.
