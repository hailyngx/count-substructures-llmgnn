Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. Here they are:
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
