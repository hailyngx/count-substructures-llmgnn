Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 4>

There are 10 triangles in total. [10]
