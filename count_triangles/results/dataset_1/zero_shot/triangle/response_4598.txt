Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 2>
<1, 6, 9>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
