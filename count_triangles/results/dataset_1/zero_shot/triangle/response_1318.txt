Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: 12

Therefore, the answer is [12].
