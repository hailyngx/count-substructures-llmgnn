Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
        1 -- 7
       /|    | \
      9 |    | 5
     /  |    |  |
    2   8 -- 0  |
     \  |\   |  |
      6 | 4 |  |
       \ |  \| /
         3 -- 5
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected with each node connected to the other two. Let's list the unique triangles found:
1. <1, 8, 2>
2. <1, 9, 2>
3. <2, 8, 1>
4. <5, 9, 1>
5. <5, 7, 1>
6. <6, 4, 2>
7. <7, 5, 1>
8. <7, 5, 0>
9. <8, 0, 1>
10. <9, 5, 1>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. [10]
