Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be determined by looking for nodes that form a cycle of length 3. Let's find the triangles present in this graph:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 3, 6>
3. Triangle 3: <1, 3, 5>
4. Triangle 4: <2, 3, 5>
5. Triangle 5: <2, 3, 7>
6. Triangle 6: <2, 4, 5>
7. Triangle 7: <3, 5, 6>
8. Triangle 8: <3, 5, 8>
9. Triangle 9: <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 9.  
So, the final answer is [9].
