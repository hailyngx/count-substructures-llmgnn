Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 --- 7
|     |
|     |
7 --- 3
|  \  |
|   \ |
9 --- 2
  \   |
   \  |
    9
```

To find the number of triangles in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 7 is connected to nodes 3. Hence triangle <0, 7, 3> is formed.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 7 is connected to nodes 9. Hence triangle <0, 7, 9> is formed.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9 is connected to nodes 2. Hence triangle <0, 9, 2> is formed.
- Similarly, the other triangles formed are <3, 7, 9>, <2, 9, 7>, <2, 9, 7>.
- The total number of triangles in the graph is 5.

Therefore, the output is [5].
