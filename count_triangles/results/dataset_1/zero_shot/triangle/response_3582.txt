Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<6, 4, 1>
<6, 4, 9>
<9, 7, 3>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
