Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
