Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 4, 9> 
<1, 4, 9> 
<0, 1, 9> 
<1, 6, 9> 
<0, 1, 8> 
<4, 6, 9> 
<0, 8, 6> 
<1, 7, 9> 

There are 8 unique triangles in total, thus the number of triangles in the graph is [8].
