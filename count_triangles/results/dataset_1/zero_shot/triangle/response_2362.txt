Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by summing up the triangles formed around each node. We can see from the given edges that the possible triangles are:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <1, 3, 4>
5. <2, 3, 5>
6. <3, 4, 9>
7. <3, 5, 6>
8. <4, 5, 9>
9. <5, 7, 9>

Thus, there are a total of 9 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
