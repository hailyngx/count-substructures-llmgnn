Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
