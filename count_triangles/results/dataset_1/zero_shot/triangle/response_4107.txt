Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the graph.
