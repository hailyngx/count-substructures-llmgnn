Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, and <1, 6, 9>.
