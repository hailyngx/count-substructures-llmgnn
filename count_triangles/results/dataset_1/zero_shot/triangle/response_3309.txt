Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <1, 6, 4>
4. Triangle <3, 5, 2>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
