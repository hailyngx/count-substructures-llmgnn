Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<3, 8, 5>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
