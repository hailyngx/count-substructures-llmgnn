Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 2>
<2, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the graph.
