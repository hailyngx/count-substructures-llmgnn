Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
I will find the number of triangles formed in this graph.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 6, 4>
<6, 4, 0>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 3>
<7, 9, 1>
<7, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
