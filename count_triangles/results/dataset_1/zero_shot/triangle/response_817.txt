Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in this graph. The triangles are:

<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>

So, the final answer is [4].
