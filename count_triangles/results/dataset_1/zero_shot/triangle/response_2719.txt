Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
