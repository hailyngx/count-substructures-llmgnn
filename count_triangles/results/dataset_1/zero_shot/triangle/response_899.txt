Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [28] edges in the given graph.

When counting the number of triangles, we need to look for three vertices that are all connected to each other forming a closed triangle. Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:

<[0, 3, 4]>
<[0, 4, 5]>
<[0, 5, 6]>

There are [3] triangles in total.
