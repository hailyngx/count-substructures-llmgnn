Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
