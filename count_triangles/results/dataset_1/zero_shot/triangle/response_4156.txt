Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
      1     3
       \   /
        \ /
  5 ---- 0 ----- 2 ---- 4
        / \     /
       /   \   /
      7     6 8
             |
             |
             9
```

The triangles in this graph can be identified as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <6, 8, 7>

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. So, the final answer is [7].
