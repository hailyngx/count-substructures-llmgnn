Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here they are: 
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 9, 6>
<5, 3, 8>
<1, 9, 6>
There are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
