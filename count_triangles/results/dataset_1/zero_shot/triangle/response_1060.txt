Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 19 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

[<0, 1, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 3>, <2, 1, 5>, <6, 3, 7>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 5, 2>, <6, 8, 7>, <6, 9, 6>, <7, 3, 4>, <7, 4, 1>, <7, 8, 6>, <7, 1, 0>, <8, 6, 0>, <8, 7, 1>, <9, 6, 0>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [19].
