Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph.  
The triangles are:  
<1, 5, 9>  
<1, 7, 9>  
<2, 5, 6>  
<3, 4, 6>  
<3, 6, 5>  
<4, 5, 1>  
<4, 7, 1>  
<5, 6, 2>  
  
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
