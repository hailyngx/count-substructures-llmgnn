Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 8>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
