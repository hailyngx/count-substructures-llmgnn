Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 1, 5>
<2, 1, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<8, 6, 7>
<0, 5, 1>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
