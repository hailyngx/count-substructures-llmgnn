Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
1. <1, 4, 5>
2. <2, 3, 5>
3. <2, 7, 8>
4. <2, 7, 8>
5. <5, 6, 7>
6. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
