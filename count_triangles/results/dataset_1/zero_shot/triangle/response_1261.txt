Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 0>
<4, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 3>
<6, 8, 1>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
