Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:

<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in total.
