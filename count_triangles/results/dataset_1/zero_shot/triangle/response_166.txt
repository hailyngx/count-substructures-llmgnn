Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 20 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 9, 7>
<7, 9, 1>
<8, 9, 1>
<8, 9, 5>
<9, 7, 1>

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
