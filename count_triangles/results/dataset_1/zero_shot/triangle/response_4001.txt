Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 1, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 0, 6>
<6, 7, 3>
<6, 0, 5>

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
