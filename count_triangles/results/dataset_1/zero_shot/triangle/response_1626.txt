Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 9, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<4, 6, 8>

So, there are [6] triangles in total.
