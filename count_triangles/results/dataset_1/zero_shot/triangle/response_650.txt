Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 9, 8>, <1, 0, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 0>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 7, 2>, <3, 2, 4>
Counting all unique triangles, we have a total of [15] triangles in the graph.
