Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by looking at each node and counting the number of triangles it participates in. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in the graph.

Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:
- Node 0 participates in the triangles: <0, 2, 6> and <0, 7, 4>
- Node 1 participates in the triangle: <1, 5, 8>
- Node 2 participates in the triangles: <2, 0, 6> and <2, 5, 4>
- Node 3: No triangles
- Node 4: No triangles
- Node 5 participates in the triangle: <5, 1, 8>
- Node 6: No triangles
- Node 7: No triangles
- Node 8: No triangles
- Node 9: No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 7, 4>, and <1, 5, 8>.
