Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique triangles formed by the nodes. 

The graph formed by the given edges is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 2.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to node 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7.

Now, let's find the unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 9, 7>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph: [<0, 1, 2>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 9, 7>].
