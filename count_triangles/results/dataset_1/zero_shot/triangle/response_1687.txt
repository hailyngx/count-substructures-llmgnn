Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph, and they are represented as follows:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
