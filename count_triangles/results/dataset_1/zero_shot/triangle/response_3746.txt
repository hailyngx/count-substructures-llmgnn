Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 unique triangles in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
