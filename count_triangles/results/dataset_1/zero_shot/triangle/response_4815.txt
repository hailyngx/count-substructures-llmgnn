Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of paths of length 2 between all possible node pairs. Since a triangle consists of three nodes, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are connected.

The unique triangles found in the given graph are:
<0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
