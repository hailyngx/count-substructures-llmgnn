Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The unique triangles in this graph are: <2, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <7, 9, 3>.
  
Therefore, there are 7 triangles in total.  
So, the answer is [7].
