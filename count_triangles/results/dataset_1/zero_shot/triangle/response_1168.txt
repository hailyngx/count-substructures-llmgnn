Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph: [4]

The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 4>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <5, 6, 9>.
