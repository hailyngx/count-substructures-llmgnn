Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

<2, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

There are 7 unique triangles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
