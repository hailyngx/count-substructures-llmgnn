Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
[<0, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 9>]
