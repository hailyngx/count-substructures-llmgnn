Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by counting the number of unique triangles formed by every set of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 9, 2>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
