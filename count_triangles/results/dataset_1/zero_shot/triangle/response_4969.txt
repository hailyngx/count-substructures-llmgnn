Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph.  

The unique triangles are <1, 2, 4>, <1, 9, 7>, <1, 9, 3>, <1, 9, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 9>.
