Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<8, 9, 7>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the graph. So, the answer is [9].
