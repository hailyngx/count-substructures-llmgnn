Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique triangles that can be formed:
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 9, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<5, 4, 7>
<5, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
