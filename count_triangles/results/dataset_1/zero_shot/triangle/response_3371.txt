Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
    1 -- 0 -- 3 -- 5
    |         |    |
    4 -- 8    9    6 -- 2
    |    |
    7    |
         |
         ---------
```

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can identify the unique triangles formed by three nodes that are all connected by edges.

Here are the triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 2>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 3, 9>, <6, 2, 0>, <8, 7, 4>.
Some triangles may have been repeated in the list above, and hence the final answer is counted within brackets [].
