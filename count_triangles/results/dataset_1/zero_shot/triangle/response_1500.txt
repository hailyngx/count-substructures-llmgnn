Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 6, 9>

There are a total of 2 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [2].
