Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 8, 5>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in total. [11]
