Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
