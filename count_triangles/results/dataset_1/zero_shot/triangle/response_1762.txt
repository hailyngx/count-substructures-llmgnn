Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
