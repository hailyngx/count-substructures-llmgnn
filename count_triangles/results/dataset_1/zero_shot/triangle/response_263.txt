Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph can be found by counting the unique triangles formed by 3 nodes. 

After examining the provided edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
