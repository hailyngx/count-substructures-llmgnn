Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 1, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 6, 9>
<8, 9, 0>
<8, 9, 1>
<8, 9, 2>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
