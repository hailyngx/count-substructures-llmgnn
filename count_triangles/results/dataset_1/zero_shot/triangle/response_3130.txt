Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are:
- <0, 7, 9>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <1, 6, 3>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <6, 3, 7>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
