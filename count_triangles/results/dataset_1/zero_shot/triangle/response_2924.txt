Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 1>
<5, 9, 6>
<6, 7, 9>
<9, 8, 6>
<9, 8, 0>
<9, 0, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
