Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 6>, <2, 0, 1>, <4, 5, 9>, and <4, 6, 8>.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
