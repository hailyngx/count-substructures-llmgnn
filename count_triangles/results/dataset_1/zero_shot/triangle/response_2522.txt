Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<0, 3, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 7, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
