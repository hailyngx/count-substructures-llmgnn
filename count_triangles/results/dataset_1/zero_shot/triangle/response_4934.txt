Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 3>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<7, 1, 6>
<7, 1, 8>
<7, 3, 4>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the graph. So, the final answer is [9].
