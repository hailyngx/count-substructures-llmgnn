Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The unique triangles found in the given graph are:
<2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 3>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 2, 5>, <5, 2, 6>, <5, 2, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <9, 1, 3>, <9, 1, 4>, <9, 3, 7>, <9, 3, 5>, <9, 5, 6>, <9, 6, 7>

Count of triangles: [17]
