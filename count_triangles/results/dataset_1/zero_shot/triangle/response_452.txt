Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 3>, <3, 5, 8>, and <3, 7, 9>.
