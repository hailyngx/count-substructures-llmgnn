Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles:

<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 3>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 9, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
