Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, and <7, 9, 5>. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
