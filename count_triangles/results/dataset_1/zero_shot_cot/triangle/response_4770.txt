Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Triangles can be found by looking for nodes that are connected to each other in groups of three.
Let's list the triangles first:
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 8>

Now, we need to count the total number of triangles formed in this graph. The total number of triangles is 4, as shown in the list above.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
