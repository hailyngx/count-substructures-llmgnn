Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze each possible triangle formed by 3 nodes. 

The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of **9 triangles** in this graph.
