Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Let's examine each node and its connections to identify any triangles:
   Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 8
   Node 1: Connected to node 5
   Node 2: Connected to node 9
   Node 3: Connected to nodes 4 and 7
   Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 9
   Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7
   Node 6: Connected to nodes 0 and 9
   Node 7: Connected to nodes 3 and 5
   Node 8: Connected to node 0
   Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6

2. Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
   - <0, 4, 5>
   - <0, 4, 9>
   - <0, 5, 7>
   - <4, 5, 7>
   - <4, 5, 9>

3. Finally, count the total number of triangles and list them:
   Total number of triangles: [5]
   Unique triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 9>
