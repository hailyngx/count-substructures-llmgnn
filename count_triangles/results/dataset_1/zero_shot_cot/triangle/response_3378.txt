Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1.  Count the triangles by checking each unique combination of three nodes:

    - Triangle 1: (0, 3, 5)
    - Triangle 2: (0, 1, 7)
    - Triangle 3: (1, 2, 7)
    - Triangle 4: (3, 6, 9)

2.  Output: There are [4] triangles in the graph.

I hope this clarifies the process.
