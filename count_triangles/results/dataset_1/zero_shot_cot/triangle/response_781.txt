Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [8]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 9>.
