Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges, let's identify the triangles present.

Starting with each edge, we look for a node that connects the endpoints of the edge (e.g., if we have an edge between nodes 0 and 3, then we look for other nodes that are connected to both 0 and 3 to form a triangle).

Here are the triangles identified:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <0, 6, 9>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <4, 5, 8>
7. <6, 1, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
