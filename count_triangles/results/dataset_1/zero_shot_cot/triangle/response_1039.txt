Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's find the number of triangles in the graph.

Step 1: Identify triangles in the graph
- A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in a closed loop.
- To find triangles, we need to look for nodes that are connected to each other in such a way that they form a closed loop with three edges.

Step 2: Count the number of triangles
- Let's identify the triangles by examining the given edges:
  - Triangle 1: (0, 3, 7)
  - Triangle 2: (0, 4, 7)
  - Triangle 3: (3, 6, 4)

Step 3: Calculate the total number of triangles
- The total number of triangles in the given graph is 3.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, and <3, 6, 4>.
