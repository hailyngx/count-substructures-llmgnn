Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. Let's do this step by step:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

```plaintext
Edges:
(0, 7) (0, 9)
(1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8)
(2, 7)
(3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9)
(4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8)
(5, 6)
(6, 5)
(7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8)
(8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7)
(9, 0) (9, 3)
```

Now let's find the triangles:
1. Triangle <1, 3, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 8, 7>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
8. Triangle <7, 8, 1>
9. Triangle <0, 9, 3>
10. Triangle <0, 7, 2>

Total number of triangles: [10]
