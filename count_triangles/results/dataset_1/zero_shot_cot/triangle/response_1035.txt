Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the triangles in this graph. A triangle is formed when there are three nodes connected by three edges to form a closed loop. We will calculate this step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
   - Triangle <0, 3, 7>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
   - No new triangles.

3. Node 2 is connected to node 4.
   - No new triangles.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
   - No new triangles.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
   - Triangle <2, 4, 8>

6. Node 5 is connected to node 9.
   - No new triangles.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9.
   - Triangle <1, 6, 7>
   - Triangle <6, 8, 9>

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6.
   - No new triangles.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
   - No new triangles.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 8.
   - Triangle <4, 6, 9>
   - No new triangles.

Now, we have found the triangles in the graph:
- <0, 3, 7>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <6, 8, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
