Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to check every set of three nodes and see if they form a triangle. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 3>
3. <1, 2, 6>
4. <1, 4, 9>
5. <1, 6, 8>
6. <3, 5, 9>
7. <6, 8, 9>

There are a total of [7] triangles in this graph.
