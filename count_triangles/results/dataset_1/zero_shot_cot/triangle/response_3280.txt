Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 1)
- Triangle 2: (1, 4, 6)
- Triangle 3: (1, 5, 9)
- Triangle 4: (2, 0, 6)
- Triangle 5: (3, 5, 6)

Thus, there are [5] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 1>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 0, 6>, and <3, 5, 6>.
