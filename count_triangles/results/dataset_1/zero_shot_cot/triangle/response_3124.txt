Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 4, 8>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
