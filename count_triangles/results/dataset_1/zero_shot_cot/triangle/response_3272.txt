Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected by edges (form a triangle).

Analyzing the provided edges, we can determine the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <0, 6, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 7, 1>
4. Triangle <0, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <1, 7, 0>
6. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 6, 4>
8. Triangle <3, 6, 8>
9. Triangle <3, 8, 4>
10. Triangle <4, 6, 8>
11. Triangle <6, 0, 7>
12. Triangle <6, 2, 9>
13. Triangle <6, 3, 4>
14. Triangle <6, 4, 8>
15. Triangle <7, 0, 1>
16. Triangle <8, 3, 4>
17. Triangle <8, 3, 6>
18. Triangle <8, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [18].
