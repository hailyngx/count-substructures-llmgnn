Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two steps to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

Step 1: Identify unique triangles in the graph:
- From the edges given, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <6, 3, 5>, <6, 4, 5>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles:
- Since we have identified 10 unique triangles, the total number of triangles is [10].
