Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the total number of triangles in the graph, we can look at each possible triangle formed by the edges given in the graph. 

Let's start by listing out the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<7, 4, 9>
<8, 5, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph [16].
