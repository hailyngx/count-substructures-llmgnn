Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a matrix representation of the graph to help visualize the connections between nodes:

```
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0   0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
1   1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
2   1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
3   0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
4   0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
5   0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
6   0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
7   1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
8   0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
9   0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
```

Next, let's count the number of triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. 

To find triangles, we observe that a triangle is formed when there is a connection between each of the three nodes. For example, if nodes A, B, and C form a triangle, then there should be edges (A, B), (B, C), and (C, A) present in the graph.

Considering the adjacency matrix above, we can identify the presence of triangles by looking for connected triples of nodes. Let's list down the unique triangles:

<0, 1, 2>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 6, 3>
<2, 4, 1>
<2, 7, 0>
<2, 8, 3>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 8, 5>
<3, 9, 1>
<4, 5, 8>
<7, 0, 2>
<7, 9, 1>
<8, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
