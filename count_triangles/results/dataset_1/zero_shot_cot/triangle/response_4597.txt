Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
By examining the given graph, let's find all the triangles present in it:
- Nodes connected in a triangle shape are considered as a triangle.
- From the given edges, we can see the following triangles:
  - Triangles involving node 0: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 7>
  - Triangles involving node 1: <1, 4, 8>
  - Triangles involving node 2: <0, 2, 7>
  - Triangles involving node 3: <0, 3, 9>
  - Triangles involving node 4: <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 7>
  - Triangles involving node 6: <4, 6, 9>
  - Triangles involving node 7: <2, 7, 4>, <4, 7, 8>
  - Triangles involving node 8: <1, 8, 4>, <1, 8, 7>
- So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
