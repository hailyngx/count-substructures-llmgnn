Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes (0, 4, 6)
- Triangle 2: Nodes (1, 2, 8)
- Triangle 3: Nodes (1, 2, 9)
- Triangle 4: Nodes (2, 3, 6)
- Triangle 5: Nodes (2, 4, 6)
- Triangle 6: Nodes (2, 8, 1)
- Triangle 7: Nodes (3, 6, 9)

2. Count the total number of triangles: [7]

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 7.
