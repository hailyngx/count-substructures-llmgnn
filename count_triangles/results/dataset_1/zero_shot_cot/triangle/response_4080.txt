Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each possible triangle formed by three nodes and check if there is an edge between each pair of nodes.

Given graph edges:
- (0, 7)
- (0, 9)
- (1, 4)
- (1, 5)
- (1, 6)
- (4, 1)
- (4, 5)
- (4, 8)
- (5, 1)
- (5, 4)
- (5, 7)
- (5, 9)
- (6, 1)
- (6, 7)
- (7, 0)
- (7, 5)
- (7, 6)
- (8, 4)
- (9, 0)
- (9, 5)

We find the following unique triangles:
1. <1, 4, 5>
2. <1, 5, 6>
3. <1, 5, 7>
4. <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
