Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Observing the given graph, we can find the triangles by looking at nodes that have edges between each other. Let's see which triangles are present in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 3>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <2, 4, 9>
5. <2, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
