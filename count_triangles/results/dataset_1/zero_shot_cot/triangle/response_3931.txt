Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles by checking each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

List of triangles:
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
