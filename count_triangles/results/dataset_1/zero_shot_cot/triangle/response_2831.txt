Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's determine the triangles step-by-step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9. This forms a triangle: <0, 3, 9>.

2. Node 1 is connected to node 6, but no additional triangle is formed.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 9. This forms two triangles: <2, 3, 4> and <2, 4, 5>.

4. Node 3 is already part of the triangles mentioned above.

5. Node 4 is part of the triangle <2, 3, 4> and forms another triangle with nodes 3 and 8: <3, 4, 8>.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9. This forms a triangle: <5, 8, 9>.

7. Node 6 is connected to node 1 and 3. No additional triangles are formed.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 8, but no triangle is formed.

9. Node 8 is part of the triangles mentioned above.

10. Node 9 is already part of the triangles mentioned above.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in total in the given graph. The triangles are: <0, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, and <5, 8, 9>.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [5].
