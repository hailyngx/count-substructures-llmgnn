Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph. Here they are listed uniquely:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
