Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze the connections between the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Analyzing the given edges:

- Nodes 0, 1, and 4 form a triangle: <0, 1, 4>
- Nodes 1, 4, and 6 form a triangle: <1, 4, 6>
- Nodes 1, 5, and 2 form a triangle: <1, 5, 2>
- Nodes 3, 7, and 1 form a triangle: <3, 7, 1>
- Nodes 4, 6, and 9 form a triangle: <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
