Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. First, let's list the triangles based on the given edges:
   - Triangle 1: <1, 5, 7>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 5, 9>
   - Triangle 3: <3, 0, 5>
   - Triangle 4: <3, 1, 9>
   - Triangle 5: <3, 5, 7>
   - Triangle 6: <5, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 7: <8, 5, 7>
   - Triangle 8: <9, 6, 7>

2. Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles: [8]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
