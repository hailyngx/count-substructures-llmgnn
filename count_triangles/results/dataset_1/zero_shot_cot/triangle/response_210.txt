Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph, which are formed by three nodes connected by edges. We will list the triangles below:

Triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 5>
<2, 8, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Next, let's count the total number of triangles found in the graph, including both unique and repeated triangles.

Total number of triangles: [8]
