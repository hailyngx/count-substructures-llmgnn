Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the given edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle 3: <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle 4: <4, 8, 6>
There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
