Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles by checking for nodes that are connected to each other through all three sides.

Looking at the edges provided, we can determine the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <1, 4, 8>
5. <2, 4, 6>
6. <2, 6, 7>
7. <3, 4, 5>
8. <4, 6, 9>
9. <4, 7, 5>
10. <6, 5, 7>
11. <8, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
