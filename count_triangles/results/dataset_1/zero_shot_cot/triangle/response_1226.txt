Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we can look for all possible triangles by checking for nodes that are connected in a triangle pattern. 

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Check for triangles involving Node 0:
   - (0, 2, 4)
   - (0, 4, 1)
   - (0, 2, 7)
   - (0, 7, 3)
   - (0, 3, 8)
   - (0, 8, 9)
   Total: 6 triangles

2. Check for triangles involving Node 1:
   - (1, 2, 5)
   - (1, 5, 4)
   Total: 2 triangles

3. Check for triangles involving Node 2:
   - (2, 5, 4)
   - (2, 0, 7)
   Total: 2 triangles

4. Check for triangles involving Node 3:
   - (3, 7, 8)
   Total: 1 triangle

5. Check for triangles involving Node 4:
   - (4, 5, 1)
   - (4, 5, 9)
   - (4, 8, 7)
   Total: 3 triangles

6. Check for triangles involving Node 5:
   - (5, 9, 0)
   Total: 1 triangle

7. Check for triangles involving Node 7:
   - (7, 8, 0)
   Total: 1 triangle

8. Check for triangles involving Node 8:
   No new triangles

9. Check for triangles involving Node 9:
   No new triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 16]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 4>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 0, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 7>, and <5, 9, 0>.
