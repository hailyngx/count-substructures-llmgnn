Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles found:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 7, 4>
3. <1, 9, 6>
4. <3, 4, 8>
5. <3, 4, 7>
6. <3, 4, 0>
7. <3, 4, 2>
