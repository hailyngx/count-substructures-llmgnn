Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the steps to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Identify Triangles**: To find triangles, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's find all possible triangles in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 2, 6)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 2, 4)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 3, 6)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 4, 7)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 4, 6)
   - Triangle 6: (2, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 7: (4, 6, 7)

2. **Count the Total Number of Triangles**: Count the total number of unique triangles found above. In this case, the total number of triangles is `[7]`. 

So, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
