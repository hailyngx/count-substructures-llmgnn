Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
I will proceed step-by-step to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Nodes with their respective neighbors:
   - Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 9
   - Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
   - Node 2: 0, 1, 4
   - Node 3: 1, 5
   - Node 4: 1, 2, 5
   - Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 8
   - Node 6: 8
   - Node 8: 1, 5, 6, 9
   - Node 9: 0, 1, 8

2. Triangles can be formed when three nodes are mutually connected. Checking for each possible triangle:
   - Triangle <0, 1, 2>
   - Triangle <0, 1, 5>
   - Triangle <0, 1, 9>
   - Triangle <0, 2, 4>
   - Triangle <0, 5, 8>
   - Triangle <1, 2, 4>
   - Triangle <1, 3, 5>
   - Triangle <1, 4, 5>
   - Triangle <1, 8, 9>
   - Triangle <5, 8, 9>

3. Counting the total number of triangles found:
   - Total number of triangles = 10

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
