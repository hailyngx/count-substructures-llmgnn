Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
We can calculate the number of triangles in this graph by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5. This forms a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 7. This forms four triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, and <1, 2, 7>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5. This forms one additional triangle: <0, 2, 4>.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8. This forms a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 9. This forms one additional triangle: <0, 5, 6>.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 5. This does not form any new triangles.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. This does not form any new triangles.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 7. This does not form any new triangles.
9. Node 9 is connected to node 5. This does not form any new triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
