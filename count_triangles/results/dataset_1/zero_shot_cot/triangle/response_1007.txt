Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the triangles in this graph.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 6, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 1>
5. Triangle <1, 6, 4>
6. Triangle <5, 0, 6>
7. Triangle <5, 0, 7>
8. Triangle <6, 4, 1>
9. Triangle <6, 7, 0>

Total number of triangles: [9]
