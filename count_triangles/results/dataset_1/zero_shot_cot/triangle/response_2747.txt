Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all the triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.
2. Check each combination of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Let's start by listing all the triangles found in the graph:

<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Counting the unique triangles listed above, we find that there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
