Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique sets of three nodes that are all interconnected (form triangles). Let's go step-by-step:

1. **List all triangles**:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 3, 5>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 5, 1>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <3, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 5: <6, 7, 8>
   - Triangle 6: <7, 8, 9>
   
2. **Count the total number of triangles**:
   - Total number of triangles: [6]
