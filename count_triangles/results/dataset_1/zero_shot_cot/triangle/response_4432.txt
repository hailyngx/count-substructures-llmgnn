Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the connected nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Triangle Combinations:
- (0, 1, 5)
- (0, 3, 9)
- (0, 4, 7)
- (0, 6, 9)
- (1, 5, 8)
- (2, 7, 4)
- (3, 9, 6)
- (8, 1, 5)

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 4>, <3, 9, 6>, <8, 1, 5>
