Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges. 

Let's list the unique triangles:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <1, 3, 5>
4. <2, 0, 8>
5. <3, 5, 1>
6. <3, 5, 6>
7. <3, 6, 9>
8. <6, 9, 3>

Counting the total number of triangles: [8]
