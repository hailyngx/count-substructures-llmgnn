Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the triangles in the graph.
    - Triangle 1: Nodes <0, 6, 9>
    - Triangle 2: Nodes <1, 3, 7>
    - Triangle 3: Nodes <1, 4, 2>
    - Triangle 4: Nodes <3, 9, 8>
    - Triangle 5: Nodes <6, 5, 0>
    - Triangle 6: Nodes <6, 7, 1>
    - Triangle 7: Nodes <6, 9, 8>
    - Triangle 8: Nodes <7, 8, 3>
    
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
