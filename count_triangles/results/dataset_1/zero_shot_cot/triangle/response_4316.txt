Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

Since counting triangles can be tedious, let's break it down step-by-step to make it easier.

Step 1: Find all triangles formed by each node.
- Triangle <0, 2, 7>
- Triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle <4, 5, 9>
- Triangle <6, 9, 4>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles obtained in step 1 and output the answer in brackets:
