This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique combinations of three nodes that form a triangle. Let's list down the triangles step by step:

1. Possible triangles involving Node 0:
   - <0, 1, 3>
   - <0, 1, 4>
   - <0, 5, 3>
   - <0, 5, 6>

2. Possible triangles involving Node 1:
   - <1, 0, 3>
   - <1, 0, 4>
   - <1, 4, 8>
   - <1, 3, 2>

3. Possible triangles involving Node 2:
   - <2, 3, 4>

4. Possible triangles involving Node 3:
   - <3, 1, 0>
   - <3, 1, 4>
   - <3, 1, 5>
   - <3, 2, 4>

5. Possible triangles involving Node 4:
   - <4, 1, 0>
   - <4, 1, 3>
   - <4, 1, 8>
   - <4, 2, 3>
   - <4, 2, 6>
   - <4, 6, 5>

6. Possible triangles involving Node 5:
   - <5, 0, 3>
   - <5, 0, 6>
   - <5, 8, 4>
   - <5, 3, 1>
   - <5, 3, 6>

7. Possible triangles involving Node 6:
   - <6, 0, 4>
   - <6, 0, 5>
   - <6, 9, 2>
   - <6, 4, 1>
   - <6, 5, 3>

8. Possible triangles involving Node 8:
   - <8, 1, 4>
   - <8, 1, 0>
   - <8, 5, 3>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [21].
