Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph step by step:
1. Identify all triangles:
   - (0, 1, 3)
   - (0, 1, 4)
   - (0, 3, 6)
   - (1, 4, 7)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
