Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a triangle.

The triangles can be formed by looking at different combinations of nodes that have edges connecting them. Let's go step-by-step to count the number of triangles:

1. Identify triangles:
   - Nodes with 3 edges connected will form a triangle.

2. Possible triangles:
   - <0, 1, 3>
   - <0, 1, 4>
   - <0, 1, 6>
   - <0, 3, 4>
   - <0, 3, 6>
   - <1, 3, 8>
   - <1, 4, 9>
   - <2, 5, 9>
   - <3, 4, 8>

3. Total number of triangles: [9] 

Thus, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
