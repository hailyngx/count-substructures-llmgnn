Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique combinations of nodes that form triangles. Triangles are formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <3, 4, 5>
3. <1, 5, 9>

Therefore, based on the triangles identified, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
