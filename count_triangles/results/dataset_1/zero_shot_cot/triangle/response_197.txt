Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's look for all possible triangles formed by the given edges.

The possible triangles are:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 6>
6. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
7. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
8. Triangle <5, 6, 9>
9. Triangle <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
