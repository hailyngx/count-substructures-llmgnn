Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Triangle 1: <0, 3, 6>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 3, 1>
3. Triangle 3: <3, 1, 8>
4. Triangle 4: <2, 4, 8>
5. Triangle 5: <2, 4, 5>
6. Triangle 6: <4, 2, 5>

There are 6 triangles in total. So, the output will be [6].
