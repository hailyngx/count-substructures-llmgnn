Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify the unique triangles by looking for nodes that share edges forming closed loops of length 3. 

1. Let's list the unique triangles:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <4, 7, 8>

2. Count the total number of triangles:
There are 9 unique triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
