Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the unique triangles found along with the total number of triangles:

Unique Triangles:
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 3>

Total number of triangles: [2]
