Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the triangles in the given graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 9, 1>
4. Triangle <0, 9, 4>
5. Triangle <2, 0, 4>
6. Triangle <4, 0, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 9, 7>
8. Triangle <9, 0, 1>
9. Triangle <9, 0, 4>
10. Triangle <9, 0, 7>
11. Triangle <9, 4, 7>
12. Triangle <9, 7, 5>
13. Triangle <9, 7, 1>

There are a total of 13 triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [13].
