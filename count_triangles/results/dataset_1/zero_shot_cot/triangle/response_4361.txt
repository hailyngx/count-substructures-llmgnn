Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's first identify all the triangles present:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
