Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

After examining the edges in the graph, we find the following unique triangles:
1. <0, 5, 1>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <1, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
