Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

From the given edges, we can see the following triangles:
1. (1, 3, 7)
2. (2, 5, 8)
3. (2, 8, 3)
4. (3, 6, 9)
5. (3, 8, 6)
6. (8, 6, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles in the graph is: [6]
