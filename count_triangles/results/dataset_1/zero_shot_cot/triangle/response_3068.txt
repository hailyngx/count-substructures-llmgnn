Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we'll look for each unique set of 3 nodes that are all interconnected. Let's go step by step:

1. Nodes connected to Node 0: {1, 5, 9}
2. Nodes connected to Node 1: {0, 2, 7, 9}
3. Nodes connected to Node 2: {1, 8, 9}
4. Nodes connected to Node 3: {7, 9}
5. Nodes connected to Node 4: {6}
6. Nodes connected to Node 5: {0, 7, 8}
7. Nodes connected to Node 6: {4, 9}
8. Nodes connected to Node 7: {1, 3, 5}
9. Nodes connected to Node 8: {2, 5}
10. Nodes connected to Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}

Now, let's find the unique triangles:

1. Triangles involving Node 0: <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangles involving Node 1: <1, 2, 9>
3. Triangles involving Node 2: (No new triangles)
4. Triangles involving Node 3: (No new triangles)
5. Triangles involving Node 4: (No triangles can be formed)
6. Triangles involving Node 5: (No new triangles)
7. Triangles involving Node 6: (No new triangles)
8. Triangles involving Node 7: (No new triangles)
9. Triangles involving Node 8: (No new triangles)
10. Triangles involving Node 9: <0, 1, 9>, <1, 2, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
