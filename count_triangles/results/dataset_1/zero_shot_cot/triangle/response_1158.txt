Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles formed by the connected nodes.
  - Triangles: <2, 3, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 9>

Step 2: Calculate the total number of triangles.
Total number of triangles: [4]
