Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the given graph:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
- Triangle 2: (2, 3, 5)
- Triangle 3: (2, 4, 5)
- Triangle 4: (2, 4, 8)
- Triangle 5: (3, 4, 5)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. 

There are [5] triangles in the given graph.
