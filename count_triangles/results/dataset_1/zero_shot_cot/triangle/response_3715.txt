Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine every set of three nodes and check if each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Let's denote the nodes from 0 to 9. Now, let's list the unique triangles found in this graph:  
<0, 2, 7>  
<0, 3, 7>  
<2, 6, 8>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
