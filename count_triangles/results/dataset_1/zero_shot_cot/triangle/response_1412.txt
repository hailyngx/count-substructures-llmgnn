Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes together.

Let's examine each possible triangle formed by the given edges:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
4. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 4>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
7. Triangle <3, 5, 6>
8. Triangle <3, 7, 9>

There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
