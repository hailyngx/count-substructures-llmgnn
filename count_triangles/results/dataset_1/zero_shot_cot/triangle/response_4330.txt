Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency matrix based on the given edges:

```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
0   0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  0  1
1   0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  1
2   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0
3   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
4   1  0  0  0  0  1  0  1  0  0
5   1  0  0  0  1  0  1  1  0  0
6   1  1  0  0  0  1  0  1  0  0
7   1  0  1  0  1  1  1  0  1  0
8   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0
9   1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
