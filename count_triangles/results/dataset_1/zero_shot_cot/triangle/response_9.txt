Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
5. Triangle <2, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
