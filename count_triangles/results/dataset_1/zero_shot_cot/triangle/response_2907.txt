Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
3. Triangle <1, 2, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
6. Triangle <5, 6, 0>
7. Triangle <5, 6, 2>
8. Triangle <5, 8, 1>
9. Triangle <5, 8, 3>

Thus, there are a total of [9] triangles in this graph.
