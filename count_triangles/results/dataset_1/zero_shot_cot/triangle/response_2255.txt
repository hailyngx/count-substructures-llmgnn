Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can check each possible combination of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
