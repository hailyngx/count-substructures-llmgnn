Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all triangles by checking each set of three nodes to see if they are connected to each other.  

The triangles found are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <0, 4, 8>
5. <0, 4, 9>
6. <1, 2, 4>
7. <1, 4, 8>
8. <2, 4, 7>
9. <3, 4, 9>
10. <3, 5, 8>
11. <4, 6, 8>
12. <4, 8, 9>
13. <5, 8, 9>
14. <6, 8, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.  
[Triangles: 14]
