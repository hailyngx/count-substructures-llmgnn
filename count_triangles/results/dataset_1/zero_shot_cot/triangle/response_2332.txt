Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we can calculate the number of triangles present by examining all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are connected by edges.

Let's start by listing the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <1, 2, 6>
6. <1, 4, 6>
7. <2, 4, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
