Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

First, let's list all the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <3, 5, 6>
3. <6, 7, 8>

Counting the total number of triangles, we get: [3].
