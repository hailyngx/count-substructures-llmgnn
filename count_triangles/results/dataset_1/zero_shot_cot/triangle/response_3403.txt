Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles present. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected with edges to form a closed loop. We'll go step-by-step in determining the number of triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 2>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 6>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <6, 3, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
