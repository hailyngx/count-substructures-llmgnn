Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Initially, we can count the triangles using the edges provided:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 5>

Now, we can check for any additional triangles created by the existing triangles:

- The triangle formed by nodes <0, 2, 4> can form another triangle if we find an edge between node 0 and node 4. Since there is an edge between node 0 and node 8, this completes the triangle <0, 4, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
