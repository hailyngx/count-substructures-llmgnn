Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangles involving node 0: None
2. Triangles involving node 1: None
3. Triangles involving node 2: <2, 1, 3>, <2, 6, 9>
4. Triangles involving node 3: <3, 0, 7>, <3, 1, 5>, <3, 2, 6>, <3, 6, 7>
5. Triangles involving node 5: None
6. Triangles involving node 6: <6, 2, 9>, <6, 7, 9>
7. Triangles involving node 7: None
8. Triangles involving node 8: None
9. Triangles involving node 9: None

Now, if we count the total number of triangles from the identified ones, we get the value [6].
