Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node  
- Node 0: degree = 5  
- Node 1: degree = 3  
- Node 2: degree = 3  
- Node 3: degree = 3  
- Node 4: degree = 4  
- Node 5: degree = 3  
- Node 6: degree = 5  
- Node 7: degree = 4  
- Node 8: degree = 4  

Step 2: Look for triangles  
- For a triangle, we need 3 connected nodes. Let's go through each node:
  - Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
    - (0, 1) and (1, 0) connects node 0 and node 1
    - (0, 4) and (4, 0) connects node 0 and node 4
    - No triangle found with node 0
  - Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 6, 7
    - No triangle found with node 1
  - Node 2: Neighbors are 4, 6, 8
    - No triangle found with node 2
  - Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 5, 7
    - No triangle found with node 3
  - Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 2, 6, 8
    - (0, 2) and (2, 0) connects node 0 and node 2
    - (0, 6) and (6, 0) connects node 0 and node 6
    - (2, 6) and (6, 2) connects node 2 and node 6
    - No triangle found with node 4
  - Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 3, 6
    - No triangle found with node 5
  - Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
    - (1, 2) and (2, 1) connects node 1 and node 2
    - (1, 7) and (7, 1) connects node 1 and node 7
    - (2, 7) and (7, 2) connects node 2 and node 7
    - No triangle found with node 6
  - Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 3, 6, 8
    - (1, 8) and (8, 1) connects node 1 and node 8
    - (3, 7) and (7, 3) connects node 3 and node 7
    - No triangle found with node 7
  - Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 7
    - No triangle found with node 8

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles  
- We found 3 triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 8>
