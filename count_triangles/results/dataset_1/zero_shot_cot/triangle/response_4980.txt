Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by three interconnected nodes in the graph.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
