Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each unique set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given edges, the possible triangles in this graph are:
1. <1, 6, 9>
2. <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
