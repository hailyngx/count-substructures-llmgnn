Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other (form a triangle). 

Let's list out the unique triangles in the graph:

1. <1, 3, 6>
2. <1, 3, 7>
3. <1, 6, 5>
4. <2, 4, 0>
5. <2, 4, 5>
6. <2, 6, 5>
7. <3, 6, 5>
8. <3, 6, 7>
9. <3, 7, 5>
10. <6, 7, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
