Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 5.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:

- Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 3, and 5 form a triangle. <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 2: Nodes 3, 5, and 8 form a triangle. <3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
