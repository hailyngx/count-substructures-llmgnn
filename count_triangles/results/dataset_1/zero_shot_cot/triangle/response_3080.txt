Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can first start by looking at each possible triangle formation. A triangle is formed when there are three nodes connected by edges to each other, creating a closed loop.

Let's list down the possible triangles:
1. (1, 2, 5)
2. (1, 5, 7)
3. (2, 4, 5)
4. (5, 7, 8)
5. (6, 9, 8)
6. (1, 2, 4)
7. (1, 2, 7)
8. (1, 5, 8)
9. (2, 5, 8)
10. (5, 7, 1)
11. (5, 7, 8)
12. (1, 7, 8)
13. (2, 5, 1)
14. (2, 5, 7)
15. (1, 5, 2)
16. (5, 2, 1)
17. (5, 8, 7)
18. (7, 1, 5)
19. (7, 5, 8)
20. (1, 8, 7)
21. (2, 1, 5)
22. (5, 1, 2)
23. (5, 8, 1)
24. (7, 5, 2)

Count of unique triangles: 24
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [24].
