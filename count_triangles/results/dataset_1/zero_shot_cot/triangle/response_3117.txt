Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. 

Let's start by identifying the triangles in the graph:

1. Possible triangle involving node 0: Not possible (only connects to node 7)
2. Possible triangle involving node 1: Not possible (only connects to node 5)
3. Possible triangle involving node 3: Not possible (only connects to node 5)
4. Possible triangle involving node 4: Not possible (only connects to node 5)
5. Triangle involving node 5: <1, 3, 4>
6. Possible triangle involving node 6: Not possible (only connects to node 5 and 7)
7. Triangle involving node 7: <0, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
