Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triangles formed by nodes connected to each other. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in a cyclic manner, i.e., node A is connected to node B, node B is connected to node C, and node C is connected to node A.

Let's list the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <2, 4, 9>
3. <3, 4, 5>
4. <4, 8, 9>
5. <1, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
