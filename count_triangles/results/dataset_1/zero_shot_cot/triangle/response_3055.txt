Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 2: <5, 6, 2>
- Triangle 3: <6, 2, 5>
- Triangle 4: <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
