Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we can consider each node and see if there are connections forming triangles. Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Node 0: Forms triangles with (1, 4, 6).
2. Node 1: Forms a triangle with (0, 9).
3. Node 2: Forms triangles with (3, 7, 8).
4. Node 3: Forms a triangle with (4, 8).
5. Node 4: Forms a triangle with (3, 0).
6. Node 5: No triangles.
7. Node 6: Forms triangles with (0, 7, 9) and (5, 7, 8).
8. Node 7: Forms a triangle with (6, 9).
9. Node 8: Forms a triangle with (2, 3, 5).
10. Node 9: No additional triangles.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, and <6, 7, 9>.
