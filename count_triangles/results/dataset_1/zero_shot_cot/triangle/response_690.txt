Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Write down all unique triangles in the graph:
(1, 3, 2)
(1, 3, 9)
(1, 3, 5)
(2, 3, 5)
(2, 3, 6)
(2, 5, 4)
(2, 5, 9)
(3, 5, 4)
(3, 5, 8)
(4, 8, 6)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = 10
