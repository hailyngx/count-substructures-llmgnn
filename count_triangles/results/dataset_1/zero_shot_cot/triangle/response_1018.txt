Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other in the graph.

1. To make it easier to visualize, let's represent the graph using a matrix where rows and columns represent nodes, and the presence of an edge between nodes is indicated by '1' in the respective cell. The matrix for this graph is as follows:

```
   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  1
2  0  0  0  0  1  0  1  0
3  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
4  1  0  0  0  0  1  0  1
5  0  1  1  0  0  0  0  0
6  0  0  0  1  0  0  1  1
7  0  1  0  0  0  1  0  1
8  1  0  0  1  0  1  1  0
```

2. Let's identify the triangles by examining each set of three nodes at a time:
   - <1, 4, 8>
   - <2, 5, 7>
   - <4, 6, 8>

3. Counting the total number of triangles, we find that there are [3] triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
