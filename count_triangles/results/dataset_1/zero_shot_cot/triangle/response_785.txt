Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles:
1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <1, 3, 5>
4. <2, 3, 5>
5. <2, 3, 6>
6. <2, 7, 9>
7. <3, 5, 6>
8. <4, 7, 9>
9. <7, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
