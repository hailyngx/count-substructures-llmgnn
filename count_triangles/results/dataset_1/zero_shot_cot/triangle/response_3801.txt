Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles present in the given graph:
1. <3, 4, 7>
2. <3, 6, 7>
3. <4, 5, 7>
4. <5, 6, 7>

Now, count the total number of triangles in brackets:
[4]
