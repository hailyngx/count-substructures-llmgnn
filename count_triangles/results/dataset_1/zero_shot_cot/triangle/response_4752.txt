Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other, such as node A connected to B, B connected to C, and C connected to A.

In this graph, the triangles are as follows:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <0, 7, 5>
4. <0, 8, 3>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
