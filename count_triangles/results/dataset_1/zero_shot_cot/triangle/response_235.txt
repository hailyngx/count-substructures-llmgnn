Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First of all, let's identify the triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to each other forming a closed loop.

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle 4: <0, 7, 3>
- Triangle 5: <0, 7, 4>
- Triangle 6: <0, 9, 2>
- Triangle 7: <4, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
