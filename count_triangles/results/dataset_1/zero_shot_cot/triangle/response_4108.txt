Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, let's count the total number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9. This creates a triangle <0, 3, 5>.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 8, but there is no third node connecting all three.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9. This creates three triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, and <3, 5, 8>.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 8, but there is no third node connecting all three.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 7. This creates two triangles: <0, 3, 5> and <5, 6, 7>.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9. This creates a triangle <5, 6, 7>.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 6, but there is no third node connecting all three.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9. This creates a triangle <3, 5, 8>.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, and 8. This creates two triangles: <0, 3, 9> and <5, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
