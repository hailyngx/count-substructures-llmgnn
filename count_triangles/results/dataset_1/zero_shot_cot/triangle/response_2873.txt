Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all combinations of three nodes that are each connected to each other.

Looking at the edges provided:

1. Nodes 0, 1, and 2 form a triangle: <0, 1, 2>.
2. Nodes 0, 2, and 7 form a triangle: <0, 2, 7>.
3. Nodes 1, 2, and 5 form a triangle: <1, 2, 5>.
4. Nodes 2, 6, and 7 form a triangle: <2, 6, 7>.
5. Nodes 2, 6, and 8 form a triangle: <2, 6, 8>.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
