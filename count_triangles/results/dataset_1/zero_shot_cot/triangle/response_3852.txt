Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 4.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9.
6. Node 7 is connected to node 5.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
6. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
7. Triangle <0, 8, 2>
8. Triangle <0, 8, 5>
9. Triangle <0, 9, 1>
10. Triangle <0, 9, 5>
11. Triangle <1, 9, 5>
12. Triangle <2, 8, 5>
13. Triangle <4, 0, 3>
14. Triangle <5, 0, 7>
15. Triangle <5, 0, 8>
16. Triangle <5, 0, 9>
17. Triangle <5, 7, 0>
18. Triangle <5, 8, 0>
19. Triangle <5, 9, 0>
20. Triangle <8, 0, 2>
21. Triangle <8, 0, 5>
22. Triangle <8, 2, 5>
23. Triangle <8, 5, 0>
24. Triangle <9, 0, 1>
25. Triangle <9, 0, 5>
26. Triangle <9, 1, 5>
27. Triangle <9, 5, 0>
28. Triangle <9, 5, 1>

Therefore, there are [28] triangles in the given graph.
