Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 3
- Node 2: degree = 2
- Node 3: degree = 3
- Node 4: degree = 3
- Node 5: degree = 3
- Node 6: degree = 3
- Node 7: degree = 2
- Node 8: degree = 3
- Node 9: degree = 3

Step 2: Count the number of triangles by checking each set of 3 nodes that form a triangle.
- <0, 1, 3>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <6, 8, 9>
