Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's verify each possible triangle:

1. Triangle: <3, 4, 6>
2. Triangle: <3, 4, 9>
3. Triangle: <4, 6, 7>
4. Triangle: <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
