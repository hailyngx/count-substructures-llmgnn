Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 9, 5>
<2, 9, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Counting the unique triangles, we find that there are a total of **8 triangles** in the given graph.  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is **[8]**.
