Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 5.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9.
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
5. Node 6 is connected to node 3.
6. Node 7 is connected to node 9.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 5, 8
- Triangle 2: Nodes 3, 5, 8
- Triangle 3: Nodes 3, 5, 1 (this triangle is formed indirectly through nodes 3, 5, 1)
- Triangle 4: Nodes 3, 5, 0 (this triangle is formed indirectly through nodes 3, 5, 0)
- Triangle 5: Nodes 3, 5, 9
- Triangle 6: Nodes 3, 5, 6 (this triangle is formed indirectly through nodes 3, 5, 6)
- Triangle 7: Nodes 3, 8, 0
- Triangle 8: Nodes 3, 8, 5
- Triangle 9: Nodes 3, 8, 1 (this triangle is formed indirectly through nodes 3, 8, 1)
- Triangle 10: Nodes 3, 8, 9
- Triangle 11: Nodes 0, 5, 1
- Triangle 12: Nodes 0, 5, 9
- Triangle 13: Nodes 5, 1, 3
- Triangle 14: Nodes 5, 9, 3
- Triangle 15: Nodes 8, 0, 3
- Triangle 16: Nodes 8, 5, 3
- Triangle 17: Nodes 8, 1, 3

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17]. The unique triangles are <0, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 1>, <3, 5, 0>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 8, 0>, <3, 8, 5>, <3, 8, 1>, <3, 8, 9>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 9>, <5, 1, 3>, <5, 9, 3>, <8, 0, 3>, <8, 5, 3>, <8, 1, 3>.
