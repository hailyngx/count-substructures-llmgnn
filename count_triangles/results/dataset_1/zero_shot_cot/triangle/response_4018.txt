Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Here is the step-by-step process to find the total number of triangles:

1. Look at each node and its adjacent nodes to identify potential triangles.

2. Identify unique triangles formed by three interconnected nodes in the graph.

3. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

Let's start by listing down the unique triangles we find: 

1. <1, 4, 6>
2. <1, 5, 9>
3. <2, 4, 8>
4. <3, 5, 9>
5. <6, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
