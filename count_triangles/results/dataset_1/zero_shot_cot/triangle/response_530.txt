Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8.

Now, let's find the triangles:
1. Triangles involving node 0: <0, 2, 4> <0, 2, 5> <0, 4, 5> <0, 5, 6>
2. Triangles involving node 1: <1, 2, 4> <1, 2, 7> <1, 4, 6>
3. Triangles involving node 2: <0, 2, 4>
4. Triangles involving node 6: <0, 6, 9>
5. Triangles involving node 7: <1, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in this graph.
