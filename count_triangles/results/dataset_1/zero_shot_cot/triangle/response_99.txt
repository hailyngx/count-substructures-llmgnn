Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step. 

1. Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6, 9}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {0}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {3, 9}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 7}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {1, 6}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {3}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 5}

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. Triangles involving node 0: 
   - <0, 1, 2>
   - <0, 2, 3>
   
2. Triangles involving node 1: 
   - No triangles with node 1
   
3. Triangles involving node 2: 
   - No triangles with node 2

4. Triangles involving node 3:
   - <0, 2, 3>
   - <3, 5, 9>
   - <3, 6, 7>
   - <3, 6, 9>

5. Triangles involving node 4: 
   - No triangles with node 4

6. Triangles involving node 5: 
   - <3, 5, 9>
   
7. Triangles involving node 6: 
   - <0, 2, 3>
   - <3, 6, 7>
   - <3, 6, 9>

8. Triangles involving node 7: 
   - <3, 6, 7>

9. Triangles involving node 8: 
   - No triangles with node 8

10. Triangles involving node 9: 
   - <0, 2, 3>
   - <3, 5, 9>
   - <3, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [6]
