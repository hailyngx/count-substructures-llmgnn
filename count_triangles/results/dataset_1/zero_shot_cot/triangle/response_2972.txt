Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all possible triangles in the graph.

Let's list down the triangles:
1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 4, 1>
3. <0, 7, 6>
4. <3, 7, 6>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
