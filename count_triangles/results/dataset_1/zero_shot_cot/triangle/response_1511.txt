Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

Let's start by listing all the triangles we can find in this graph:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <2, 3, 9>
4. <4, 2, 9>
5. <3, 6, 9>
6. <6, 7, 8>
7. <8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
