Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles by checking all three-node combinations that form a closed loop.
2. Check if each identified triangle is actually present in the given edges list.

Let's start identifying the triangles:

1. Possible triangles involving node 0: (0, 5, 7) (0, 6, 9) (0, 8, 9)
2. Possible triangles involving node 1: (1, 6, 7)
3. Possible triangles involving node 5: (5, 6, 7)
4. Possible triangles involving node 6: (6, 7, 9)
5. Possible triangles involving node 7: (7, 8, 9)

Now, let's check which of these triangles are actually present in the given edges:

Triangles Found:
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <7, 8, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
