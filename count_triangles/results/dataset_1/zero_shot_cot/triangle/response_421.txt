Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will identify all the triangles in the graph by checking for each set of three nodes if they form a triangle. A triangle is formed when all three nodes are connected to each other.

Next, let's list all the triangles in the graph. Once we have all the unique triangles, we will count them.

The triangles in this graph are:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <1, 0, 4>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <3, 1, 7>
6. <3, 4, 7>
7. <3, 7, 5>
8. <8, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
