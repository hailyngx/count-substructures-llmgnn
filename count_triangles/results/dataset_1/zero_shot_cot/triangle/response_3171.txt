Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After carefully examining the given graph based on the edges provided, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 5, 2>
4. <0, 7, 9>
5. <2, 5, 9>
6. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
