Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
1. Let's analyze each node and its neighbors to find triangles:
- Node 0: Neighbors are [1, 5, 9]
- Node 1: Neighbors are [0, 2, 3, 4, 8]
- Node 2: Neighbors are [1, 3, 5]
- Node 3: Neighbors are [1, 2, 9]
- Node 4: Neighbors are [1, 8]
- Node 5: Neighbors are [0, 2, 6, 8]
- Node 6: Neighbors are [5, 7, 9]
- Node 7: Neighbor is [6]
- Node 8: Neighbors are [1, 4, 5]
- Node 9: Neighbors are [0, 3, 6]

2. Now let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 2: <1, 2, 3>
- Triangle 3: <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle 4: <5, 6, 9>

3. Total number of triangles: [4]
