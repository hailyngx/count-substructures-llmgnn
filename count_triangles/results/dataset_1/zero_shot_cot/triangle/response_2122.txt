Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly.

Given edges:
(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 1), (9, 2)

Let's list the unique triangles:
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 7, 9>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
