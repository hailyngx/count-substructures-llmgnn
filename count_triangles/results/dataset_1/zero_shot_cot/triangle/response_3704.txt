Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected. In this case, we will list down all the unique triangles first:

1. <1, 2, 9>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <1, 6, 7>

Now that we have identified all the unique triangles, we can see that there are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
