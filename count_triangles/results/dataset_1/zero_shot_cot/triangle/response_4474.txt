Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 7 and the unique triangles are <4, 0, 1>, <4, 0, 9>, <5, 2, 9>, <8, 0, 9>, <8, 3, 6>, <8, 5, 6>, and <9, 4, 7>. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
