Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 --- 5
   /       \
  6         7 -- 3
   \       / \   |
    0 --- 2   9  8
                 |
                 4
```

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can examine each possible triangle combination. Here are the unique triangles present in this graph:

1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <0, 7, 8>
3. <1, 5, 6>
4. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
