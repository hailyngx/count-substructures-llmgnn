Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Nodes with at least 2 connections: Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have at least 2 connections each. 

2. For each node with at least 2 connections, we will look at the possible triangles it can form with its connected nodes.

- Node 0: Connected to node 7.
- Node 2: Connected to node 9.
- Node 3: Connected to node 7.
- Node 4: Connected to node 5.
- Node 5: Connected to node 4.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 7.

3. Based on the connections, we find the following unique triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 7, 3>
- Triangle 2: <4, 5, 4>
- Triangle 3: <7, 0, 7>
- Triangle 4: <7, 3, 7>
- Triangle 5: <7, 9, 2>
- Triangle 6: <9, 2, 9>
- Triangle 7: <9, 7, 0>

Counting the total number of triangles = 7

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
