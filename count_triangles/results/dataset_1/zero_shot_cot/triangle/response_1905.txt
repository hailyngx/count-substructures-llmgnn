Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, let's identify the triangles using the given edges:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - <0, 1, 7>
   - <0, 4, 5>
   - <0, 6, 7>

2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - <1, 0, 7>
   
3. Triangles involving node 2:
   No triangles involving node 2.

4. Triangles involving node 3:
   - <1, 3, 4>

5. Triangles involving node 4:
   - <0, 1, 4>
   - <0, 4, 5>

6. Triangles involving node 5:
   No triangles involving node 5.

7. Triangles involving node 6:
   No triangles involving node 6.

8. Triangles involving node 7:
   - <0, 1, 7>
   
9. Triangles involving node 8:
   No triangles involving node 8.

10. Triangles involving node 9:
   No triangles involving node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
