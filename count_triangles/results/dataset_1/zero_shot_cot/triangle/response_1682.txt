Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes connected by edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected in a closed loop. Let's go through the edges to identify the triangles:

1. For node 0: (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9) - No triangles can be formed with node 0.
2. For node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5) - Triangle <1, 2, 5>.
3. For node 2: (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6) - Triangle <1, 2, 5>.
4. For node 3: (3, 1), (3, 8) - No triangles can be formed with node 3.
5. For node 4: (4, 5), (4, 6) - No triangles can be formed with node 4.
6. For node 5: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 9) - No additional triangles can be formed with node 5.
7. For node 6: (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 9) - No triangles can be formed with node 6.
8. For node 7: (7, 0) - No triangles can be formed with node 7.
9. For node 8: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 9) - No triangles can be formed with node 8.
10. For node 9: (9, 0), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8) - No additional triangles can be formed with node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
