Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in this graph:
- Triangle 1: (0, 5, 7)
- Triangle 2: (0, 7, 8)
- Triangle 3: (1, 2, 7)
- Triangle 4: (1, 2, 9)
- Triangle 5: (1, 4, 5)
- Triangle 6: (1, 7, 9)
- Triangle 7: (2, 6, 3)
- Triangle 8: (2, 6, 7)
- Triangle 9: (2, 7, 9)
- Triangle 10: (3, 6, 7)
- Triangle 11: (3, 7, 8)
- Triangle 12: (4, 5, 7)
- Triangle 13: (4, 5, 9)
- Triangle 14: (5, 7, 9)

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in total. So, the number of triangles in this graph is [14].
