Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

- Triangle 1: (1, 2, 6)
- Triangle 2: (2, 6, 9)
- Triangle 3: (2, 9, 3)
- Triangle 4: (6, 9, 3)

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph: <1, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 9, 3>, and <6, 9, 3>.
