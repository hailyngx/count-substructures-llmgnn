Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, and <2, 3, 9>.
