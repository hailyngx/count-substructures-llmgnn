Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles present in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
3. Triangle <5, 6, 9>
4. Triangle <6, 8, 9>
5. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
6. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
7. Triangle <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
