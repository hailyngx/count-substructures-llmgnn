Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

First, let's list all the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <2, 1, 3>
4. <2, 3, 6>
5. <3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
