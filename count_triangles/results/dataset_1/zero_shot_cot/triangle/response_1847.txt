Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we can represent the given graph in a matrix form to visually see the connections:

```
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
  +---------------------
0 | 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 | 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
2 | 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
3 | 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1
4 | 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
5 | 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
6 | 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
7 | 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
8 | 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
9 | 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
```

Next, we will count the total number of triangles in the graph.

Let's denote the nodes as follows:  
0: A  
1: B  
2: C  
3: D  
4: E  
5: F  
6: G  
7: H  
8: I  
9: J  

Now, let's go through each possible triangle:

1. Triangle <A, C, F>
2. Triangle <A, F, J>
3. Triangle <B, D, F>
4. Triangle <D, F, J>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
