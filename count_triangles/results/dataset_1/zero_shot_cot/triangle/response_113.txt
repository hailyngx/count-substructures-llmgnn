Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible sets of three nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the possible triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <1, 4, 9>
4. <3, 4, 5>
5. <3, 4, 6>
6. <3, 5, 7>
7. <3, 6, 7>
8. <5, 6, 7>
9. <0, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
