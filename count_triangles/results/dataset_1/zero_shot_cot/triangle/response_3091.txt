Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by the edges provided. 

Let's list down the triangles:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 6, 5>
4. <4, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
