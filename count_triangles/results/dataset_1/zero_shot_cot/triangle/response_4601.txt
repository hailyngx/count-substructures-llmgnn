Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 6
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 6
- Node 9 has degree 5

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles using the number of common neighbors between each pair of nodes.
- For example, node 0, 2, 5 form a triangle as they are all connected to node 8.
- Similarly, there are more triangles as follows: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 9, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 9, 2>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 9, 5>, <5, 8, 2>, <5, 9, 2>

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in total.
