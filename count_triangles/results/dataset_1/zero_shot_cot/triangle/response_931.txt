Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. From the given edges, let's identify all the triangles:

- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 2)
- Triangle 2: (0, 1, 5)
- Triangle 3: (0, 1, 8)
- Triangle 4: (0, 2, 5)
- Triangle 5: (1, 2, 5)

2. Calculate the total number of triangles:

[5] 

Therefore, there are 5 unique triangles in the given graph.
