Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can start by looking at each unique set of 3 nodes that are interconnected.

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
