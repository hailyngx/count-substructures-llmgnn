Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's look for all possible triangles formed by any three nodes connected by edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by three edges to each other.

After analyzing the given graph, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
