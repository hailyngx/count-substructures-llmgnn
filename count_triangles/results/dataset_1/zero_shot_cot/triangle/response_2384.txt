Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each possible triangle formed by the nodes and see if all three edges exist. 

Let's list the unique triangles found:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 9>

Counting the number of triangles, we have:
[4]
