Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We can determine the number of triangles in the graph by finding all possible triangles formed by the nodes. We do this by checking all combinations of three nodes and determining if there is an edge between each pair of nodes.

Considering each triangle only once, we can find the following unique triangles in the graph:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
