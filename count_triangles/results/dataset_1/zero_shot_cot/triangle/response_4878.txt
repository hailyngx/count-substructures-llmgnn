Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for closed loops of length 3. Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle: <1, 2, 8>
2. Triangle: <1, 4, 6>
3. Triangle: <1, 6, 5>
4. Triangle: <2, 1, 4>
5. Triangle: <2, 1, 6>
6. Triangle: <2, 4, 8>
7. Triangle: <2, 8, 9>
8. Triangle: <4, 1, 6>
9. Triangle: <4, 1, 9>
10. Triangle: <4, 8, 9>

There are 10 triangles in total. So, the total number of triangles is [10].
