Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the triangles present in this graph:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <2, 5, 7>
3. <2, 5, 9>
4. <5, 6, 7>
5. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
