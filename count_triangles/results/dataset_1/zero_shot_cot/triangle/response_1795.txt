Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. List out all triangles using the given edges:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 3, 8)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 3, 9)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 5, 8)
   - Triangle 4: (0, 5, 6)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 4, 6)
   - Triangle 6: (2, 4, 9)
   - Triangle 7: (2, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 8: (2, 8, 9)
   - Triangle 9: (3, 4, 9)
   - Triangle 10: (5, 4, 6)
   - Triangle 11: (5, 4, 9)

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:
   - Total unique triangles: 11

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
