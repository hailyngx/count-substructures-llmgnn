Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Given the edges provided, we see that there are 4 triangles in the graph.
The triangles are: <0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <5, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
