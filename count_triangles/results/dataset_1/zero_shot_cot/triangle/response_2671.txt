Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle involving three nodes and see if there are edges connecting all three nodes.

Let's list the unique triangles in the graph:

1. <1, 3, 7>
2. <1, 3, 2>
3. <1, 3, 9>
4. <1, 7, 8>
5. <2, 3, 5>
6. <2, 3, 9>
7. <3, 4, 9>
8. <3, 4, 6>
9. <4, 5, 8>
10. <4, 5, 6>
11. <7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
