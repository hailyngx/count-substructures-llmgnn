Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. Let's do this step by step:

1. Identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 6)
- Triangle 2: (0, 3, 7)
- Triangle 3: (0, 3, 9)
- Triangle 4: (0, 6, 1)
- Triangle 5: (0, 9, 1)
- Triangle 6: (2, 3, 6)
- Triangle 7: (2, 3, 9)
- Triangle 8: (2, 6, 5)
- Triangle 9: (3, 5, 6)
- Triangle 10: (4, 8, 9)

2. Count the total number of unique triangles found: 
- Total number of triangles: [10]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
