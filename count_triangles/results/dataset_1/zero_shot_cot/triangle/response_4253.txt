Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the three connected nodes.

Identifying the triangles:
1. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
