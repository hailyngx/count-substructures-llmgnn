Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangles involving node 0: None
2. Triangles involving node 1: None
3. Triangles involving node 2: None
4. Triangles involving node 3: None
5. Triangles involving node 4: None
6. Triangles involving node 5: None
7. Triangles involving node 6: None
8. Triangles involving node 7: None
9. Triangles involving node 8: None
10. Triangles involving node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is 0. So, the answer is [0].
