Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by connecting nodes with edges. We can do this step-by-step:

1. Identify all the triangles by checking each combination of three nodes that are connected by edges.
2. List the unique triangles found by their node numbers inside <> brackets.
3. Finally, count the total number of unique triangles.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 5>
<4, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
