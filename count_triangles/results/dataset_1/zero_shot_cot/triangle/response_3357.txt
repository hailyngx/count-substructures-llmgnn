Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the steps we can follow:

1. Look for nodes that have at least two edges connecting them to other nodes.
2. Check if those nodes are connected by a third edge to form a triangle.

Let's go through each pair of nodes to find the triangles:

- Possible triangles involving node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 7, 4)
- Possible triangles involving node 1: (1, 0, 7), (1, 3, 4)
- Possible triangles involving node 2: (2, 4, 7)
- Possible triangles involving node 3: (3, 1, 4), (3, 4, 7), (3, 4, 9)
- Possible triangles involving node 4: (4, 1, 7), (4, 2, 7)
- Possible triangles involving node 7: (7, 0, 4)
- No triangles can be formed with nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9 as they do not have sets of three connected nodes.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7] (only one unique triangle was found: <0, 1, 4>).
