Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's begin by identifying the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 9, 4>
3. Triangle <3, 7, 6>
4. Triangle <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
