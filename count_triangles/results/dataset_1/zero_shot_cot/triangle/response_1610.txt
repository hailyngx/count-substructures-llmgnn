Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triplets of nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other forming a closed loop.

Let's list the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 5, 3>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 9, 7>
4. <1, 3, 5>
5. <1, 3, 9>
6. <1, 6, 2>
7. <1, 6, 8>
8. <2, 6, 8>
9. <2, 8, 4>
10. <2, 8, 6>
11. <2, 9, 0>
12. <3, 5, 0>
13. <3, 5, 9>
14. <3, 9, 7>
15. <6, 1, 8>
16. <6, 2, 8>
17. <6, 8, 4>
18. <8, 1, 3>
19. <8, 1, 6>
20. <8, 1, 4>
21. <8, 2, 6>
22. <8, 2, 4>
23. <9, 0, 7>
24. <9, 2, 0>
25. <9, 2, 7>
26. <9, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [26].
