Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Triangle is a closed figure with three sides.
- To form a triangle, we need three connected nodes.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Nodes forming a triangle: (0, 1, 5)
2. Nodes forming a triangle: (0, 5, 8)
3. Nodes forming a triangle: (1, 0, 7)
4. Nodes forming a triangle: (2, 4, 9)
5. Nodes forming a triangle: (3, 5, 9)
6. Nodes forming a triangle: (6, 7, 8)

Total number of triangles: [6]
