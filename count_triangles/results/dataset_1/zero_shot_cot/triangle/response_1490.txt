Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. Here are the triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <2, 5, 6>
5. <3, 5, 8>
6. <3, 7, 8>
7. <4, 7, 9>
8. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
