Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [\[14\]]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 3>, <4, 6, 5>, <2, 7, 9>, <1, 0, 3>, <1, 7, 2>, <3, 8, 1>, <3, 7, 2>.
