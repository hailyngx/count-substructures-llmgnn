Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify triangles by checking each unique combination of 3 nodes:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
- Triangle 2: (0, 2, 9)
- Triangle 3: (2, 8, 9)
