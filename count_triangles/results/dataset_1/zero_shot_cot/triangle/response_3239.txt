Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <1, 5, 6>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <5, 6, 8>
5. <6, 8, 9>

So, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
