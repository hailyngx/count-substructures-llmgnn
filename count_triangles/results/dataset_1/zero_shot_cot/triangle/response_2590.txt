Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's denote the nodes numerically as:
Node 0: 0
Node 1: 1
Node 2: 2
Node 3: 3
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 5
Node 6: 6
Node 7: 7
Node 8: 8
Node 9: 9

Now, let's identify the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
