Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible sets of three nodes that are all interconnected with each other.

Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 6, 2>
5. Triangle <3, 1, 4>
6. Triangle <4, 0, 3>
7. Triangle <4, 3, 8>
8. Triangle <5, 1, 8>
9. Triangle <8, 4, 5>

Hence, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the output is [9].
