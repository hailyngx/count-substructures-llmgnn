Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all the triangles formed by the edges provided. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 4, and 8.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 4 and 8.
3. Node 2 doesn't form any triangles.
4. Node 3 doesn't form any triangles.
5. Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 5 and 9.
6. Node 5 doesn't form any triangles.
7. Node 6 doesn't form any triangles.
8. Node 7 doesn't form any triangles.
9. Node 8 doesn't form any triangles.
10. Node 9 doesn't form any triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, and <1, 4, 9>.
