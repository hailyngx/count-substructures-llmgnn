Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] triangles in this graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 5, 9>.
