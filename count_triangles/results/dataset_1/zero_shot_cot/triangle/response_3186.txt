Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the triangles formed by each node.
- Node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 7), (0, 1, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 7), (1, 0, 9)
- Node 2: No triangles as all edges connect to nodes outside {6, 9}.
- Node 3: No triangles as all edges connect to nodes outside {4, 6}.
- Node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 3)
- Node 5: (5, 0, 1)
- Node 6: No triangles as all edges connect to nodes outside {2, 3, 9}.
- Node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 0, 9)
- Node 8: No triangles as all edges connect to nodes outside {1}.
- Node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 0, 2), (9, 0, 6), (9, 0, 7)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.
- Total Triangles = 4 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 1) + 2 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 5) + 2 (from Node 7) + 4 (from Node 9) = 17

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17]. 

Unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <4, 0, 1>, <4, 0, 3>, <5, 0, 1>, <7, 0, 1>, <7, 0, 9>, <9, 0, 1>, <9, 0, 2>, <9, 0, 6>, <9, 0, 7>.
