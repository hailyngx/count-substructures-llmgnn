Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that form a triangle. A triangle exists when each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <1, 2, 6>

After considering all combinations of connected nodes, we find that there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
