Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 4>.
