Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

- Triangle 1: <1, 7, 9>
- Triangle 2: <2, 4, 6>

Thus, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
