Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each unique set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Counting the triangles:
   a. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 8.
   b. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 8.
   c. Node 2 does not form any triangle as it has only one neighbor.
   d. Node 3 does not form any triangle as it has only one neighbor.
   e. Node 4 does not form any triangle as it has only one neighbor.
   f. Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 7.
   g. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 8.
   h. Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 5.
   i. Node 8 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 1.
   j. Node 9 does not form any triangle as it has only one neighbor.

2. Listing the unique triangles:
   - <0, 3, 8>
   - <1, 4, 8>
   - <2, 5, 7>
   - <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
