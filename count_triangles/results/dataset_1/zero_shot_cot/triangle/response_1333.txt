Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <0, 2, 9>
5. <4, 6, 7> 

Total number of triangles: [5]
