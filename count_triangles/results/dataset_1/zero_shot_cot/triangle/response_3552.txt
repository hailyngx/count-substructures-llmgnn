Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's analyze each possible triangle pair by pair of nodes:

1. For node 0:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 3)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 1, 6)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 3, 6)
   - Triangle 4: (0, 1, 9)
   - Triangle 5: (0, 6, 9)

2. For node 1:
   - Triangle 6: (1, 2, 6)
   - Triangle 7: (1, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 8: (1, 5, 6)
   - Triangle 9: (1, 5, 9)

3. For node 2:
   - No triangle possible with existing edges.

4. For node 3:
   - No triangle possible with existing edges.

5. For node 4:
   - Triangle 10: (4, 5, 7)
   - Triangle 11: (4, 5, 8)

6. For node 5:
   - No triangle possible with existing edges.

7. For node 6:
   - No triangle possible with existing edges.

8. For node 7:
   - No triangle possible with existing edges.

9. For node 8:
   - Triangle 12: (8, 9, 1)

10. For node 9:
   - No triangle possible with existing edges.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in total in this graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <8, 9, 1> 

So, the total number of triangles in this graph is [12].
