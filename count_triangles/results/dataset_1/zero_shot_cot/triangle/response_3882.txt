Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique set of nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected in a closed loop. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Look for nodes connected to each other:
   - (0, 3)
   - (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 8)
   - (3, 0), (3, 8), (3, 9)
   - (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)
   - (5, 1), (5, 8)
   - (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 9)
   - (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)
   - (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 7)

2. Identify the triangles:
   - <1, 2, 8>
   - <1, 7, 9>
   - <3, 4, 9>
   - <4, 7, 9>
   - <1, 5, 8>
   - <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are total [6] triangles in this graph.
