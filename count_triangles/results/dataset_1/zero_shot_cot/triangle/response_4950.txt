Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle involving three nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: None.
2. Nodes connected to node 1: None.
3. Nodes connected to node 2: Nodes 0, 3, 7, 8.
4. Nodes connected to node 3: Nodes 2, 6.
5. Nodes connected to node 4: Nodes 5, 7, 9.
6. Nodes connected to node 5: Node 4.
7. Nodes connected to node 6: Nodes 3, 9.
8. Nodes connected to node 7: Nodes 2, 4.
9. Nodes connected to node 8: Node 2.
10. Nodes connected to node 9: Nodes 4, 6.

Now, let's look for the triangles:

1. Triangles involving node 0: None.
2. Triangles involving node 1: None.
3. Triangles involving node 2: <2, 7, 4>.
4. Triangles involving node 3: None.
5. Triangles involving node 4: None.
6. Triangles involving node 5: None.
7. Triangles involving node 6: None.
8. Triangles involving node 7: <7, 4, 2>.
9. Triangles involving node 8: None.
10. Triangles involving node 9: None.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <2, 7, 4> and <7, 4, 2>.
