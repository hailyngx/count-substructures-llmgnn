Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. 
2. We will iterate through all possible combinations of three nodes from the given graph and check if they form a triangle.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
