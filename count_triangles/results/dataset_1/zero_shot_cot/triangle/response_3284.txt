Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every possible triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges.

Let's list the unique triangles and then count the total number of triangles:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 7, 8>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <1, 7, 9>
5. <7, 4, 6>
6. <0, 1, 9>

Count of triangles: [6]
