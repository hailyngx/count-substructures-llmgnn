Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles based on the edges provided. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <1, 6, 8>
5. <3, 4, 8>
6. <3, 4, 8>
7. <4, 8, 3>
8. <4, 8, 7>
9. <8, 7, 1>
10. <8, 7, 1>

Thus, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
