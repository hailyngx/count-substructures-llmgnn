Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every triplet of nodes that form a closed loop of edges between them. 

Here are the triangles present in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <0, 7, 8>
5. <4, 7, 9>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
