Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the triangles
From the given edges, we can see that the possible triangles are formed by the following sets of nodes:
1. (0, 4, 9)
2. (0, 5, 9)
3. (2, 5, 8)
4. (2, 5, 1)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

Therefore, the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, and <2, 5, 1>.
