Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph with its edges listed, we can count the number of triangles by identifying the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected.

The triangles in this graph are:
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
