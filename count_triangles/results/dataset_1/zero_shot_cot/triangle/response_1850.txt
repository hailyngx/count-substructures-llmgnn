Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually adjacent. In other words, we need to find all triangles in the graph.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <2, 4, 6>
5. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
