Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. (2, 3, 4)
2. (2, 4, 7)
3. (2, 4, 9)
4. (2, 9, 7)
5. (4, 7, 9)

So, there are 5 triangles in total. Hence, the output is [5].
