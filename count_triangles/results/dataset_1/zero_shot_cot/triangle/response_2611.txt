Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 1)
- Triangle 2: (0, 2, 3)
- Triangle 3: (0, 3, 5)
- Triangle 4: (0, 9, 1)
- Triangle 5: (0, 9, 4)
- Triangle 6: (2, 1, 9)
- Triangle 7: (2, 3, 5)
- Triangle 8: (4, 8, 5)
- Triangle 9: (4, 9, 6)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in brackets:
