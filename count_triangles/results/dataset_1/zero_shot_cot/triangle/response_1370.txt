Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, and <8, 9, 7>.
