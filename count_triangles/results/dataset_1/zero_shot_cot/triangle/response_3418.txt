Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in a graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's go step-by-step to find the total number of triangles in this graph.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 7.

Let's list out the unique triangles we find:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 2, 8>
5. <4, 6, 9>
6. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
