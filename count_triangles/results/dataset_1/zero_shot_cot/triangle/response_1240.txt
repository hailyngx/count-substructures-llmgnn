Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph for better understanding.

The graph can be represented as:

```
      1 --- 5
     /|\    |\
    / | \   | \
   0--3--4--6--9
     / \   |
    /   \  |
   2     7 8
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the possible triangles:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <1, 5, 9>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <3, 7, 9>
7. <5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
