Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify all the triangles present.
Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<1, 2, 4>
<3, 5, 0>
<8, 6, 9>
