Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each unique set of three nodes that form a triangle. Let's start by listing out the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <1, 2, 8>
5. <1, 2, 9>
6. <1, 8, 9>
7. <2, 3, 8>
8. <3, 4, 5>
9. <3, 5, 8>
10. <3, 8, 9>

Count of triangles: [10]
