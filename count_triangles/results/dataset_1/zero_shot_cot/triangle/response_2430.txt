Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in this graph. So, the output is [6].
