Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine all possible triangles formed by the edges given. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected.

By looking at the given edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
1. <1, 6, 8>
2. <1, 9, 3>
3. <1, 9, 4>
4. <2, 3, 9>
5. <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
