Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, the total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles are: <2, 3, 4>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>.
