Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's count the triangles step by step:

1. For node 0:
   - (0, 2, 6)
   - (0, 2, 7)
   - (0, 6, 7)
   - (0, 2, 9)
   - (0, 7, 9)
   This gives us 5 triangles involving node 0.

2. For node 1:
   - (1, 5, 8)
   - (1, 7, 8)
   This gives us 2 triangles involving node 1.

3. For node 2:
   - (0, 2, 8)
   This gives us 1 triangle involving node 2.

4. For node 4:
   - (4, 8, 9)
   This gives us 1 triangle involving node 4.

5. For node 5:
   - No triangles as all connections only form pairs.

6. For node 6:
   - (0, 6, 7)
   - (6, 7, 8)
   This gives us 2 triangles involving node 6.

7. For node 7:
   - (0, 7, 8)
   This gives us 1 triangle involving node 7.

8. For node 8:
   - (1, 8, 5)
   - (1, 8, 7)
   - (2, 8, 4)
   - (2, 8, 5)
   - (2, 8, 6)
   - (4, 8, 9)
   - (5, 8, 6)
   - (5, 8, 7)
   This gives us 8 triangles involving node 8.

9. For node 9:
   - No triangles as all connections only form pairs.

Adding up all the triangles counted above: 5 (0) + 2 (1) + 1 (2) + 1 (4) + 2 (6) + 1 (7) + 8 (8) = 20 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 8, 7>, <2, 8, 4>, <2, 8, 5>, <2, 8, 6>, <5, 8, 6>, <5, 8, 7>.
