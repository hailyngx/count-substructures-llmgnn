Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every unique set of three nodes that are all interconnected. 

Given the list of edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
