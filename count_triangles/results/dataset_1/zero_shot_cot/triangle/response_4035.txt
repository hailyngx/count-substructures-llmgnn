Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph.

From the given list of edges, we can identify the following triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 7)
- Triangle 2: (0, 1, 8)
- Triangle 3: (0, 4, 8)
- Triangle 4: (1, 7, 8)
- Triangle 5: (8, 2, 9)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<8, 2, 9>
