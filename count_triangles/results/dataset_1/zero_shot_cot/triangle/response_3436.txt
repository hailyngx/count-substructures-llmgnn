Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges given. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 1.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 2.

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. Triangles including Node 0: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>
2. Triangles including Node 1: None
3. Triangles including Node 2: None
4. Triangles including Node 3: None
5. Triangles including Node 4: None
6. Triangles including Node 5: <4, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 7>
7. Triangles including Node 6: None
8. Triangles including Node 7: None
9. Triangles including Node 8: None
10. Triangles including Node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
