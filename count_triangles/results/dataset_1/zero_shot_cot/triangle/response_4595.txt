Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step to find the total number of triangles:

1. Identify the triangles:
   - <0, 1, 7>
   - <1, 4, 7>
   - <3, 4, 9>
   - <4, 5, 8>
   - <4, 6, 9>

2. Calculate the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: [5]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
