Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. 

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <4, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
