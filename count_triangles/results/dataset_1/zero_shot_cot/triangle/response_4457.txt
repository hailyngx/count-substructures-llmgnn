Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the number of triangles:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, so it forms a triangle <0, 5, x>.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 6, so it forms a triangle <2, 5, 6>.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 9.  
   - It forms triangles <3, 4, x> and <3, 7, 8>.  
   - It forms a triangle <3, 6, 9>.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 8, so it forms a triangle <3, 4, 8>.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6.  
   - It forms triangles <0, 5, x> and <2, 5, 6>.  
   - It forms a triangle <5, 6, 9>.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 8, 9.  
   - It forms triangles <2, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 9> and <5, 6, 9>.  
   - It forms a triangle <6, 8, x>.  
7. Node 7 is not part of any triangles.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, so it forms a triangle <3, 4, 8>.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, so it forms a triangle <3, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
