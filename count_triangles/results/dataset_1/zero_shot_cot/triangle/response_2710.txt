Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify all unique triangles formed by the connected nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Triangle (0, 2, 9)
2. Triangle (1, 3, 2)
3. Triangle (1, 3, 9)
4. Triangle (2, 3, 4)
5. Triangle (2, 4, 5)
6. Triangle (2, 6, 5)
7. Triangle (3, 4, 5)
8. Triangle (3, 4, 9)
9. Triangle (4, 5, 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
