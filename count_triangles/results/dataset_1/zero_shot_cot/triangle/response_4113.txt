Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles by considering each triplet of nodes connected by edges.

The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <2, 6, 8>
5. <2, 7, 8>
6. <2, 8, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
