Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles and list them step-by-step in the given graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to node 7.
   - No triangles can be formed with node 0.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 5.
   - No triangles can be formed with node 1.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 9.
   - Possible triangles involving node 2: <2, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 9>.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8.
   - Possible triangles involving node 3: <2, 3, 5>.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 3.
   - No triangles can be formed with node 4.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
   - No triangles can be formed with node 5.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 8.
   - No triangles can be formed with node 6.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
   - Possible triangles involving node 7: <0, 2, 3>.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
   - Possible triangles involving node 8: <2, 8, 9>.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
   - Possible triangles involving node 9: <2, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <2, 3, 5>, <2, 7, 9>, and <2, 8, 9>.
