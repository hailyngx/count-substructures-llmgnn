Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Here are the steps to calculate the total number of triangles:

1. Identify the triangles by looking at each node and checking if there are two edges that connect it to other nodes that are also connected. 
2. Count each unique triangle that appears in the graph.

After examining the graph, we find the following triangles: 
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
