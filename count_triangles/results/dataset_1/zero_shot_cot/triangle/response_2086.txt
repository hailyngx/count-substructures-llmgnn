Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Count the number of triangles by examining each node with its neighbors to see if a triangle is formed.
    
    For each node:
    Node 0: (0, 3, 5, 6, 7)
    Node 2: (2, 3, 5)
    Node 3: (0, 2, 4, 5)
    Node 4: (3, 5, 6)
    Node 5: (0, 2, 3, 4, 8)
    Node 6: (0, 4)
    Node 7: (0, 8)
    Node 8: (5, 7)
    
    Triangles found: <0, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 8>
    
Step 2: Output the total number of triangles found.

    Total number of triangles: [3]
