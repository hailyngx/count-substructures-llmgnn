Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to Node 0: {1, 7, 8}
2. Nodes connected to Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 8}
3. Nodes connected to Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 6}
4. Nodes connected to Node 3: {4, 8, 9}
5. Nodes connected to Node 4: {2, 3, 5}
6. Nodes connected to Node 5: {2, 4}
7. Nodes connected to Node 6: {1, 2, 9}
8. Nodes connected to Node 7: {0, 8, 9}
9. Nodes connected to Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 7}
10. Nodes connected to Node 9: {3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the triangles present in the graph:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle 2: <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle 3: <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle 4: <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
