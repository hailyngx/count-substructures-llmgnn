Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <1, 3, 8>
4. <2, 1, 8>
5. <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
