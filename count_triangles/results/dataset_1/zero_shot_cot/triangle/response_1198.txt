Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Look for all possible triangles formed by three connected nodes.
2. Check each of the triangles to see if they are indeed triangles in the graph.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Possible triangles with nodes:
   - (1, 2, 5)
   - (1, 2, 6)
   - (1, 3, 6)
   - (1, 4, 9)
   - (1, 5, 9)
   - (2, 5, 9)
   - (2, 6, 7)
   - (2, 6, 9)

2. Checking for valid triangles:
   - <1, 2, 5> forms a triangle as (1, 2), (1, 5), and (2, 5) are edges.
   - <1, 2, 6> forms a triangle as (1, 2), (1, 6), and (2, 6) are edges.
   - <1, 3, 6> forms a triangle as (1, 3), (1, 6), and (3, 6) are edges.
   - <1, 4, 9> forms a triangle as (1, 4), (1, 9), and (4, 9) are edges.
   - <1, 5, 9> forms a triangle as (1, 5), (1, 9), and (5, 9) are edges.
   - <2, 5, 9> forms a triangle as (2, 5), (2, 9), and (5, 9) are edges.
   - <2, 6, 7> does not form a triangle as (2, 7) is not an edge.
   - <2, 6, 9> forms a triangle as (2, 6), (2, 9), and (6, 9) are edges.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **[6]**. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, and <2, 5, 9>.
