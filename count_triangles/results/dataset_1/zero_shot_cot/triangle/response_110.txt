Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Nodes 0, 1, and 2 form a triangle.
2. Nodes 0, 2, and 3 form a triangle.
3. Nodes 0, 4, and 9 form a triangle.
4. Nodes 3, 5, and 7 form a triangle.
5. Nodes 5, 6, and 7 form a triangle.
6. Nodes 0, 8, and 9 form a triangle.
7. Nodes 3, 6, and 8 form a triangle.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
