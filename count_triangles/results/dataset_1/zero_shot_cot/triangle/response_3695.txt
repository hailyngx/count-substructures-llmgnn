Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes. Let's find the triangles step by step:

1. Looking at the edges, we see that there are some possible triangles:
    - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 4)
    - Triangle 2: (0, 1, 6)
    - Triangle 3: (0, 1, 7)
    - Triangle 4: (3, 6, 7)
    - Triangle 5: (4, 1, 6)
    - Triangle 6: (4, 1, 5)
    - Triangle 7: (4, 5, 6)
    - Triangle 8: (6, 3, 7)
    - Triangle 9: (6, 4, 5)
    - Triangle 10: (6, 4, 7)

2. Counting the total number of triangles found: [10]

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
