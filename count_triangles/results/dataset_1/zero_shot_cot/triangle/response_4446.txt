Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Here are all the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 2, 8>
4. <1, 2, 6>
5. <1, 2, 7>
6. <1, 2, 8>
7. <2, 4, 0>
8. <2, 4, 6>
9. <2, 8, 0>
10. <4, 6, 1>
11. <4, 6, 8>
12. <7, 0, 1>
13. <8, 0, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
