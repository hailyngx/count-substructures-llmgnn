Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
7. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
8. Triangle <3, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [8]
