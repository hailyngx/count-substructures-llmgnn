Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's list out the triangles:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>

So, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
