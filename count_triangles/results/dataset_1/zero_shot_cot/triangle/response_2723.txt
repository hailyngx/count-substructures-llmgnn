Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are completely interconnected with each other.

Here are the triangles found in this graph along with the total count:

Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
Triangle 2: <0, 1, 4>
Triangle 3: <0, 3, 6>
Triangle 4: <0, 4, 6>
Triangle 5: <1, 3, 4>
Triangle 6: <4, 5, 6>
Triangle 7: <4, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [7]
