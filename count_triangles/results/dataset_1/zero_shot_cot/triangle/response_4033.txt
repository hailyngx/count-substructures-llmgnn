Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 9>.
