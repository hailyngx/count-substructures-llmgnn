Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in a graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. In this case, we first need to identify all triangles and then count them.

Let's list all the triangles present in this graph:
1. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [2].
