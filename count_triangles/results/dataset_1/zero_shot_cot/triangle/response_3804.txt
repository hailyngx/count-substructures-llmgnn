Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Calculating the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Look for triangles formed by each node:
   
   - Node 0: No triangles.
   
   - Node 1: Triangles formed with node 1: <1, 5, 9>.
   
   - Node 2: No triangles.
   
   - Node 3: No triangles.
   
   - Node 4: No triangles.
   
   - Node 5: No triangles.
   
   - Node 6: No triangles.
   
   - Node 7: No triangles.
   
   - Node 8: No triangles.
   
   - Node 9: No triangles.

2. Total number of triangles: [1]
