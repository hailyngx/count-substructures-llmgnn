Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
