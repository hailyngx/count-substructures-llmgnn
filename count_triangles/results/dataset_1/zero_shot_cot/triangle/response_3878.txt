Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Here are the steps to find the total number of triangles in the graph:

1. Identify all triangles based on the provided edges:
   - Possible triangles:
     - <0, 3, 8>
     - <0, 3, 2>
     - <0, 8, 1>
     - <2, 3, 6>
     - <3, 4, 6>
     - <4, 6, 7>
     - <5, 8, 9>
     - <6, 7, 9>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles found in step 1.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
