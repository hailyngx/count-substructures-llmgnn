Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.

Now, let's write down the triangles found in the graph. Each triangle will be written only once:

- <0, 5, 1>
- <0, 5, 3>
- <0, 6, 3>
- <0, 5, 4>
- <0, 6, 2>
- <0, 6, 3>
- <0, 6, 5>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <5, 3, 4>
- <5, 3, 7>
- <5, 4, 7>
- <6, 2, 3>
- <6, 3, 2>
- <8, 4, 7>
- <8, 4, 9>

Counting the number of unique triangles in the graph, we have found a total of [16] triangles.
