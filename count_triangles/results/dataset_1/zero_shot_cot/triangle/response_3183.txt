Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [8]. The unique triangles found are <0, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>.
