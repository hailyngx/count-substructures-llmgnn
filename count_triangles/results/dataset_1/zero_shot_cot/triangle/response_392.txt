Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
   - Triangle 1: (0, 3, 4)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 4, 6)

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
   - No triangles involving node 1.

3. Node 2 is connected to node 3.
   - No triangles involving node 2.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
   - No additional triangles involving node 3.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 6.
   - No additional triangles involving node 4.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
   - No triangles involving node 5.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
   - No additional triangles involving node 6.

8. Node 7 is connected to node 1.
   - No triangles involving node 7.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
   - No triangles involving node 8.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
    - No additional triangles involving node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2, and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4> and <0, 4, 6>. Hence, the answer is [2].
