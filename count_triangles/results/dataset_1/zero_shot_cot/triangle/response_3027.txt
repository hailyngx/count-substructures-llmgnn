Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can count the number of triangles present. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes connected by edges.

Here are the triangles present in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 6, 5>
3. <0, 9, 3>
4. <0, 8, 5>
5. <3, 6, 5>
6. <3, 7, 4>
7. <3, 9, 8>
8. <6, 5, 8>
9. <6, 3, 9>
10. <8, 5, 6>
11. <8, 9, 0>

There are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
