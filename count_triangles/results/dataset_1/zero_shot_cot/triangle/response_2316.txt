Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

```
       0 ---- 5 ---- 9
       |      |      |
       6      1      |
                     |
       4 ---- 2 ---- 7
             |
             8
```

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can examine each triplet of nodes and check if they form a triangle. However, since the graph is provided with edges, we can just analyze the triangles by looking at the common neighbors of each node pair.

By observing the graph and the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <0, 5, 1>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <0, 5, 2>
5. <0, 5, 7>
6. <0, 5, 3>
7. <0, 5, 8>
8. <0, 5, 4>
9. <5, 1, 6>
10. <5, 1, 9>
11. <5, 1, 2>
12. <5, 1, 7>
13. <5, 1, 3>
14. <5, 1, 8>
15. <5, 1, 4>
16. <1, 9, 6>
17. <1, 9, 2>
18. <1, 9, 7>
19. <1, 9, 3>
20. <1, 9, 8>
21. <1, 9, 4>
22. <9, 6, 2>
23. <9, 6, 7>
24. <9, 6, 3>
25. <9, 6, 8>
26. <9, 6, 4>
27. <6, 2, 7>
28. <6, 2, 3>
29. <6, 2, 8>
30. <6, 2, 4>
31. <2, 7, 3>
32. <2, 7, 8>
33. <2, 7, 4>
34. <7, 3, 8>
35. <7, 3, 4>
36. <3, 8, 4>

Counting the total number of unique triangles in the graph, we find 36 triangles in total. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [36].
