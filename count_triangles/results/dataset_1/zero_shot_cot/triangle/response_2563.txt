Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for groups of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will do this step-by-step:

1. Let's analyze each node to see which triangles can be formed:
   - Node 0: Can form triangles with nodes 3, 6.
   - Node 1: Can form a triangle with node 6.
   - Node 2: No triangles possible.
   - Node 3: Can form triangles with nodes 0, 5, 8.
   - Node 4: Can form triangles with nodes 5, 6, 7.
   - Node 5: Can form triangles with nodes 2, 3, 4, 7.
   - Node 6: Can form triangles with nodes 0, 1, 4, 9.
   - Node 7: Can form triangles with nodes 4, 5, 9.
   - Node 8: Can form a triangle with node 1.
   - Node 9: Can form a triangle with nodes 6, 7.

2. Now, let's list the unique triangles we found:
   - <0, 3, 6>
   - <4, 5, 7>
   - <3, 5, 8>
   - <0, 4, 6>
   - <5, 6, 7>

3. Finally, we count the total number of unique triangles: [5].
