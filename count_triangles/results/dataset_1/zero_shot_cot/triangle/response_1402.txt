Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to consider each possible set of three nodes that form a triangle.

By examining the provided edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <1, 4, 6>
4. <3, 6, 4>
5. <9, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
