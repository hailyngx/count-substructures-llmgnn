Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's break down the process of counting triangles step by step:

1. Look for triangles where each node is connected to every other, for example, <0, 3, 8>.
2. Count the total number of such triangles.

In the given graph, the following triangles can be found:
1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <2, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
