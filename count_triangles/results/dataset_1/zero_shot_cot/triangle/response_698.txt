Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 5>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the graph.
