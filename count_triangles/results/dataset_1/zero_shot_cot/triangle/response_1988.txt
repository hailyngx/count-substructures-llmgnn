Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <4, 5, 2>
5. Triangle <5, 6, 9>
6. Triangle <5, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <6, 7, 9>
8. Triangle <6, 8, 9>
9. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
