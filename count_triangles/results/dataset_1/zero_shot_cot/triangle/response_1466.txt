Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's find the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
9. Node 9 is connected to node 0.

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 1)
- Triangle 2: (2, 1, 5)
- Triangle 3: (2, 8, 5)
- Triangle 4: (4, 1, 5)
- Triangle 5: (4, 3, 2)

Total number of triangles: [5]
