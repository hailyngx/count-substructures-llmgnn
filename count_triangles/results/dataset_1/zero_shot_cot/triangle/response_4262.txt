Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 4 [ <0, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <0, 1, 5>, <6, 7, 9> ].
