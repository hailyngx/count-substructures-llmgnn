Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

Based on the provided edges, the triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 5, 2>
4. <2, 4, 1>
5. <2, 4, 5>
6. <3, 4, 9>
7. <3, 4, 8>
8. <3, 4, 6>
9. <3, 4, 5>
10. <3, 7, 2>
11. <3, 7, 5>
12. <3, 8, 5>
13. <3, 8, 6>
14. <4, 1, 5>
15. <4, 1, 6>
16. <4, 2, 5>
17. <4, 2, 6>
18. <8, 6, 0>
19. <8, 6, 3>

Count of triangles: [19]
