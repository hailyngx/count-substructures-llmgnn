Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify all the triangles formed by the given edges.
2. List the unique triangles that you find.
3. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's start by listing the unique triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 6, 2>
4. <0, 7, 3>
5. <2, 6, 0>
6. <2, 6, 5>
7. <2, 6, 9>
8. <3, 0, 7>
9. <3, 5, 7>
10. <4, 5, 9>
11. <5, 6, 0>
12. <5, 6, 2>
13. <5, 6, 9>
14. <5, 9, 2>
15. <6, 0, 2>
16. <6, 2, 9>
17. <7, 0, 3>
18. <7, 3, 5>
19. <7, 4, 9>
20. <9, 2, 6>
21. <9, 4, 5>
22. <9, 5, 7>
23. <9, 7, 4>

Now, count the total number of unique triangles: [23]

So, there are 23 triangles in the given graph.
