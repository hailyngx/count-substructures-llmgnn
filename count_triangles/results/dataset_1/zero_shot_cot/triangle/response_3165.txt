Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected. We will go through the nodes and check for triangles formed by each set of three nodes.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. (0, 3, 7)
2. (1, 4, 5)
3. (1, 2, 9)
4. (2, 4, 5)
5. (2, 5, 9)
6. (2, 6, 8)
7. (3, 4, 5)
8. (3, 6, 7)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, and <3, 6, 7>.
