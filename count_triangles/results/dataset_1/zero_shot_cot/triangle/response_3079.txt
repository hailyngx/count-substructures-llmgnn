Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 5>

Now, let's determine the total number of triangles in the graph:
