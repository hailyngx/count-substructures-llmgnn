Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We can count the number of triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to each other in a way that forms a triangle. Let's start counting the triangles:

1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 1, and 8
2. Triangle involving nodes 1, 4, and 6
3. Triangle involving nodes 3, 7, and 8

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, and <3, 7, 8>.
