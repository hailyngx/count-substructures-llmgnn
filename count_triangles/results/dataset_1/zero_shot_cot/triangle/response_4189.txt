Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges provided. 

Let's list the triangles step by step, starting with node 0:
1. Triangle with node 0: <0, 2, 3>
2. Continuing from node 2: <2, 6, 8>
3. Moving to node 3: No new triangles with node 3.
4. Moving to node 6: <6, 1, 8>
5. Moving to node 1: No new triangles with node 1.
6. Moving to node 8: No new triangles with node 8.
7. Moving to node 1: No new triangles with node 1.
8. Moving to node 5: <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
