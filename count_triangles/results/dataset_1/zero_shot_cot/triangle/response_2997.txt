Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <4, 6, 9>
3. <2, 1, 4>
4. <5, 6, 8>

So, there are [4] triangles in this graph.
