Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the triangles in the graph by finding all possible combinations of nodes that form triangles. 

The possible triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <0, 6, 4>
5. <0, 6, 9>
6. <1, 0, 2>
7. <2, 7, 6>
8. <3, 4, 6>
9. <3, 8, 6>
10. <3, 8, 9>
11. <4, 6, 7>
12. <6, 7, 9>
13. <6, 8, 9>
14. <7, 9, 6>
15. <8, 3, 6>

There are 15 unique triangles in total, so the number of triangles in the graph is [15].
