Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by finding nodes that form a complete subgraph of 3 nodes connected by edges.

The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <3, 5, 6>
4. <3, 7, 9>
5. <3, 8, 9>
6. <5, 6, 3>
7. <7, 0, 8>
8. <7, 8, 9>
9. <8, 3, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph: [9].
