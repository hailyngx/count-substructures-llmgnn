Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, and <4, 5, 6>.  
So, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
