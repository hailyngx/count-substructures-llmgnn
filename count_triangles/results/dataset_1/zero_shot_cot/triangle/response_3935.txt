Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique combinations of 3 nodes that are interconnected. Let's analyze the graph step by step.

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 8.
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 6 and 8.
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 1 and 5.
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 4 and 7.
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 1 and 2.
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 5 and 9.
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph:
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 8, 2>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 6, 2>
- <3, 0, 1>
- <8, 0, 1>
- <9, 3, 0>
- <9, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
