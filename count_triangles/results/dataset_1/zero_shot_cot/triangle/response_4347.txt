Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step in counting the triangles:

1. Identify the nodes connected directly by an edge:
   - Node 0 is connected to Node 7
   - Node 1 is connected to Node 5 and Node 7
   - Node 2 is connected to Node 3, Node 4, and Node 9
   - Node 3 is connected to Node 2, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8
   - Node 4 is connected to Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8
   - Node 5 is connected to Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 8
   - Node 6 is connected to Node 4 and Node 8
   - Node 7 is connected to Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, and Node 4
   - Node 8 is connected to Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 6
   - Node 9 is connected to Node 2

2. Look for triangles formed by these connections:
   - The triangles in this graph are: <2, 4, 8> and <3, 4, 5>.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [2].
