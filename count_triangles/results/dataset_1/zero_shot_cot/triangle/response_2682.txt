Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 has neighbors 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.
2. Node 1 has neighbors 0, 6, 8.
3. Node 2 has neighbors 0.
4. Node 3 has neighbors 0, 4, 5, 7, 8.
5. Node 4 has neighbors 3, 5, 6, 8.
6. Node 5 has neighbors 0, 3, 4.
7. Node 6 has neighbors 0, 1, 4, 8.
8. Node 7 has neighbors 0, 3.
9. Node 8 has neighbors 1, 3, 4, 6.

Now, let's list the triangles (cycles of length 3) present in the graph:

- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 5, 4>
- <3, 5, 0> 

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in total. So, the output is: [7].
