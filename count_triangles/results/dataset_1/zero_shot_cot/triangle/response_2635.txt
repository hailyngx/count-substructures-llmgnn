Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - <0, 8, 9>

2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - <1, 4, 9>
   - <1, 7, 8>

3. Triangles involving node 3:
   - No triangles

4. Triangles involving node 4:
   - No new triangles
   
5. Triangles involving node 5:
   - No triangles

6. Triangles involving node 6:
   - No triangles

7. Triangles involving node 7:
   - No new triangles

8. Triangles involving node 8:
   - No new triangles

9. Triangles involving node 9:
   - No new triangles

From the above analysis, we have found 3 unique triangles. So, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
