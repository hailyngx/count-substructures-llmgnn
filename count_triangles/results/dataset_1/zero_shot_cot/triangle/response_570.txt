Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. 

A triangle can be formed if there are three nodes connected to each other. Let's look for all the possible triangles in the graph:

1. Possible triangle involving node 0: 
   - (0, 2), (2, 5), (0, 5)

2. Possible triangle involving node 2: 
   - (2, 0), (0, 5), (2, 5)
   - (2, 7), (7, 8), (2, 8)
   - (2, 7), (7, 8), (2, 9)

3. Possible triangle involving node 5: 
   - (5, 0), (0, 2), (2, 5)

4. Possible triangle involving node 7: 
   - (7, 2), (2, 8), (7, 8)

5. Possible triangle involving node 8: 
   - (8, 2), (2, 7), (8, 7)
   - (8, 3), (3, 4), (4, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 5>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <0, 2, 5>, and <3, 4, 8>.
