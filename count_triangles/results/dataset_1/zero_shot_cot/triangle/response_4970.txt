Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the possible triangles by checking the connections between the nodes based on the provided edges. 

Let's start by listing the possible triangles:
1. (0, 1, 4)
2. (0, 1, 6)
3. (0, 1, 9)
4. (0, 5, 9)
5. (0, 8, 9)
6. (1, 4, 6)
7. (1, 4, 9)
8. (1, 6, 9)
9. (2, 4, 6)
10. (2, 4, 9)
11. (2, 6, 9)
12. (4, 6, 9)

Counting the total number of triangles, we find that there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
