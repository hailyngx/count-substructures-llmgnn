Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Counting the number of triangles in a graph can be done by examining each set of three nodes and checking if there are edges connecting all three nodes.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Calculate all possible triangles involving node 0:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 4) = <0, 1, 4>
   - Triangle 2: (0, 1), (0, 7), (1, 7) = <0, 1, 7>
   - Triangle 3: (0, 3), (0, 4), (3, 4) = <0, 3, 4>
   - Total triangles for node 0: 3

2. Calculate all possible triangles involving node 1:
   - Triangle 1: (1, 0), (1, 4), (0, 4) = <1, 0, 4>
   - Total triangles for node 1: 1

3. Calculate all possible triangles involving node 3:
   - Triangle 1: (3, 0), (3, 4), (0, 4) = <3, 0, 4>
   - Total triangles for node 3: 1

4. Calculate all possible triangles involving node 4:
   - Triangle 1: (4, 0), (4, 1), (0, 1) = <4, 0, 1>
   - Total triangles for node 4: 1

5. Calculate all possible triangles involving node 7:
   - Triangle 1: (7, 0), (7, 4), (0, 4) = <7, 0, 4>
   - Total triangles for node 7: 1

6. Calculate all possible triangles involving node 8:
   - No triangles involving node 8.

Adding up all the triangles we found: 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = [7]

Therefore, there are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph.
