Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can identify all possible triangles by checking all sets of three nodes that are connected by edges.

Let's list down the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <1, 7, 8>
2. <2, 3, 9>
3. <4, 6, 9>
4. <6, 7, 8>
5. <6, 8, 9>
6. <7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the provided graph.
