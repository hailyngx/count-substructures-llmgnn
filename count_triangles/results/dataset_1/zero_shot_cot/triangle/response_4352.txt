Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 3.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 5.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles by checking for each possible triangle combination:

1. Triangle 0-1-6: This triangle exists.
2. Triangle 0-1-7: This triangle does not exist.
3. Triangle 0-1-9: This triangle does not exist.
4. Triangle 0-6-7: This triangle does not exist.
5. Triangle 0-6-9: This triangle exists.
6. Triangle 1-6-7: This triangle does not exist.
7. Triangle 1-6-9: This triangle does not exist.
8. Triangle 6-7-9: This triangle does not exist.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6> and <0, 6, 9>.
