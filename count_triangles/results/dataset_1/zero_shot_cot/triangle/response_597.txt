Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to find all possible combinations of three nodes forming triangles. 

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<7, 9, 2>
<9, 2, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
