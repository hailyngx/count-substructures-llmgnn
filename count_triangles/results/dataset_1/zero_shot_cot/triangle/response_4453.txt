Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to each other:
   - Node 0: 0, 9
   - Node 1: 1, 2, 3, 4
   - Node 2: 1, 2, 4, 6
   - Node 3: 1, 3, 6, 7
   - Node 4: 1, 2, 4, 7
   - Node 5: 5, 7, 8
   - Node 6: 2, 3, 6, 8
   - Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
   - Node 8: 5, 6, 8, 9
   - Node 9: 0, 7, 8

2. Triangles found:
   - <1, 2, 4>
   - <3, 6, 7>
   - <5, 7, 8>
   - <7, 8, 9>

There are 4 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
