Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {3, 7}
2. Nodes connected to node 1: {9}
3. Nodes connected to node 2: {3, 8, 9}
4. Nodes connected to node 3: {0, 2, 5, 7}
5. Nodes connected to node 4: {8}
6. Nodes connected to node 5: {3, 7}
7. Nodes connected to node 7: {0, 3, 5}
8. Nodes connected to node 8: {2, 4}
9. Nodes connected to node 9: {1, 2}

Now, let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <2, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
