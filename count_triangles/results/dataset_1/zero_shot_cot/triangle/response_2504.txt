Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all adjacent to each other. Let's first list out all the triangles we can find in this graph:

1. <2, 3, 5>
2. <3, 5, 7>
3. <3, 7, 9>
4. <5, 7, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles by putting them in brackets:

Total number of triangles: [4]
