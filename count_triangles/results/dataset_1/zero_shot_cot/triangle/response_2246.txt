Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. 

Let's list the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 5, 9>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <2, 7, 8>
4. <2, 7, 4>
5. <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
