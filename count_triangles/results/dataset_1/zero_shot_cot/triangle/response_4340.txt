Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are completely connected to each other. We can identify each triangle by looking for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two.

The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, 5, 1>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <1, 4, 3>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 4, 7>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph: [5]
