Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify these triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 2, 6.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 2, 9.
3. Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 0, 1, 5.
4. Node 3 forms no triangle.
5. Node 4 forms no triangle.
6. Node 5 forms no triangle.
7. Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 0, 7, 9.
8. Node 7 forms no triangle.
9. Node 8 forms no triangle.
10. Node 9 forms triangles with nodes 1, 3, 5, 6.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <6, 0, 7>, <6, 0, 9>, and <1, 9, 5>.
