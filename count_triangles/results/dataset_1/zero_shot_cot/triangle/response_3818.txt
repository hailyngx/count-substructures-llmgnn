Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Number of triangles:  <2, 3, 8>, <2, 7, 3>, <3, 7, 4>. 

Total number of triangles: [3]
