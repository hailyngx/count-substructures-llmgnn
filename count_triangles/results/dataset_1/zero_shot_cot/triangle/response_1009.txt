Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected with each other.

By observing the edges given in the graph, we can form the following triangles:
1. <1, 5, 4>
2. <1, 5, 8>
3. <1, 7, 4>
4. <1, 7, 8>
5. <3, 0, 9>
6. <7, 4, 5>
7. <7, 4, 8>
8. <7, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
