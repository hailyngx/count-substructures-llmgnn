Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are pairwise connected.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
