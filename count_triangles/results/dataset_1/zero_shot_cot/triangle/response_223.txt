Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We'll go step by step to identify them.

1. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 4: <0, 1, 4>.
2. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 9: <0, 4, 9>.
3. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 8: <0, 1, 8>.
4. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 5: <4, 8, 5>.
5. Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 3: <2, 5, 3>.
6. Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 9: <5, 3, 9>.
7. Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 8: <5, 7, 8>.
8. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 9: <6, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
