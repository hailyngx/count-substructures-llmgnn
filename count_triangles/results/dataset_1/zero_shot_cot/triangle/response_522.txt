Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 5>
4. Triangle <0, 8, 7>
5. Triangle <2, 0, 4>
6. Triangle <4, 0, 8>
7. Triangle <6, 0, 5>
8. Triangle <8, 0, 7>

There are 8 triangles in total, so the output is:

[8]
