Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. Let's list the unique triangles first and then count how many triangles exist in total.

Unique Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 4, 2>
4. <0, 4, 3>
5. <1, 6, 5>
6. <3, 4, 5>
7. <5, 6, 9>
8. <5, 6, 7>
9. <5, 6, 1>

Total Number of Triangles: [9]
