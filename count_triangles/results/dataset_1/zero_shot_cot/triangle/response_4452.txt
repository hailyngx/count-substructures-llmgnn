Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Calculating manually, we can see the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <2, 3, 7>
3. <2, 4, 5>
4. <2, 7, 8>
5. <3, 4, 5>
6. <4, 6, 9>
7. <7, 8, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
