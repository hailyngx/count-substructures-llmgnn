Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the triangles in this graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles I found:
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
