Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are <0, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <5, 6, 9>.
