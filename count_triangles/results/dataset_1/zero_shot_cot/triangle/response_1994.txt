Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can determine the total number of triangles by identifying all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the triangles step by step:

1. Triangles involving Node 0:
    - <0, 1, 4>
    - <0, 4, 5>
    - <0, 4, 7>

2. Triangles involving Node 1:
    - <1, 0, 4>
    - <1, 4, 6>

3. Triangles involving Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

4. Triangles involving Node 4:
    - <4, 0, 1>
    - <4, 0, 3>
    - <4, 1, 6>
    - <4, 6, 8>
    - <4, 6, 9>
    - <4, 8, 9>

5. Triangles involving Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

6. Triangles involving Node 6:
    No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6.

7. Triangles involving Node 7:
    - <7, 0, 5>
    - <7, 0, 3>
    - <7, 5, 9>

8. Triangles involving Node 8:
    No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8.

9. Triangles involving Node 9:
    No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 10, and they are:
[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <4, 0, 3>, <4, 1, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <7, 0, 5>, <7, 0, 3>, <7, 5, 9>]
