Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Triangles in a graph can be represented by three nodes forming a closed loop.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
1. <0, 4, 2>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 9, 1>
4. <2, 3, 8>
5. <2, 4, 5>
6. <5, 1, 6>
7. <5, 2, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
