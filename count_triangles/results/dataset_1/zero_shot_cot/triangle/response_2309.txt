Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow a step-by-step approach:

1. Identify all triangles in the graph by selecting every combination of three nodes that are connected with each other.
2. Count the number of unique triangles found.

Let's identify the triangles:
- Triangles involving node 0: None
- Triangles involving node 1: None
- Triangles involving node 2: None
- Triangles involving node 3: (0, 3, 4), (3, 4, 7)
- Triangles involving node 4: None
- Triangles involving node 5: None
- Triangles involving node 6: None
- Triangles involving node 7: None
- Triangles involving node 8: None
- Triangles involving node 9: None

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = [2] 

The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 4>
