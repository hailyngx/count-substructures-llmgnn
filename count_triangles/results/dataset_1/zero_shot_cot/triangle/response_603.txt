Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles step by step:

1. We will identify all triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected in such a way that they form triangles.

2. We will list down the triangles to ensure we count each unique triangle only once.

3. Finally, we will output the total count of triangles in the graph.

Let's start by listing down the identified triangles:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 6, 5>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <1, 3, 4>
5. <1, 8, 6>
6. <2, 4, 9>
7. <3, 4, 5>
8. <4, 5, 6>
9. <6, 7, 9>
10. <6, 8, 9>

Now, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
