Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8)
