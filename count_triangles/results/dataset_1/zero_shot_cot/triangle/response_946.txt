Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Identify all the triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.
2. Exclude any triangles that share an edge with another triangle to avoid double counting.

Let's go step-by-step:

Firstly, let's list all the triangles:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 5, 3>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <7, 9, 8>

Now, count the total number of triangles:
- Total number of triangles: [7]
