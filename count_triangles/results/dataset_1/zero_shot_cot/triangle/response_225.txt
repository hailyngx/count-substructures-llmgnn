Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By examining the given list of edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <5, 4, 9>
2. Triangle <8, 2, 1>
3. Triangle <8, 1, 6>
4. Triangle <8, 9, 5>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in total in the given graph.
