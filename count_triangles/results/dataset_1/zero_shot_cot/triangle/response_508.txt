Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 2>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 4>, <6, 7, 1>, <8, 0, 5>, <8, 5, 6>.
