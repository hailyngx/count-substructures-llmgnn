Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that form a triangle by having edges between all three of them.

After analyzing the given graph, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <0, 7, 8>
3. <0, 8, 6>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <2, 4, 6>
6. <2, 6, 8>
7. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
