Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each possible set of three nodes and see if there are edges connecting all three nodes. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 8, 2>
4. <0, 8, 9>
5. <1, 3, 7>
6. <1, 4, 5>
7. <1, 5, 7>
8. <2, 3, 4>
9. <2, 4, 8>
10. <3, 6, 9>
11. <4, 5, 9>
12. <5, 7, 9>
13. <6, 7, 9>

So, there are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
