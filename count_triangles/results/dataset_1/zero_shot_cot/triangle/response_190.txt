Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <2, 3, 4>
4. <2, 5, 7>
5. <2, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
