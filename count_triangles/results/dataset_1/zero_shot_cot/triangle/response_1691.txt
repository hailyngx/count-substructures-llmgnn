Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down all possible triangles by checking every set of three nodes:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 0>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 0, 4>
5. Triangle <2, 0, 5>
6. Triangle <4, 0, 1>
7. Triangle <4, 0, 2>
8. Triangle <5, 2, 6>
9. Triangle <6, 5, 7>
10. Triangle <7, 1, 4>
11. Triangle <7, 1, 6>
12. Triangle <7, 1, 9>
13. Triangle <7, 4, 0>
14. Triangle <7, 4, 1>
15. Triangle <7, 6, 5>
16. Triangle <9, 7, 1>

There are a total of [16] triangles in the given graph.
