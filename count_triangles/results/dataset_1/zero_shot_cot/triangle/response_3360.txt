Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List out all triangles in the graph.
In order to find triangles, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list out the triangles:

1. <2, 4, 7>
2. <2, 4, 8>
3. <2, 4, 9>
4. <2, 5, 3>
5. <2, 5, 7>
6. <2, 5, 9>
7. <4, 7, 8>
8. <4, 7, 2>
9. <4, 8, 3>
10. <4, 8, 7>
11. <4, 8, 9>
12. <5, 3, 1>
13. <5, 3, 6>
14. <5, 3, 2>
15. <5, 6, 0>
16. <5, 6, 1>
17. <5, 6, 2>
18. <3, 8, 4>
19. <3, 8, 7>
20. <3, 8, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.
By adding up the count of unique triangles found, the total number of triangles is 20.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
