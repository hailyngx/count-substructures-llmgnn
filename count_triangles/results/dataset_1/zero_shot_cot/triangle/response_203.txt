Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by the edges. We can do this by looking for nodes that have connections to each other, resulting in triangles.

Let's list the unique triangles one by one:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <2, 3, 8>
4. <4, 5, 8>
5. <4, 7, 8>
6. <5, 6, 7>
7. <5, 7, 8>

So, there are 7 unique triangles in total. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
