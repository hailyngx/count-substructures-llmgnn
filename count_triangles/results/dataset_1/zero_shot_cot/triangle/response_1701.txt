Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we'll first identify all the triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

Let's list the triangles as we find them:

1. <0, 6, 7>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <2, 3, 6>
4. <3, 4, 7>
5. <3, 5, 6>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles inside brackets:
