Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each vertex
```
Degree of Node 0: 2
Degree of Node 1: 2
Degree of Node 2: 2
Degree of Node 3: 4
Degree of Node 4: 4
Degree of Node 5: 1
Degree of Node 6: 1
Degree of Node 7: 2
Degree of Node 8: 2
Degree of Node 9: 2
```

Step 2: Determine the number of triangles in the graph
- To form a triangle, we need three vertices connected by three edges.
- Let's consider each node and see if there are triangles involving that node.

Triangles involving Node 0 = 0
Triangles involving Node 1 = 0
Triangles involving Node 2 = 0
Triangles involving Node 3 = 2 (Triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <3, 4, 6>)
Triangles involving Node 4 = 3 (Triangles: <1, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <4, 7, 9>)
Triangles involving Node 5 = 0
Triangles involving Node 6 = 0
Triangles involving Node 7 = 0
Triangles involving Node 8 = 0
Triangles involving Node 9 = 0

Total number of triangles in the graph: [5]
Unique triangles: <<0, 2, 3>, <3, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <4, 7, 9>>
