Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles present in the graph based on the edges provided. 

Here are the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <1, 5, 8>
4. <2, 4, 6>
5. <3, 5, 6>
6. <4, 5, 6>
7. <4, 8, 9>
8. <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
