Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's identify all possible triangles formed by the edges. 

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <0, 6, 3>
5. <2, 8, 9>
6. <2, 9, 6>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
