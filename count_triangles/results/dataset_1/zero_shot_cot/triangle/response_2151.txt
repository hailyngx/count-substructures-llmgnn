Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Let's list down the triangles we can find in this graph:

1. <0, 6, 9>
2. <1, 4, 6>
3. <1, 4, 9>
4. <1, 6, 9>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <2, 8, 9>
7. <3, 4, 9>
8. <4, 6, 8>
9. <4, 8, 9>
10. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
