Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After analyzing the given graph, we can find the following triangles:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 2, 3>
4. <0, 2, 7>
5. <0, 3, 4>
6. <0, 3, 7>
7. <2, 3, 4>
8. <2, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
