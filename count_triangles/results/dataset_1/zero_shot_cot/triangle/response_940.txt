Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected. Here are the steps to find the number of triangles:

Step 1: Identify the triangles in the graph
- Based on the given edge list, we can identify the triangles:
  - <0, 2, 4>
  - <0, 2, 8>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles
- There are 2 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
