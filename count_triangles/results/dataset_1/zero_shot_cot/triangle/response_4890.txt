Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a triangle. Here are the unique triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 5, 7>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
