Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected with each other. Let's look at each possible triangle:

1. <1, 4, 7>
2. <1, 5, 6>
3. <2, 3, 5>
4. <2, 3, 8>
5. <3, 4, 7>
6. <3, 5, 8>
7. <4, 7, 8>
8. <6, 7, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
