Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges. Let's do this step by step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: 1, 9
2. Nodes connected to node 1: 0
3. Nodes connected to node 3: 8, 9
4. Nodes connected to node 4: 9
5. Nodes connected to node 5: 8, 9
6. Nodes connected to node 6: 7
7. Nodes connected to node 7: 6, 8
8. Nodes connected to node 8: 3, 5, 7
9. Nodes connected to node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's find the triangles present in the graph:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <3, 8, 9>
- <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
