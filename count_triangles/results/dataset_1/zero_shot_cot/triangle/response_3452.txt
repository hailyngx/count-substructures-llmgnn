Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by connected nodes.

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 4>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 5, 0>
6. Triangle <2, 9, 4>
7. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
8. Triangle <4, 9, 2>
9. Triangle <4, 8, 1>
10. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

There are 10 total triangles in the given graph. Thus, the answer is [10].
