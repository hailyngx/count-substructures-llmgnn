Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized with the following edges:

```
0 --- 1       5
 \   /       / \
  \ /       /   \
   2       2-----8
            |   / |
            |  /  |
            | /   |
            4 --- 6
             \   /
              \ /
               7
               |
               3
               |
               9
```

Let's count the number of triangles in this graph.
