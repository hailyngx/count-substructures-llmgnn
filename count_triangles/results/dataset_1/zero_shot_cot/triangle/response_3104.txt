Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each instance of a triangle, which is a set of three nodes connected by edges to form a closed loop.

The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
1. <0, 4, 1>
2. <0, 5, 1>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <0, 5, 2>
5. <0, 5, 7>
6. <0, 9, 3>
7. <1, 5, 2>
8. <2, 3, 7>
9. <2, 3, 8>
10. <2, 7, 5>
11. <2, 8, 4>
12. <3, 7, 5>
13. <3, 8, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
