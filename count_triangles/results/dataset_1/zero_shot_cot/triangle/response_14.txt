Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a table to represent the adjacency matrix of the given graph:

```
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
1   0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
2   1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
3   0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
4   0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
5   0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
6   0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
7   0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
8   1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
9   0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
```

Next, let's count the number of triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when there are three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can count the triangles by checking each possible combination of three connected nodes.

After analyzing the graph, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 3, and they are as follows:
<2, 3, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
