Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles present in the given graph.
The triangles are:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <1, 6, 8>
5. <1, 7, 8>
6. <2, 0, 4>
7. <3, 6, 7>
8. <3, 6, 8>
9. <3, 7, 8>

Now, let's count the number of triangles in total.
