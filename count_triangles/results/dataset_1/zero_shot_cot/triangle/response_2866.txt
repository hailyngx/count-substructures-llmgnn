Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph using the adjacency matrix:

\[
\begin{array}{cccccccccc}
0 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
5 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
6 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
7 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
3 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
4 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
9 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

Next, to find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for cycles of length 3, i.e., triangles formed by 3 nodes connected to each other.

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 6, 4>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <5, 4, 7>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <9, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [8].
