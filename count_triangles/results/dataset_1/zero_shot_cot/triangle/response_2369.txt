Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 4 and 6
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 7
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, 8, and 9
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 4 and 5
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6
10. Node 9: Connected to node 5

Now, let's identify the unique triangles:

1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <2, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
