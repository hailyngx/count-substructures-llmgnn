Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by connecting nodes through edges.

Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - No triangles involving node 0.

2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - No triangles involving node 1.

3. Triangles involving node 2:
   - No triangles involving node 2.

4. Triangles involving node 3:
   - No triangles involving node 3.

5. Triangles involving node 4:
   - Triangle <2, 4, 5>

6. Triangles involving node 5:
   - Triangle <1, 5, 6>
   - Triangle <4, 5, 6>

7. Triangles involving node 6:
   - No additional triangles involving node 6.

8. Triangles involving node 8:
   - No triangles involving node 8.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <2, 4, 5> and <1, 5, 6>.
