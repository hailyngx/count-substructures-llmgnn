Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will list the triangles found and then count the total number of unique triangles. 

Triangles in the given graph:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <1, 5, 6>
5. <1, 5, 9>
6. <1, 6, 8>
7. <5, 6, 8>
8. <5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
