Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {1, 3}
2. Nodes connected to node 1: {0, 4, 5, 8}
3. Nodes connected to node 2: {4}
4. Nodes connected to node 3: {0, 7}
5. Nodes connected to node 4: {1, 2}
6. Nodes connected to node 5: {1, 6, 8}
7. Nodes connected to node 6: {5, 7}
8. Nodes connected to node 7: {3, 6, 9}
9. Nodes connected to node 8: {1, 5}
10. Nodes connected to node 9: {7}

Now, let's list the unique triangles we have found:

1. Triangle involving nodes <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle involving nodes <1, 4, 5>
3. Triangle involving nodes <5, 6, 8>
4. Triangle involving nodes <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
