Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each possible triangle formed by the connected nodes.

The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}.

Let's find the triangles:
1. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 0, 3>
4. Triangle <2, 0, 4>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 4>
6. Triangle <1, 8, 9>
7. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
8. Triangle <5, 6, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
