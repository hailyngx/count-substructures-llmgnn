Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's list all possible triangles using the given edges:
1. (0, 3, 7)
2. (0, 4, 7)
3. (0, 6, 1)
4. (0, 6, 9)
5. (1, 6, 9)
6. (2, 5, 8)

Now, let's count the number of triangles:
There are a total of [0] triangles in the given graph.
