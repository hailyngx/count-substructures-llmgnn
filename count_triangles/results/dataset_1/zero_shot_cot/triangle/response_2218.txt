Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
1. Let's identify the triangles present in the given graph:
- Triangle 1: Nodes {1, 5, 9}
- Triangle 2: Nodes {3, 7, 8}
- Triangle 3: Nodes {7, 4, 2}
- Triangle 4: Nodes {2, 9, 1}
- Triangle 5: Nodes {1, 7, 3}

2. The total number of triangles is [5].
