Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that form closed loops (triangles).

From the given edges:
1. Node 0 is connected to Node 4, forming a potential triangle with Node 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to Node 3, Node 9, and Node 3 is connected to Node 9, forming a potential triangle with Nodes 1 and 9.
3. Node 3-1-9 form a triangle.
4. Node 4 is connected to Node 0, forming a potential triangle with Node 0.
5. Node 6 is connected to Node 8 and 9, and Node 8 is connected to Node 9. Nodes 6-8-9 form a triangle.
6. Node 7 is connected to Node 9, forming a potential triangle with Node 9.
7. Nodes 6 and 9 are connected to each other, forming a potential triangle with Node 6.
8. Node 8 is connected to Node 5 and 6, and Nodes 5-8-6 form a triangle.
9. There are no more triangles in the graph.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph:
<1, 3, 9>
<5, 8, 6>
<6, 8, 9>
