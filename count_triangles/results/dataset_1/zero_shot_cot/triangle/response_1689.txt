Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [10]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 9>.
