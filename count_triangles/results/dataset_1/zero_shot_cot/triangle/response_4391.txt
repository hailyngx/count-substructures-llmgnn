Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's count the triangles step-by-step:
1. Starting with node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 9.
   - Among these connections, we have triangles: <0, 3, 5> and <0, 4, 5>.

2. Moving to node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
   - No triangles are formed with node 1.

3. Next, node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9.
   - Among these connections, we have triangles: <2, 3, 5> and <2, 5, 9>.

4. Moving on to node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6.
   - Among these connections, we have triangles: <0, 3, 5> and <2, 3, 5> (already counted).

5. Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7.
   - Among these connections, we have a triangle <0, 4, 5> (already counted).

6. Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
   - Among these connections, we have triangles: <0, 3, 5> and <0, 4, 5> (already counted).

7. Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
   - No triangles are formed with node 6.

8. Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
   - No triangles are formed with node 7.

9. Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
   - No triangles are formed with node 8.

10. Finally, node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
    - No triangles are formed with node 9.

Total number of unique triangles: [2]. [1, 3, 5] and [2, 3, 5].
