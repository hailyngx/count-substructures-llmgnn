Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected with each other (form a triangle). Here is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
