Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by finding the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 5, 3>
4. <3, 4, 8>
5. <6, 7, 9>

There are 5 triangles in total. Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
