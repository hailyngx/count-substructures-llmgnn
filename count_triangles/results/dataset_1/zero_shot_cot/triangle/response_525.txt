Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for the triangles formed by the nodes connected with edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other in the graph. Let's go step by step to find the triangles:

1. Check each connected triple of nodes:
   - (0, 4, 6)
   - (0, 4, 7)
   - (0, 4, 9)
   - (0, 5, 7)
   - (1, 3, 6)
   - (1, 6, 7)
   - (4, 6, 7)
   - (6, 7, 8)

2. Count the total number of unique triangles found:
   - Total number of unique triangles = 4

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, and <0, 5, 7>.
