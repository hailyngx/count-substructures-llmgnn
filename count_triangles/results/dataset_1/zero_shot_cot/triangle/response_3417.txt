Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

Looking at the list of edges, we can see that there are a total of 10 nodes and 20 edges. One approach is to find the triangles by checking each possible triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle. However, we can follow a more systematic approach to find the triangles by looking at common neighbors of nodes in the graph.

Given the edges, we can identify common neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 6 and 9.
- Node 1: Neighbor is 2.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 5 and 9.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 4 and 7.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0 and 9.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 8: Neighbor is 7.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4, and 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles in this graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle 2: <0, 9, 6>
- Triangle 3: <0, 9, 2>
- Triangle 4: <5, 4, 7>
- Triangle 5: <2, 7, 5>
- Triangle 6: <2, 7, 8>
- Triangle 7: <9, 4, 5>
- Triangle 8: <9, 5, 4>
- Triangle 9: <7, 2, 9>
- Triangle 10: <7, 9, 2>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [10].
