Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <1, 3, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
4. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <3, 8, 9>

So there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
