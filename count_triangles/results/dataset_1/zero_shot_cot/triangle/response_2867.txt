Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the given graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 6), (2, 0), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 3), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Next, we can count the total number of triangles by finding all unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected. Let's list the triangles:

1. <3, 7, 9>
2. <7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
