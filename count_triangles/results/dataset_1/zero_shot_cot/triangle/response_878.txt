Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].  

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
