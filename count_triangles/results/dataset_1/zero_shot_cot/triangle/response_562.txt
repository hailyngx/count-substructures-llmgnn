Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 6>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 1, 7>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 3, 5>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 6, 1>
   - Triangle 5: <1, 6, 0>
   - Triangle 6: <1, 6, 8>
   - Triangle 7: <1, 7, 4>
   - Triangle 8: <3, 5, 9>
   - Triangle 9: <6, 1, 0>
   - Triangle 10: <8, 6, 1>
   - Triangle 11: <8, 6, 0>

2. Let's check if there are any additional triangles:
   - After checking all possible combinations, we find no additional unique triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11] as listed above in <>.
