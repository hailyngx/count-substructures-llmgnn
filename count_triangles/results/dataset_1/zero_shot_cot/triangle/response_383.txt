Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we will need to identify all unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes that are all pairwise connected. 

By examining the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <1, 2, 8>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <1, 6, 9>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
