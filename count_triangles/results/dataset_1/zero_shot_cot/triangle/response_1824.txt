Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the triangles in the given graph by checking each set of three nodes which are all connected to each other.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [5]
