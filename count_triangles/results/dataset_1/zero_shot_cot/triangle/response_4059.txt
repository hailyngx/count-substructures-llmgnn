Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will consider each possible triangle by examining each combination of three nodes.

Let's go step by step to identify the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to Node 0: {4, 5, 7}
    - Triangle <0, 4, 5>
    - Triangle <0, 5, 7>

2. Nodes connected to Node 2: {5, 6, 8}
    - Triangle <2, 5, 8>
    - Triangle <2, 6, 8>

3. Nodes connected to Node 3: {6}
    (No triangles can be formed with only Node 3)

4. Nodes connected to Node 4: {0}
    (No triangles can be formed with only Node 4)

5. Nodes connected to Node 5: {0, 2, 8}
    - Triangle <0, 2, 5>
    - Triangle <0, 5, 8>

6. Nodes connected to Node 6: {2, 3, 8}
    (No additional triangles)

7. Nodes connected to Node 7: {0, 8, 9}
    (No triangles can be formed with only Node 7)

8. Nodes connected to Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 7}
    - Triangle <2, 6, 8>
    - Triangle <5, 6, 8>
    - Triangle <5, 7, 8>

9. Nodes connected to Node 9: {7}
    (No triangles can be formed with only Node 9)

Given the identified triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
