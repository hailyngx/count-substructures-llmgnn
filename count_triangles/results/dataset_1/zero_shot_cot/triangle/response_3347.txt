Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle by having edges connecting all three nodes. 
Here are the triangles found in the graph:
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <2, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
