Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. In simple terms, we need to find all triangles in the graph. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle 3: <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle 4: <1, 6, 2>
- Triangle 5: <1, 6, 3>
- Triangle 6: <2, 6, 3>
- Triangle 7: <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
