Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles by checking each triplet of nodes.
- Possible triangles: (0, 1, 5), (2, 3, 5), (2, 3, 7), (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 8)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.
- Number of triangles: 5

So, the answer is:
