Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's list all the triangles that we can find in the given graph:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [7]
