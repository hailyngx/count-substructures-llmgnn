Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Nodes 3, 4, and 5 form a triangle.
2. Nodes 3, 5, and 7 form a triangle.
3. Nodes 4, 5, and 6 form a triangle.
4. Nodes 4, 6, and 9 form a triangle.
5. Nodes 5, 6, and 9 form a triangle.
6. Nodes 5, 7, and 8 form a triangle.
7. Nodes 7, 8, and 9 form a triangle.

Therefore, there are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
