Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
6. Node 7 is connected to node 5.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
8. Node 9 is connected to node 8.

Let's now list the triangles:
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 5, 3>
<3, 4, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
