Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
6. Triangle <3, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
