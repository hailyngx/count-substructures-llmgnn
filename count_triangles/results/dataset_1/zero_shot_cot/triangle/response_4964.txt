Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <5, 6, 8>

Thus, there are 2 triangles in total in this graph. 

The total number of triangles is [2].
