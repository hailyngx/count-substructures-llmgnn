Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's consider each possible triangle:

1. Triangle with nodes 0, 6, and 7: <0, 6, 7>
2. Triangle with nodes 0, 6, and 8: <0, 6, 8>
3. Triangle with nodes 1, 4, and 5: <1, 4, 5>
4. Triangle with nodes 3, 4, and 5: <3, 4, 5>
5. Triangle with nodes 3, 6, and 9: <3, 6, 9>
6. Triangle with nodes 3, 7, and 9: <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
