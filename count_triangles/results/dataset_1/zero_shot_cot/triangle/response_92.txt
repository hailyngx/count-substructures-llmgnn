Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 1.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6.

Now, let's find the triangles in this graph:

- Triangles involving node 0: []
- Triangles involving node 1: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 7>
- Triangles involving node 2: []
