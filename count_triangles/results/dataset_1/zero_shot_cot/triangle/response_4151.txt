Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify triangles by finding nodes that have edges connecting them forming triangles.
Step 2: List the unique triangles found.

Triangles:
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 3>
<8, 6, 9>
<8, 9, 4>

Total number of triangles: [10]
