Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's list out the triangles we can find in this graph:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <2, 4, 8>
3. <4, 8, 2>
4. <4, 3, 2>
5. <4, 3, 8>
6. <7, 1, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
