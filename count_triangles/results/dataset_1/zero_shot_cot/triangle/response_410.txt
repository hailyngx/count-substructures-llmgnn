Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges given.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 6.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

- Triangle 1: (1, 4, 9)
- Triangle 2: (2, 4, 6)
- Triangle 3: (2, 5, 6)
- Triangle 4: (3, 4, 9)
- Triangle 5: (3, 5, 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, and <3, 5, 6>.
