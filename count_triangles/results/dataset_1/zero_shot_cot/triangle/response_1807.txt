Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
When counting triangles in a graph, we are looking for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes. In this case, we can observe the triangles by considering each possible combination of three nodes from the given graph edges.

After checking all combinations, we find the following unique triangles:
1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 3, 6>
5. <2, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
