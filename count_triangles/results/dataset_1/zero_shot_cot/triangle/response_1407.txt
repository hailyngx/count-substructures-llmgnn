Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list down all the triangles formed in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 4>
4. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <5, 6, 7>

Now, let's count the number of triangles: [5]
