Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges to each other.

From the given edges:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Now, let's find the triangles:
1. Triangle <1, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
