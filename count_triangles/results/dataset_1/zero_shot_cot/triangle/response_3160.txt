Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the given edges.

Let's determine the triangles step-by-step:
1. Check node 0: 
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8. 
   - Possible triangles involving node 0: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 8>

2. Check node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
   - Possible triangles involving node 1: <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 9>

3. Check node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
   - No triangle can be formed involving only node 2.

4. Check node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
   - No triangle can be formed involving only node 3.

5. Check node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
   - Possible triangles involving node 4: <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>

6. Check node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9.
   - Possible triangles involving node 5: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>

7. Check node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
   - Possible triangles involving node 6: <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>

8. Check node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 8.
   - Possible triangles involving node 7: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 5>

9. Check node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to all other nodes except node 2.
   - Possible triangles involving node 8: <0, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <6, 8, 9>

10. Check node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
   - No triangle can be formed involving only node 9.

Count of triangles: 8
Triangles: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
