Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
- <4, 6, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>
- <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
