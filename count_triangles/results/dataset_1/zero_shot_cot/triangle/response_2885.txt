Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify triangles by checking for nodes that are connected to each other. 

- Triangle 1: Node 3, 6, 9
- Triangle 2: Node 4, 6, 9

Step 2: List the unique triangles found.

<3, 6, 9> 
<4, 6, 9>
