Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the steps to count the number of triangles in the given graph:
Step 1: Determine the triangles formed by each node:
- Node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 7, 8), (0, 8, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 5, 7), (1, 5, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 1, 4)
- Node 3: No triangles
- Node 4: (4, 2, 9)
- Node 5: (5, 1, 7), (5, 1, 8), (5, 7, 8)
- Node 6: No triangles
- Node 7: (7, 0, 5), (7, 5, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 0, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 0, 4), (9, 0, 8)

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles:
- Total number of triangles = 9
- Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 0, 2>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 1, 4>, <4, 2, 9>, <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
