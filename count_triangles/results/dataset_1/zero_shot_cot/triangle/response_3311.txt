Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all possible triangles by checking each set of three nodes that are connected by edges. 
After examining the given graph, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <0, 2, 5>
4. <0, 2, 8>
5. <0, 5, 8>
6. <0, 8, 9>
7. <0, 9, 6>
8. <1, 2, 8>
9. <2, 3, 5>
10. <4, 7, 9>
11. <8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
