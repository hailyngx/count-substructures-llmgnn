Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will need to identify all the unique triangles present in the graph. Let's go step by step.

Step 1: Build the adjacency list representation of the graph based on the given edges:
```
0: [4]
1: [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
2: [1, 3, 6]
3: [2, 4, 6, 7]
4: [0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9]
5: [1, 7, 8]
6: [1, 2, 3]
7: [1, 3, 4, 5]
8: [1, 4, 5]
9: [4]
```

Step 2: Identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (1, 2, 3)
- Triangle 2: (1, 4, 7)
- Triangle 3: (1, 5, 8)

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 8>
