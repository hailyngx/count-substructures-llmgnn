Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List out all triangles in the graph:
- (0, 1, 8)
- (0, 1, 9)
- (0, 2, 3)
- (0, 2, 9)
- (0, 8, 5)
- (0, 8, 6)
- (1, 8, 5)
- (1, 8, 6)
- (2, 3, 5)
- (2, 9, 6)
- (3, 4, 9)
- (3, 7, 4)
- (4, 5, 8)
- (4, 6, 9)
- (5, 8, 6)
- (7, 4, 9)
- (9, 6, 7)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles:
- Total number of triangles = 17

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
