Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by looking at every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can list each triangle found:

1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <2, 4, 5>
4. <3, 5, 7>
5. <4, 1, 2>
6. <4, 1, 9>
7. <4, 2, 5>
8. <4, 5, 9>
9. <5, 2, 4>
10. <5, 3, 4>
11. <6, 1, 8>
12. <8, 0, 6>
13. <8, 4, 9>
14. <9, 1, 4>
15. <9, 4, 8>

There are a total of 15 unique triangles in the graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
