Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will list the unique triangles found and then provide the total count.

The unique triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
