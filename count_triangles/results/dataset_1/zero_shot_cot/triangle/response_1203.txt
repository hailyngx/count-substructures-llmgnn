Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's enumerate the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
4. Triangle <1, 7, 2>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
6. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
8. Triangle <7, 1, 0>
9. Triangle <7, 2, 4>
10. Triangle <7, 2, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
