Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all the possible triangles by checking all combinations of nodes connected by edges. Let's list the unique triangles and then count them:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 2, 8>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <0, 6, 7>
6. <0, 7, 9>
7. <0, 8, 9>
8. <1, 7, 9>
9. <2, 5, 8>
10. <5, 7, 9>

There are 10 triangles in total. So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
