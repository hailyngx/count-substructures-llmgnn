Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 6)
- Triangle 2: (1, 3, 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6> and <1, 3, 6>.
