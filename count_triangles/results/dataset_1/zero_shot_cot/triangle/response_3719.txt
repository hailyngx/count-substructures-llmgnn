Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify all the triangles by examining each set of three nodes that are interconnected.

Looking at the list of edges provided, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 5, 2>
2. <0, 6, 6>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <0, 8, 7>
5. <1, 2, 4>
6. <1, 2, 7>
7. <1, 9, 6>
8. <2, 4, 6>
9. <2, 5, 7>
10. <4, 6, 7>
11. <6, 6, 8>
12. <6, 8, 9>
13. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is **13** [<0, 5, 2>, <0, 6, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 8, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 9, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>].
