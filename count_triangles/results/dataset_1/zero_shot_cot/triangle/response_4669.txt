Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
We can find the number of triangles in the graph by observing which nodes are connected in such a way that they form a triangular shape. Let's identify the triangles present in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 3>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 7, 8>
7. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
8. Triangle <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
