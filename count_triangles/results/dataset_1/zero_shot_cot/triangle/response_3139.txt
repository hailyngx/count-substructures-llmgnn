Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph and list them, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify triangles: To find triangles in a graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected by edges. In this case, we will look for all possible sets of three nodes connected to each other.

2. Count Triangles: Count the total number of unique triangles found in the graph.

Let's now go ahead and identify the triangles in the given graph:

The graph can be visually represented as follows:
```
0 --- 3
|\     |\
| \    | \
|  \   |  9
|   \  | /
|    \ |/
4 --- 2
 \     |
  \    |
   6   7
  /|\
 / | \
1  9  8
```

Now, let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <0, 6, 7>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <0, 7, 9>
5. <2, 4, 6>
6. <2, 6, 7>
7. <2, 6, 8>
8. <3, 0, 9>
9. <4, 6, 9>
10. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
