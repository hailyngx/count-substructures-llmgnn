Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that form a triangle. A triangle consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes. 

Let's analyze the connections in the graph provided to find the triangles:

- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
