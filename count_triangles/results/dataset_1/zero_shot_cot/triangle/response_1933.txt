Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other.

Upon examining the provided graph, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 8, 9>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <2, 5, 9>
4. <3, 5, 9>
5. <5, 7, 9>
6. <5, 8, 9>
7. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
