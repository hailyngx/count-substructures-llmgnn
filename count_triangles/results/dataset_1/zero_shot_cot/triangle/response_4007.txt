Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are mutually connected.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:
1. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 4>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
5. Triangle <3, 2, 4>
6. Triangle <4, 7, 5>
7. Triangle <4, 8, 2>
8. Triangle <4, 8, 9>
9. Triangle <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
