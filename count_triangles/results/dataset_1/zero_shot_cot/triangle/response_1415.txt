Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

From the provided edges, it can be observed that there is a triangle whenever three nodes are interconnected in the graph. Let's identify all such triangles:

1. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
2. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
3. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <5, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
