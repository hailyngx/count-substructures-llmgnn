Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by 3 connected nodes. Let's consider each possible triangle in the graph.

1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
6. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
7. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
8. Triangle <0, 4, 3>
9. Triangle <4, 3, 8>
10. Triangle <4, 8, 5>
11. Triangle <0, 9, 1>
12. Triangle <1, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
