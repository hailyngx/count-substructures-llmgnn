Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes.

1. Start by listing all triangles in the graph:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 8, 3>
- <1, 8, 4>
- <1, 8, 5>
- <1, 8, 7>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <8, 9, 7>

2. Count the total number of triangles from the list above. 

Total number of triangles: [24]
