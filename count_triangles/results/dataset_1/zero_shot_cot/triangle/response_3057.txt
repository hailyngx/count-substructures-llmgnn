Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given graph:

```
    0 -- 9
    |    
    9 -- 8
    | /  |
    7 -- 1 -- 6
    |    | /
    8    3 -- 5
         |    |
         2 -- 4
```

Following are the triangles in the graph:
1. <3, 5, 6>
2. <3, 5, 7>
3. <3, 6, 7>
4. <5, 6, 7>
5. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
