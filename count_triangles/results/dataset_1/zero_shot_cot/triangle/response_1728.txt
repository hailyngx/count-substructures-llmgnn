Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 1.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
6. Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 1.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle between nodes 0, 1, and 9.
2. Triangle between nodes 0, 6, and 9.
3. Triangle between nodes 1, 8, and 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, and <1, 8, 9>.
