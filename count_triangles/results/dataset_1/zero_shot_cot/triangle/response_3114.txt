Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected.

By examining the edges provided, we can determine the following triangles:
1. Triangle <3, 5, 8>
2. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
