Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in this graph, we can look for each possible triangle involving three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in this graph:
1. <2, 8, 6>
2. <2, 8, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
