Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to identify and count the triangles:

1. Starting with node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
   - Potential triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, 3> and <0, 1, 6>.

2. Moving to node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 7.
   - We have already identified the triangle <0, 1, 3>.
   - Potential triangle involving node 1: <0, 1, 7>.

3. Considering node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
   - No new triangles involving node 2 are formed.

4. Focusing on node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
   - No new triangles involving node 3 are formed.

5. Exploring node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
   - No triangles are formed with node 4.

6. Checking node 5:
   - Node 5 is only connected to node 7, so no triangles are formed with node 5.

7. Examining node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9.
   - We have already identified the triangle <0, 1, 6>.
   - Potential triangle involving node 6: <0, 6, 9>.

8. Focusing on node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
   - We have already identified the triangle <0, 1, 7>.

9. Considering node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
   - No new triangles involving node 8 are formed.

10. Exploring node 9:
   - Node 9 is only connected to node 6, so no triangles are formed with node 9.

After examining all nodes, we have found three triangles:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
