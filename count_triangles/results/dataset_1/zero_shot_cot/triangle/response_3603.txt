Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
From the given graph, we can find the following triangles:
1. Node 0, 1, 7 - <0, 1, 7>
2. Node 1, 3, 7 - <1, 3, 7>
3. Node 1, 4, 9 - <1, 4, 9>
4. Node 2, 6, 8 - <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
