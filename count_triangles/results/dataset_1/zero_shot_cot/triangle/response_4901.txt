Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's first list all the triangles in the given graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 3>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 4: <4, 3, 6>
- Triangle 5: <1, 6, 3>
- Triangle 6: <1, 6, 7>
- Triangle 7: <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle 8: <1, 7, 8>
- Triangle 9: <1, 8, 2>
- Triangle 10: <6, 3, 4>
- Triangle 11: <8, 1, 6>

Hence, there are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
