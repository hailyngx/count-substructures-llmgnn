Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify the triangles based on the given edges.

- (0, 1), (1, 5), (5, 0) form a triangle.
- (0, 1), (1, 6), (6, 0) form a triangle.
- (0, 1), (1, 8), (8, 0) form a triangle.
- (2, 3), (3, 9), (9, 2) form a triangle.
- (2, 7), (7, 4), (4, 2) form a triangle.
- (2, 7), (7, 8), (8, 2) form a triangle.
- (3, 9), (9, 5), (5, 3) form a triangle.

Step 2: List the unique triangles found.

<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 5, 9>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of triangles.

The total number of triangles is [7].
