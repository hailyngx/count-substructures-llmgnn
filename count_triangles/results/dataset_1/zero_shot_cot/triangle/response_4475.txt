Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to Node 2.
2. Node 1 is connected to Nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 3, and 4.
4. Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to Nodes 2 and 3.
6. Node 5 is connected to Node 3.
7. Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1 and 3.
9. Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1 and 6.

Now, let's identify the unique triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
