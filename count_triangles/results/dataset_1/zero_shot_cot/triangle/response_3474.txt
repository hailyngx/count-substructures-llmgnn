Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
From the given graph, we can identify the triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other forming a closed loop of three edges. Let's count the number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 5, 2>
6. Triangle <1, 5, 0>
7. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
8. Triangle <2, 3, 1>
9. Triangle <3, 1, 8>
10. Triangle <3, 1, 5>
11. Triangle <5, 0, 7>
12. Triangle <5, 1, 7>
13. Triangle <5, 1, 2>
14. Triangle <5, 1, 0>
15. Triangle <5, 1, 6>
16. Triangle <7, 0, 1>
17. Triangle <7, 0, 5>
18. Triangle <7, 1, 5>
19. Triangle <7, 1, 0>
20. Triangle <7, 1, 6>
21. Triangle <7, 6, 5>

Therefore, there are 21 triangles in total in the given graph. Hence, the output is [21].
