Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. From the given edges, identify all the possible triangles formed by connecting three nodes:
   - Possible triangles involving node 0: 
     - (0, 1) & (1, 4) & (4, 0) => <0, 1, 4>
     - (0, 5) & (5, 3) & (3, 0) => <0, 5, 3>
     - (0, 6) & (6, 2) & (2, 0) => <0, 6, 2>

2. Calculate the total number of triangles (considering uniqueness) found above.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
