Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. 

The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, and <4, 5, 6>.
