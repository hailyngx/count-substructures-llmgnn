Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 2
- Node 2: degree = 6
- Node 3: degree = 2
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 3
- Node 6: degree = 3
- Node 7: degree = 1
- Node 8: degree = 3
- Node 9: degree = 3

Step 2: Identify triangles in the graph.
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle 2: <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 5, 6>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles = [3]
