Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that form a triangle. Each triangle consists of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <2, 4, 7>
3. <2, 7, 5>
4. <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
