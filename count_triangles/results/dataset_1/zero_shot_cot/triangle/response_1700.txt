Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected to each other. We will go through each unique combination of three nodes and check if there is an edge between each pair of nodes.

The triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
