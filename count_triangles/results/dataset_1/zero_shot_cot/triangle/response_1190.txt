Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph and list them step-by-step.

1. Triangle 1: (0, 9, 1)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 3, 1)
3. Triangle 3: (0, 9, 6)
4. Triangle 4: (1, 9, 6)

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 9, 1>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 9, 6>, and <1, 9, 6>.
