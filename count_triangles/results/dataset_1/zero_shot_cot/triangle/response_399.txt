Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 1.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 9.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
8. Node 8 is connected to node 1.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 9)
- Triangle 2: (1, 3, 7)
- Triangle 3: (1, 5, 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, and <1, 5, 6>.
