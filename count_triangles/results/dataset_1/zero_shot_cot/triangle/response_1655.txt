Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to consider each possible set of three nodes and check if there is an edge between each pair of nodes in the set.

Let's analyze the graph step by step to find the number of triangles:

1. Node 0: Neighbors are {1, 2, 5}.
2. Node 1: Neighbors are {0, 3, 4, 7}.
3. Node 2: Neighbors are {0, 7}.
4. Node 3: Neighbors are {1, 7}.
5. Node 4: Neighbors are {1, 9}.
6. Node 5: Neighbors are {0, 8, 9}.
7. Node 6: Neighbor is {9}.
8. Node 7: Neighbors are {1, 2, 3}.
9. Node 8: Neighbor is {5}.
10. Node 9: Neighbors are {4, 5, 6}.

Now, let's find the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>.
2. Triangle <1, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
