Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by finding all possible triangles formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly.

After going through all the edges in the given graph, we can list the unique triangles as follows:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <5, 6, 7>
6. <1, 4, 6>
7. <0, 7, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [7].
