Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Check each possible triangle formed by 3 nodes:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 4, 6)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 4, 7)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 4, 9)
   - Triangle 4: (0, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 5: (0, 6, 9)
   - Triangle 6: (0, 7, 9)
   - Triangle 7: (4, 3, 5)
   - Triangle 8: (4, 5, 6)
   - Triangle 9: (4, 5, 7)
   - Triangle 10: (5, 3, 7)

2. List the unique triangles found:
   - <0, 4, 6>
   - <0, 4, 7>
   - <0, 4, 9>
   - <4, 3, 5>
   - <4, 5, 6>
   - <5, 3, 7>

3. Count the total number of triangles: [6]

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.
