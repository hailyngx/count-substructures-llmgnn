Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we can count the total number of triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

Let's go through each possible triangle in the graph:

1. (0, 1, 3)
2. (0, 1, 4)
3. (0, 1, 7)
4. (1, 3, 5)
5. (1, 3, 7)
6. (1, 4, 7)
7. (3, 5, 7)
8. (5, 7, 8)
9. (5, 8, 9)

So, we have found 9 unique triangles. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
