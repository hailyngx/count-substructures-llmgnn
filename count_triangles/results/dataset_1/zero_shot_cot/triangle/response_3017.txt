Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.

Now, identifying the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 4: <0, 6, 4>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 6: <4, 7, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. So, the output would be [6].
