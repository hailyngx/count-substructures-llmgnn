   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
   - Therefore, the triangle involving node 6 is <6, 4, 8>.

8. Check for triangles involving node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 8.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
   - Therefore, no triangles are formed with node 7.

9. Check for triangles involving node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8.
