Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's list out the triangles one by one:

1. <0, 7, 4>
2. <0, 7, 8>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <1, 4, 2>
5. <3, 8, 4>
6. <3, 9, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
