Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected by edges.

Analyzing the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to node 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 4>
4. Triangle <1, 3, 7>

Hence, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
