Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <3, 5, 7>
5. <3, 5, 9>
6. <3, 7, 8>
7. <8, 9, 3>

Counting these triangles, we have a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
