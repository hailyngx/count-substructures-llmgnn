Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in a graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's list the unique triangles:

1. <1, 2, 7>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <1, 5, 6>
4. <2, 7, 9>
5. <3, 6, 7>
6. <3, 7, 8>
7. <4, 6, 7>
8. <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total [8].
