Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all sets of three nodes that form a complete subgraph (triangle). Here's the breakdown:

1. Nodes with their neighbors:
   - Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 7}
   - Node 1: {0, 5}
   - Node 2: {4, 8, 9}
   - Node 4: {2, 6, 7}
   - Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 8}
   - Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7}
   - Node 7: {0, 4, 6, 8}
   - Node 8: {2, 5, 7}
   - Node 9: {2}
   
2. Triangles found:
   - <0, 1, 5>
   - <0, 5, 6>
   - <0, 6, 7>
   - <4, 6, 7>
   - <5, 6, 8>
   - <2, 8, 9>
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
