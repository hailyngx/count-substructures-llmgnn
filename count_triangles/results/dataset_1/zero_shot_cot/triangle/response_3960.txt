Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the graph by examining each possible combination of three nodes:
1. (0, 2, 4)
2. (0, 2, 5)
3. (0, 4, 5)
4. (2, 4, 7)
5. (2, 4, 9)
6. (2, 3, 7)
7. (4, 5, 0)
8. (6, 7, 8)

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8] which are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 5, 0>, <6, 7, 8>.
