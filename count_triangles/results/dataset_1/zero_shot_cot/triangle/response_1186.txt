Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. 

Let's find the triangles step-by-step by looking at each possible triangle formed by the nodes.

1. Possible triangles involving Node 0:
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <0, 3, 7>
   - <0, 5, 1>
   - <0, 7, 4>
   - <0, 8, 1>

2. Possible triangles involving Node 1:
   - <1, 5, 8>

3. Possible triangles involving Node 2:
   - <2, 4, 3>
   - <2, 4, 7>

4. Possible triangles involving Node 3:
   - <3, 4, 7>

5. Possible triangles involving Node 4: 
   (No new triangles as all are already considered)

6. Possible triangles involving Node 5:
   - <5, 9, 1>
   - <5, 9, 4>

7. Possible triangles involving Node 7:
   - <7, 2, 4>

8. Possible triangles involving Node 8:
   (No new triangles as all are already considered)

Therefore, we identified the following unique triangles:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 5, 1>
- <0, 7, 4>
- <0, 8, 1>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <2, 4, 3>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <5, 9, 1>
- <5, 9, 4>
- <7, 2, 4>

Total number of triangles: [12]
