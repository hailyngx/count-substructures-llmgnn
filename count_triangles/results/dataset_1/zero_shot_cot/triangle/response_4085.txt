Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's follow a step-by-step approach to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Identify the triangles:
   - A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.
   - We can look for triangles by checking for nodes that have mutual connections.

2. List the unique triangles:
   - By looking at the edges given, we can identify the following unique triangles:
     - <0, 2, 4>
     - <1, 5, 8>
     - <1, 6, 7>

3. Count the total number of triangles:
   - There are 3 unique triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
