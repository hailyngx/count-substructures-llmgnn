Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine the triangles formed by each set of three connected nodes. 

Looking at the edges provided, the possible triangles are:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <7, 8, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
