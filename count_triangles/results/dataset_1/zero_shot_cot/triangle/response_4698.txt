Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can use the concept that a triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. We can analyze the graph provided to identify the triangles.

First, let's list out the triangles one by one:  
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
