Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Here are the steps for finding the triangles:

1. Look for all possible triangles using the given edges:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 3, 7)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 2, 8)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 3, 4)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 3, 9)
   - Triangle 5: (3, 5, 6)
   - Triangle 6: (5, 6, 9)
   - Triangle 7: (5, 7, 9)

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 7

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 3, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>, and <5, 7, 9>.
