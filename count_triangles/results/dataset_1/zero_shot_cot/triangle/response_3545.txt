Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3)

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's list the unique triangles:

1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 1, 2>
3. <0, 1, 3>
4. <0, 1, 5>
5. <0, 3, 8>
6. <2, 1, 3>

Total number of triangles: [6]
