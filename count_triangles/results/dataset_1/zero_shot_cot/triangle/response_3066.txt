Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's list down the triangles we can find in the given graph:

1. <1, 3, 6>
2. <1, 3, 7>
3. <1, 3, 8>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <1, 6, 7>
6. <1, 7, 8>
7. <1, 7, 9>
8. <1, 8, 9>
9. <3, 4, 9>
10. <3, 5, 8>
11. <3, 8, 7>
12. <3, 9, 7>

There are 12 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
