Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all the triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.
3. List the unique triangles.

Let's go ahead and find the number of triangles in the graph:

The total number of triangles in the graph is [7].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<3, 5, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
