Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes with their respective connections:
   - 0: 1, 5, 7, 9
   - 1: 0, 5, 9
   - 3: 8, 9
   - 4: 5, 7, 8, 9
   - 5: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
   - 6: 5, 7, 9
   - 7: 0, 4, 5, 6
   - 8: 3, 4
   - 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6

2. Identify triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 5, 9)
   - Triangle 2: (4, 5, 9)

So, there are total [2] triangles in this graph, specifically <0, 5, 9> and <4, 5, 9>.
