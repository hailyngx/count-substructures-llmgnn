Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node in the graph.

\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline
\text{Node} & \text{Degree} \\ \hline
0 & 5 \\ \hline
2 & 3 \\ \hline
3 & 4 \\ \hline
4 & 3 \\ \hline
5 & 4 \\ \hline
6 & 1 \\ \hline
7 & 3 \\ \hline
8 & 2 \\ \hline
9 & 4 \\ \hline
\end{array} \]

Step 2: Identify the triangles in the graph.

The triangles in the graph are the combinations of three nodes where each pair of nodes is connected by an edge.

\[ \text{Triangles:} \]
\[ <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 9, 7>, <2, 5, 3>, <3, 5, 4>, <7, 9, 3>, <7, 9, 0> \]

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [8]
