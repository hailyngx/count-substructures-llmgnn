Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we will look for all the triangles by checking each possible combination of 3 nodes that form a closed loop. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <1, 5, 8>
4. <1, 7, 8>
5. <2, 3, 6>
6. <3, 4, 8>
7. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
