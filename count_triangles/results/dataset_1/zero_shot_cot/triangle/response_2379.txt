Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

First, let's list all the triangles we can find in the graph:

1. <1, 3, 6>
2. <1, 3, 7>
3. <2, 3, 7>
4. <3, 4, 7>
5. <3, 5, 6>
6. <4, 5, 8>
7. <4, 7, 8>

Counting the unique triangles, we have found 7 triangles in total. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
