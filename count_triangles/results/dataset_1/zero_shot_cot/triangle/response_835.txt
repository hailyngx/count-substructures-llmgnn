Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first identify the triangles present in the graph based on the given edges.

1. Each triangle consists of three nodes connected by edges to form a closed loop.
2. We need to check for each node if there are edges connecting pairs of nodes that can form triangles.
3. The total number of triangles will be the combination of unique sets of three nodes that form closed loops.

Let's start by listing all the possible triangles:

Possible triangles:
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <8, 9, 4>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <8, 9, 5>
- <2, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles = 8
