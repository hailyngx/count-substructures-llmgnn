Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can first identify the triangles formed by the connected nodes and then count them. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <2, 3, 5>
2. <3, 5, 6>
3. <5, 6, 7>

The total number of triangles is [3].
