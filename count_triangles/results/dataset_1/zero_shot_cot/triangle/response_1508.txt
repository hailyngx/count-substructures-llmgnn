Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, and <0, 8, 9>.
