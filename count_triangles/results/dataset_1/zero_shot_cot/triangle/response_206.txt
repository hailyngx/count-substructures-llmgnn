Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangles involving node 0: None
2. Triangles involving node 1: None
3. Triangles involving node 2: None
4. Triangles involving node 3: None
5. Triangles involving node 4: <2, 4, 6>
6. Triangles involving node 5: None
7. Triangles involving node 6: <2, 4, 6>
8. Triangles involving node 7: <4, 7, 9>
9. Triangles involving node 8: None
10. Triangles involving node 9: None

Counting the unique triangles above, we have a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
