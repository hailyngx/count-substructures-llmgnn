Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:
1. Nodes 0, 8, 9 form a triangle: <0, 8, 9>
2. Nodes 3, 4, 7 form a triangle: <3, 4, 7>
3. Nodes 5, 6, 8 form a triangle: <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
