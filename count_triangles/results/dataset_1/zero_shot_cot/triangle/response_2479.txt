Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. In this case, node 0, 1, and 2 form a triangle since there are edges connecting 0-1, 1-0, 0-2, and 2-0. Similarly, <2, 4, 8> and <1, 6, 8> form triangles. 

Counting these triangles, we find three triangles in total, which are: <0, 1, 2>, <2, 4, 8>, and <1, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
