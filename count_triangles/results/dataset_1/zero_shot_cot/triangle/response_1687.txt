Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all connected triples of nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <3, 4, 9>
4. <6, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
