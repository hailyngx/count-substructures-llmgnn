Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, and <4, 6, 8>.
