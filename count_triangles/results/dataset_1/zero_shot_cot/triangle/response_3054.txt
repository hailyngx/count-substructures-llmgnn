Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <0, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
