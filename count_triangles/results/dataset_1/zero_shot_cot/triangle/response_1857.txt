Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges. 

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 8, 5>
- <2, 3, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
