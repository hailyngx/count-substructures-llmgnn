Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle involving nodes (0, 2, 4)
2. Triangle involving nodes (2, 6, 7)
3. Triangle involving nodes (2, 6, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
