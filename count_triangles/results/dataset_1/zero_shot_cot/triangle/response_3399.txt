Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Let's analyze the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to node 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.

Let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 2, 3: <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle involving nodes 0, 6, 1: <0, 6, 1>
3. Triangle involving nodes 0, 6, 3: <0, 6, 3>
4. Triangle involving nodes 0, 3, 8: <0, 3, 8>
5. Triangle involving nodes 1, 6, 8: <1, 6, 8>
6. Triangle involving nodes 1, 4, 7: <1, 4, 7>
7. Triangle involving nodes 3, 6, 8: <3, 6, 8>
8. Triangle involving nodes 8, 7, 4: <8, 7, 4>
9. Triangle involving nodes 8, 7, 1: <8, 7, 1>
10. Triangle involving nodes 8, 9, 5: <8, 9, 5>

So, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
