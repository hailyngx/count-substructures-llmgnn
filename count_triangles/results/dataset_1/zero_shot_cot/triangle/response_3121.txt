Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Node pairs connected by an edge:
   - (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 6), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 8)

2. Let's identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 2: (3, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 3: (3, 5, 8)
   - Triangle 4: (4, 5, 8)

3. Count of triangles: [4]
   
Here are the unique triangles found:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 8>
