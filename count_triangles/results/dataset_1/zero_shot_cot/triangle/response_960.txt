Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

1. Triangle <1, 2, 9>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <3, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [4]
