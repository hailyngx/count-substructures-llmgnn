Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list out the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
4. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
5. Triangle <6, 8, 9>
6. Triangle <1, 2, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.

The number of triangles in the graph is [6].
