Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

1. Nodes with three edges:  
    - Node 0 has edges with nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
    - Node 1 has edges with nodes 0, 7, and 8.
    - Node 2 has edges with nodes 3, 4, and 7.
    - Node 3 has edges with nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9.
    - Node 4 has edges with nodes 2, 3, and 6.
    - Node 5 has edges with nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9.
    - Node 7 has edges with nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8.
  
2. Now, let's find the triangles:
    - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 8>
    - Triangle 2: <0, 3, 5>
    - Triangle 3: <0, 5, 7>
  
Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
