Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected.

Let's label the nodes for easier reference:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 6
- Node 7
- Node 8
- Node 9

Now, let's list all the unique triangles:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <1, 6, 2>
5. <2, 9, 3>
6. <3, 7, 8>
7. <3, 6, 1>
8. <3, 6, 2>
9. <3, 6, 9>
10. <7, 8, 3>
11. <8, 3, 7>
12. <9, 2, 3>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
