Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Identify all the triangles formed by nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected with edges.
2. Count the total number of triangles in the graph.

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 6, 3>
3. <2, 5, 9>
4. <2, 7, 8>
5. <3, 5, 9>
6. <4, 0, 6>
7. <5, 2, 3>
8. <6, 0, 3>
9. <6, 8, 9>
10. <8, 2, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
