Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will examine all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges to form a closed loop.

Let's list down the unique triangles in the graph:
1. <2, 4, 8>
2. <2, 5, 3>
3. <2, 5, 6>
4. <2, 6, 8>
5. <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
