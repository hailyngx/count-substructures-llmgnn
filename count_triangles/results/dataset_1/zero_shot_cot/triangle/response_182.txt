Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, and <4, 7, 8>.
