Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by three nodes connected to each other.

By observing the given edges, the possible triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <3, 4, 9>
4. <3, 5, 6>
5. <3, 6, 7>
6. <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
