Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, we can identify the triangles by finding sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's list the triangles one by one:

1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 6, 9>
5. <2, 4, 7>
6. <3, 6, 7>
7. <3, 6, 9>
8. <5, 8, 9>
9. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
