Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's determine the number of triangles present.

Let's list the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <3, 4, 6>
3. <3, 4, 8>
4. <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
