Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's break this down step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6.

Now, let's determine the triangles:
- <0, 3, 9>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
