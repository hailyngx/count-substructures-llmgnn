Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 4 and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 7.

Now, let's find the triangles (closed loops of length 3) in this graph:
- Triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 9>

Count of Triangles: [3]
