Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.
