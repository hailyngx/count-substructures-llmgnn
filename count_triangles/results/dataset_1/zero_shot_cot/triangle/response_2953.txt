Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the connected nodes.

Let's start by listing out the triangles found in the graph:

1. <2, 0, 8>
2. <2, 5, 6>
3. <2, 5, 9>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <3, 5, 6>
6. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
