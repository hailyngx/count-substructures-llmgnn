Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles present. Let's go step-by-step to find them.

Given edges:
- (0, 1)   -   Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- (0, 5)
- (0, 6)
- (1, 3)
- (1, 8)
- (1, 9)  -   Triangle <1, 9, 2>
- (2, 9)
- (3, 1)
- (4, 7)
- (5, 0)
- (6, 0)  -   Triangle <6, 0, 9>
- (6, 9)
- (7, 4)
- (7, 9)
- (8, 1)
- (9, 2)
- (9, 6)
- (9, 7)  -   Triangle <9, 7, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
