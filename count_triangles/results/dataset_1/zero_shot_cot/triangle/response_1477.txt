Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 6>
6. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
7. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
