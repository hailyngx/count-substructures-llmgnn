Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all possible triangles by checking for nodes that are connected in a way that forms a closed loop with three edges.

Here are the unique triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 6, 8>
2. <2, 3, 6>
3. <2, 5, 6>
4. <2, 5, 7>
5. <3, 6, 7>
6. <8, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
