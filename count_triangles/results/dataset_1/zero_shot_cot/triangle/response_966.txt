Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every possible triangle formed by connecting three nodes directly. Let's break this down step by step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes {0, 3, 8}.
3. Node 2 forms no triangles as it only has edges with other nodes but no closed triangle.
4. Node 3 forms triangles with nodes {1, 4, 5, 7}.
5. Node 4 forms triangles with nodes {0, 3, 5}.
6. Node 5 forms triangles with nodes {0, 2, 3, 7}.
7. Node 6 forms no triangles as it only has edges with other nodes but no closed triangle.
8. Node 7 forms triangles with nodes {2, 3, 5, 6}.
9. Node 8 forms no triangles as it only has edges with nodes {0, 1}.
10. Node 9 forms no triangles as it only has an edge with node 0.

Now, let's list down the unique triangles we found:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is:
