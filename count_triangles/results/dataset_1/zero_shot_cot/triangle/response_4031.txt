Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

We will look for triangles by checking each possible set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Triangle 1: (1, 2, 4)
2. Triangle 2: (2, 4, 9)
3. Triangle 3: (3, 4, 9)
4. Triangle 4: (0, 7, 8)
5. Triangle 5: (2, 6, 9)
6. Triangle 6: (3, 5, 7)
7. Triangle 7: (6, 8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
