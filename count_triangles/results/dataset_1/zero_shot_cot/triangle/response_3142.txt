Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.

Now, let's determine the triangles (cycles of length 3) in this graph:

1. <0, 6, 7>
2. <0, 1, 2>
3. <0, 1, 3>
4. <0, 6, 3>
5. <0, 6, 4>
6. <1, 2, 4>
7. <1, 3, 6>
8. <2, 4, 6>
9. <6, 5, 0>
10. <6, 5, 4>
11. <6, 7, 0>
12. <6, 7, 9>
13. <6, 7, 1>
14. <6, 9, 3>
15. <7, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
