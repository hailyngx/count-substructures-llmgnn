Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's examine each possible triangle:

1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 2, and 3: This triangle is formed by the edges (0, 2), (0, 3), and (2, 3).
2. Triangle involving nodes 0, 3, and 8: This triangle is formed by the edges (0, 3), (0, 8), and (3, 8).
3. Triangle involving nodes 0, 7, and 8: There is no such triangle as there is no edge between nodes 0 and 7.
4. Triangle involving nodes 0, 7, and 3: This triangle is formed by the edges (0, 8), (0, 3), and (8, 3).
5. Triangle involving nodes 2, 3, and 7: This triangle is formed by the edges (2, 3), (2, 7), and (3, 7).
6. Triangle involving nodes 3, 7, and 8: This triangle is formed by the edges (3, 7), (3, 8), and (7, 8).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 4, and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, and <2, 3, 7>.

So, the output is: [4].
