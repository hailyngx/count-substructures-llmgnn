Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triangles formed by 3 connected nodes. Let's list all the unique triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <2, 1, 5>
4. <2, 5, 9>
5. <3, 6, 7>
6. <5, 2, 9>
7. <5, 7, 9>
8. <7, 3, 8>
9. <7, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
