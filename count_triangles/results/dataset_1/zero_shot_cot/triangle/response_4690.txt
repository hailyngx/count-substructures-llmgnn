Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify them by looking for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the edge list, let's identify the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 3, 0)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 6, 1)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 7, 1)
4. Triangle 4: (3, 0, 3)
5. Triangle 5: (4, 5, 4)
6. Triangle 6: (4, 6, 4)
7. Triangle 7: (5, 4, 5)
8. Triangle 8: (6, 1, 6)
9. Triangle 9: (6, 4, 6)
10. Triangle 10: (1, 7, 1)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 0>
<1, 6, 1>
<1, 7, 1>
<4, 5, 4>
<4, 6, 4>
