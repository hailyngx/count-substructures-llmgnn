Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are fully connected to each other. Let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 8>
3. Triangle <8, 5, 6>

There are a total of 3 triangles in the given graph.

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
