Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 5:
   - No new triangles are formed.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 5:
   - No new triangles are formed.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5:
   - Triangle 2: <0, 2, 3>
   - Triangle 3: <2, 3, 5>

5. Node 4 is connected to node 8:
   - No new triangles are formed.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 9:
   - No new triangles are formed.

7. Node 6 is connected to node 7:
   - No new triangles are formed.

8. Node 7 is connected to node 6:
   - No new triangles are formed.

9. Node 8 is connected to node 4:
   - No new triangles are formed.

10. Node 9 is connected to node 5:
   - No new triangles are formed.

Count of triangles = 3
Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 3> 
<2, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
