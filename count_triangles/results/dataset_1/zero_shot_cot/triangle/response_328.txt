Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's analyze the graph step by step to find the total number of triangles.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 4, 3>
2. <0, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
