Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles present:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <0, 6, 8>
5. <1, 3, 9>
6. <1, 5, 7>
7. <2, 4, 8>
8. <2, 9, 3>
9. <3, 5, 7>
10. <4, 6, 8>
11. <7, 5, 1>
12. <8, 6, 0>
13. <9, 3, 1>
14. <0, 2, 9>

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in total. So, the answer is [14].
