Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we will first analyze each unique triangle formed by three nodes. Then, we will count the total number of triangles. Here we go:

Potential triangles in the graph:
- <0, 6, 1>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 1>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 8, 4>
- <4, 8, 7>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <7, 5, 9>
- <7, 6, 9>
- <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [16]
