Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the given graph to make it easier to identify the triangles formed by the edges:

```
    0 --- 6        8
     \    |       /
      \   |      /
       \  |     /
         1 -- 4
        /|   |
       / |   |
      2  5   9
       \     |
        \    |
          3  7
```

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangles containing node 1: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 4, 5), (1, 5, 6), (1, 6, 9)
2. Triangles containing node 2: (2, 1, 4), (2, 1, 5), (2, 1, 6), (2, 1, 3)
3. Triangles containing node 3: (3, 1, 4), (3, 1, 5), (3, 1, 6), (3, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (3, 5, 6), (3, 6, 9), (3, 2, 7)
4. Triangles containing node 4: (4, 1, 5)
5. Triangles containing node 6: (6, 1, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
