Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we can examine each possible triangle formed by three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

By looking at the edges given:
- (0, 3) (0, 8) (3, 8) form a triangle <0, 3, 8>
- (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 7) also form a triangle <2, 3, 7>
- (2, 7) (5, 7) (2, 5) form another triangle <2, 5, 7>
- (2, 9) (3, 9) (2, 3) are part of a triangle <2, 3, 9>
- (3, 9) (4, 9) (3, 4) form a triangle <3, 4, 9>

Hence, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
