Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
1. Triangle formed by nodes 2, 3, and 4.
2. Triangle formed by nodes 3, 5, and 6.
3. Triangle formed by nodes 2, 7, and 8.
4. Triangle formed by nodes 2, 4, and 6.
5. Triangle formed by nodes 6, 7, and 8.

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
