Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will have to identify the triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's first list all the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <2, 4, 7>
3. <5, 6, 8>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
