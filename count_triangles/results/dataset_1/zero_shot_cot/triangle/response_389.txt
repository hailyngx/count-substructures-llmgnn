Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Now, let's list down the unique triangles:

1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <3, 4, 8>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <4, 5, 9>

Now that we have listed all the unique triangles, we count the total number of triangles which is [6].
