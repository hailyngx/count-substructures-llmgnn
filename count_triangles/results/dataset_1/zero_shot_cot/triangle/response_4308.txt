Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [7] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 9, 6>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 8, 9>, and <7, 4, 1>.
