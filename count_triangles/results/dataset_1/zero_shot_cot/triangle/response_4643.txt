Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
1. Identify the triangles:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
   - Node 2 is connected to node 4.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 9.
   - Node 5 is connected to node 0.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
   - Node 7 is connected to node 9.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.

2. Count the number of triangles:
