Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each node's neighbors and check for triangles formed by these neighbors. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's determine the triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0: Neighbors (3, 4, 5, 6)
   - Triangles: None

2. Node 1: Neighbors (2, 4, 8)
   - Triangles: None

3. Node 2: Neighbors (1, 4, 6, 8)
   - Triangles: None

4. Node 3: Neighbors (0, 6)
   - Triangles: None

5. Node 4: Neighbors (0, 1, 2, 9)
   - Triangles: <0, 1, 2>

6. Node 5: Neighbors (0, 9)
   - Triangles: None

7. Node 6: Neighbors (0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9)
   - Triangles: None

8. Node 7: Neighbors (6)
   - Triangles: None

9. Node 8: Neighbors (1, 2, 6)
   - Triangles: None

10. Node 9: Neighbors (4, 5, 6)
    - Triangles: None

Total number of triangles: [1]  
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>
