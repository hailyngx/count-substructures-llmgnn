Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all the possible triangles formed by the edges given. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Identify all triangles by checking each possible combination of three nodes that form a cycle:
   - For each node, check its neighbors and see if there are common neighbors forming a triangle.

2. Calculate the total number of triangles.

Let's list the unique triangles found along the way.

The total number of triangles is [6]. The unique triangles are <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, and <3, 5, 7>.
