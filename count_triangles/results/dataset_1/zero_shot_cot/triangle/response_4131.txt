Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected by edges to form triangles.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 6, 9>
2. <0, 9, 6>
3. <1, 2, 8>
4. <2, 3, 7>
5. <2, 7, 3>
6. <2, 7, 8>
7. <4, 7, 9>
8. <5, 7, 9>
9. <6, 0, 9>
10. <7, 2, 8>
11. <9, 4, 7>
12. <9, 5, 7>
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
