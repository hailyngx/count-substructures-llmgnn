Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible combinations of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

By examining the given edges, we can see that there are two unique triangles in this graph: <2, 3, 4> and <6, 7, 8>.

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
