Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every possible triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges.

Let's list down the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 3, 8>
4. <1, 5, 7>
5. <2, 5, 7>
6. <2, 7, 8>
7. <3, 4, 6>
8. <3, 4, 8>
9. <4, 6, 3>
10. <4, 6, 2>
11. <5, 7, 2>
12. <5, 7, 1>
13. <6, 4, 0>
14. <6, 4, 3>
15. <7, 5, 1>
16. <7, 5, 2>
17. <8, 3, 0>
18. <8, 3, 2>

Therefore, there are a total of [18] triangles in the given graph.
