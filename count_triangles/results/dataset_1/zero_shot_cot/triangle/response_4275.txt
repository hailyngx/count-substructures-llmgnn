Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles present in the graph:
1. Nodes (0, 4, 1)
2. Nodes (0, 4, 9)
3. Nodes (0, 7, 1)
4. Nodes (1, 4, 9)
5. Nodes (1, 4, 7)
6. Nodes (1, 7, 9)
7. Nodes (3, 5, 7)
8. Nodes (4, 9, 1)
9. Nodes (5, 3, 7)

Counting the unique triangles, we have 9 triangles in total. So, the total number of triangles in this graph is [9].
