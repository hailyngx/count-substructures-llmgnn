Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph by examining each possible triangle formed by the edges provided.

1. From node 0:
   - Triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>

2. From node 1:
   - Triangles: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 9>

3. From node 2:
   - Triangles: <2, 4, 9>

4. From node 3:
   - Triangles: <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 7, 9>

5. From node 4:
   - No new triangles.

6. From node 5:
   - No new triangles.

7. From node 6:
   - No new triangles.

8. From node 7:
   - No new triangles.

9. From node 8:
   - No new triangles.

10. From node 9:
   - No new triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
