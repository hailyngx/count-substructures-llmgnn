Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
   - Node 0: [3, 5, 7]
   - Node 1: [4, 7, 9]
   - Node 2: [8]
   - Node 3: [0, 5, 6]
   - Node 4: [1, 5, 6]
   - Node 5: [0, 3, 4, 6]
   - Node 6: [3, 4, 5]
   - Node 7: [0, 1]
   - Node 8: [2]
   - Node 9: [1]

2. Next, let's find the triangles by checking for nodes that have mutual edges:
   - Triangles involving Node 0: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 7>
   - Triangles involving Node 1: No triangles
   - Triangles involving Node 2: No triangles
   - Triangles involving Node 3: <0, 3, 5>
   - Triangles involving Node 4: No triangles
   - Triangles involving Node 5: <0, 3, 5>
   - Triangles involving Node 6: No triangles
   - Triangles involving Node 7: No triangles
   - Triangles involving Node 8: No triangles
   - Triangles involving Node 9: No triangles

3. Counting the total number of unique triangles: 
   - Total number of triangles = 2

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
