Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges given. 

Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Look for triangles involving node 0:
   - (0, 3), (3, 5), (5, 0)
   - Triangle <0, 3, 5> found.

2. Look for triangles involving node 1:
   - No triangles can be formed with node 1.

3. Look for triangles involving node 2:
   - No triangles can be formed with node 2.

4. Look for triangles involving node 3:
   - (3, 0), (0, 5), (5, 3)
   - Triangle <0, 3, 5> found.

5. Look for triangles involving node 4:
   - No triangles can be formed with node 4.

6. Look for triangles involving node 5:
   - No new triangles can be formed with node 5.

7. Look for triangles involving node 6:
   - No new triangles can be formed with node 6.

8. Look for triangles involving node 7:
   - No new triangles can be formed with node 7.

9. Look for triangles involving node 8:
   - No new triangles can be formed with node 8.

10. Look for triangles involving node 9:
   - No new triangles can be formed with node 9.

Now, count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
[2] <0, 3, 5>
