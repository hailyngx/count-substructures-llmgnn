Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can start by examining each possible triangle and checking if all three edges exist in the graph.

Let's list the possible triangles based on the given edges:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <0, 3, 4>
5. <0, 5, 9>
6. <1, 6, 8>
7. <2, 4, 5>
8. <2, 6, 8>
9. <2, 6, 9>
10. <2, 8, 9>
11. <3, 4, 5>
12. <5, 6, 9>
13. <6, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles by listing them:
[<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>]

The total number of triangles in the given graph is: [13]
