Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can count the number of triangles by examining each possible set of 3 nodes and checking if there are edges connecting all three nodes.

There are 3 unique triangles in this graph:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
