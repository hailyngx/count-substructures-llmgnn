Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. This can be quite time-consuming, so let's go through a systematic approach.

1. Identify triangles:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9. This forms a triangle <0, 6, 7>.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 8. No triangles are formed.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 6. This forms a triangle <2, 4, 6>.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8. No triangles are formed.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 9. No triangles are formed.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 9. No triangles are formed.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 8. This forms a triangle <6, 7, 8>.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6. No triangles are formed.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9. No triangles are formed.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8. No triangles are formed.

2. Count the total number of triangles: [3]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 3.
