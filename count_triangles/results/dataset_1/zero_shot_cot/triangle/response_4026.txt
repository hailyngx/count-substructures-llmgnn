Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle by having edges between all three nodes.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 9>
<3, 2, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is **[6]**.
