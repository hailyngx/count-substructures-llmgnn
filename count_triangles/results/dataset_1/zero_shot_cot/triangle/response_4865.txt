Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique combinations of three nodes that form triangles.

Looking at the graph, we can break it down node by node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <2, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
