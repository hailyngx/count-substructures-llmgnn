Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles through node connections:

1. Triangle formed by nodes (0, 5, 9)
2. Triangle formed by nodes (3, 8, 9)
3. Triangle formed by nodes (7, 8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
