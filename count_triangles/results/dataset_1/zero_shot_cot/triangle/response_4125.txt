Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes connected by edges.

The total number of triangles in this graph is [6]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
