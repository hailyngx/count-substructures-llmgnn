Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

We will look for triangles by checking each unique set of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other in the graph.

The triangles found in the given graph are:
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
