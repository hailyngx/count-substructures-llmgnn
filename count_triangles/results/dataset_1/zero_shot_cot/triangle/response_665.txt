Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the connected nodes.

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 5, 6>
3. <1, 8, 9>
4. <2, 4, 8>
5. <4, 7, 9>

There are 5 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
