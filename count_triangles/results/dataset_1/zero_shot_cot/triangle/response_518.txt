Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, let's determine the number of triangles and list the unique triangles.

Number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 4>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<8, 9, 2>
