Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, so triangle <0, 3, x> exists where x is either 1 or 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7, so triangle <1, 3, 7> exists.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8, so triangle <2, 6, 7> exists.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8, so triangle <3, 0, 1> exists.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, so triangle <4, 6, x> exists where x is either 2 or 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 7 and 9, so triangle <5, 7, 9> exists.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9, so triangle <6, 2, 9> exists.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8, so triangle <7, 1, 2> exists.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7, so triangle <8, 2, 3> exists.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6, so triangle <9, 5, 6> exists.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
