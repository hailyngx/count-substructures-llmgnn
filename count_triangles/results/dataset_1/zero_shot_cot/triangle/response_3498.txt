Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for triplets of nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 8>

There are 4 triangles in total. So, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
