Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to 0: {2, 4}
2. Nodes connected to 2: {0, 4, 5, 6}
3. Nodes connected to 3: {6, 8}
4. Nodes connected to 4: {0, 2, 9}
5. Nodes connected to 5: {2}
6. Nodes connected to 6: {2, 3, 7, 9}
7. Nodes connected to 7: {6, 8}
8. Nodes connected to 8: {3, 7}
9. Nodes connected to 9: {4, 6}

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle 4: <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle 5: <6, 7, 8>

Counting the total triangles, we get [5].
