Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Let's proceed step by step:

1. We will first list all the triangles found in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 9>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 7, 8>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 8, 9>
   - Triangle 5: <1, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 6: <3, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 7: <5, 7, 8>
   - Triangle 8: <7, 8, 9>

2. Now, we will count the total number of unique triangles: [8]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
