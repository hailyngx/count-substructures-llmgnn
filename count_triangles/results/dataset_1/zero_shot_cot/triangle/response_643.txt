Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's check each possible triangle:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
6. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 9>

Counting the unique triangles, we have found a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
