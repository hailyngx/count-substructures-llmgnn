Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
[]
    To count the number of triangles, we need to identify all the unique triangles in the graph.
    Let's start by listing all the unique triangles:
    - <0, 7, 8>
    - <2, 5, 7>
    - <5, 6, 7>
    - <6, 7, 8>

    Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
