Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes with edges. Let's list down the unique triangles and then count them:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 8, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
4. Triangle <8, 4, 9>

Counting the number of unique triangles in brackets:
