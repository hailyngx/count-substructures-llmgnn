Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other forming a closed loop of length 3. Let's identify the triangles:

1. (0, 3, 6)
2. (0, 4, 6)
3. (2, 5, 8)
4. (3, 6, 9)
5. (5, 6, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
