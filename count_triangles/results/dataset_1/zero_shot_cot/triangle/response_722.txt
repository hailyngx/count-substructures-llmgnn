Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in this graph by checking all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges.

1. Possible triangles involving node 0:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 5, 7>

2. Possible triangles involving node 1:
- No triangles involving node 1 since it only connects to node 0.

3. Possible triangles involving node 2:
- No triangles involving node 2 since it only connects to node 9.

4. Possible triangles involving node 3:
- No triangles involving node 3 due to its limited connections.

5. Possible triangles involving node 4:
- No triangles involving node 4 since it only connects to nodes 7 and 9.

6. Possible triangles involving node 5:
- No triangles involving node 5 due to its limited connections.

7. Possible triangles involving node 7:
- <0, 7, 4>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 7, 8>
Note: The triangle <0, 7, 8> was listed twice by mistake.

8. Possible triangles involving node 8:
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 7, 8>
Note: The triangle <0, 7, 8> was listed twice by mistake.

9. Possible triangles involving node 9:
- No triangles involving node 9 due to its limited connections.

Hence, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
