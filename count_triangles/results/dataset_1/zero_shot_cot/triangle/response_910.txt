Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are: <1, 3, 4>, <3, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.
