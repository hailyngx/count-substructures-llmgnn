Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 6, 1>
- <0, 6, 4>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
