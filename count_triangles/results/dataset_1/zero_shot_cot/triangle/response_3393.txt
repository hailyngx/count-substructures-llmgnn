Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9.
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5.
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5.
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.

Let's now calculate the total number of triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other forming a closed loop.

Looking at the connections, we can list the triangles as follows:
1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 5, 6>
3. <1, 5, 8>
4. <2, 5, 9>
5. <2, 5, 7>
6. <5, 6, 4>
7. <5, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
