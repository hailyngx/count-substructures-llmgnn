Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Since we have 10 nodes in the graph, we can start by listing out the triangles:

1. Triangles with node 0:
   - (0, 1, 9)
   - (0, 3, 7)
  
2. Triangles with node 1:
   - (1, 4, 5)

3. Triangles with node 2:
   - None

4. Triangles with node 3:
   - (3, 7, 9)

5. Triangles with node 4:
   - None

6. Triangles with node 5:
   - None

7. Triangles with node 6:
   - None

8. Triangles with node 7:
   - None

9. Triangles with node 8:
   - None

10. Triangles with node 9:
   - (9, 0, 3)
   - (9, 8, 4)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found in this graph are <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, and <1, 4, 5>.
