Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Looking at the edges (0, 2), (0, 3), and (2, 3), we find the triangle <0, 2, 3>.
2. Next, we consider the edges (1, 2), (1, 6), and (2, 6), which form the triangle <1, 2, 6>.
3. Moving on, edges (2, 0), (2, 1), and (0, 1) give us the triangle <0, 1, 2>.
4. Then, the edges (2, 3), (2, 9), and (3, 9) form the triangle <2, 3, 9>.
5. Considering edges (3, 0), (3, 5), and (0, 5) gives the triangle <0, 3, 5>.
6. Moving forward, edges (3, 5), (3, 6), and (5, 6) create the triangle <3, 5, 6>.
7. For the edges (5, 6), (5, 7), and (6, 7), we get the triangle <5, 6, 7>.
8. Examining the edges (5, 8), (5, 9), and (8, 9) provides the triangle <5, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
