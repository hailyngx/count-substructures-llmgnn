Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
By examining the given graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we can identify the triangles present. Here is a list of unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 6, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 9, 6>
<6, 8, 7>
<8, 7, 4>
<9, 6, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
