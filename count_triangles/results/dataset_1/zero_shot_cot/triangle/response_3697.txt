Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 2, 6)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 3, 6)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 6, 8)
4. Triangle 4: (1, 6, 9)
5. Triangle 5: (1, 8, 9)
6. Triangle 6: (2, 5, 6)
7. Triangle 7: (3, 4, 8)
8. Triangle 8: (4, 5, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 8 [8].
