Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5.

Let's count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 3: <1, 0, 5>
- Triangle 4: <1, 5, 9>
- Triangle 5: <4, 1, 5>
- Triangle 6: <4, 2, 9> 
- Triangle 7: <5, 0, 1>
- Triangle 8: <5, 0, 9>
- Triangle 9: <5, 1, 4>
- Triangle 10: <5, 7, 8>
- Triangle 11: <5, 7, 4>
- Triangle 12: <5, 9, 0>
- Triangle 13: <5, 9, 2>
- Triangle 14: <5, 9, 3>
- Triangle 15: <7, 5, 0>
- Triangle 16: <7, 5, 1>
- Triangle 17: <7, 5, 8>
- Triangle 18: <7, 4, 1>
- Triangle 19: <7, 4, 2>
- Triangle 20: <7, 4, 5>
- Triangle 21: <7, 8, 5>
- Triangle 22: <8, 7, 5>
- Triangle 23: <9, 5, 0>
- Triangle 24: <9, 5, 1>
- Triangle 25: <9, 0, 1>
- Triangle 26: <9, 5, 7>
- Triangle 27: <9, 5, 2>
- Triangle 28: <9, 5, 3>

Therefore, there are a total of [28] triangles in the graph.
