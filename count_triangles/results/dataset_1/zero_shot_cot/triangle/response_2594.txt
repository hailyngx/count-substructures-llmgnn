Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Write down all the triangles in the graph to count the total number of triangles accurately.

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9 with the following connections:
0: [1, 6]
1: [0, 2, 6]
2: [1, 3]
3: [2, 5, 6]
4: [9]
5: [3, 7]
6: [1, 3, 8]
7: [5, 8]
8: [6, 7]
9: [4]

Step 2: Count the triangles in the graph:

Triangles: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 4]
