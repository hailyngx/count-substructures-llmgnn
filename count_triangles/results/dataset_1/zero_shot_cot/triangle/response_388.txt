Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <2, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 6, 4>
5. Triangle <5, 0, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
