Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique combinations of 3 nodes that are connected to each other. Let's list down the triangles first:

1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <2, 3, 4>
5. <2, 5, 7>
6. <3, 4, 5>
7. <4, 5, 9>
8. <5, 6, 7>
9. <5, 6, 8>
10. <5, 7, 8>

There are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [10].
