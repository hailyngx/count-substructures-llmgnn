Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles identified in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <1, 2, 7>
5. <1, 6, 8>
6. <2, 5, 7>
7. <3, 5, 8>
8. <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
