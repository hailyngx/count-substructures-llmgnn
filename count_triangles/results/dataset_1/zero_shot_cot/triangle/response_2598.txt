Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
I will help you count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step.

1. Let's list all triangles present in the graph by checking all possible combinations of three nodes that form a triangle:
   - Possible triangles: <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <4, 3, 6>, <4, 3, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>
   
2. Count the total number of unique triangles listed above:
   - Total number of triangles: [11]
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 11.
