Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:
1. Triangle with nodes (0, 4, 5)
2. Triangle with nodes (0, 1, 4)
3. Triangle with nodes (0, 1, 5)
4. Triangle with nodes (3, 4, 5)
5. Triangle with nodes (3, 8, 4)
6. Triangle with nodes (3, 8, 5)

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 8, 4>
<3, 8, 5>
