Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected with edges.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. (0, 3, 7)
2. (0, 3, 9)
3. (0, 6, 2)
4. (0, 6, 7)
5. (0, 7, 9)
6. (2, 9, 3)
7. (3, 7, 5)
8. (4, 5, 7)
9. (9, 7, 3)

Next, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph.
