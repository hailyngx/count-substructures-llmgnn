Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we first examine each possible triangle formed by three nodes connected to each other.

Next, we identify the triangles one by one:
1. (1, 2, 4)
2. (1, 6, 7)
3. (1, 6, 8)
4. (1, 7, 8)

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in total. The unique triangles found in this graph are <1, 2, 4>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, and <1, 7, 8>.
