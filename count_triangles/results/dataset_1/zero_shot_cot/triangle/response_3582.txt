Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given graph consists of the following edges:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 1
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 0, 3, 4
- Node 2 is connected to Node 8
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1, 7
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 6
- Node 5 is connected to Node 6
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 4, 5, 9
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 3, 9
- Node 8 is connected to Node 2
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 6, 7

To count the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all the triangles where each node is connected to the other two nodes. Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangles involving Node 0:
   - No triangles involving Node 0.

2. Triangles involving Node 1:
   - <1, 3, 4>

3. Triangles involving Node 2:
   - No triangles involving Node 2.

4. Triangles involving Node 3:
   - <1, 3, 7>

5. Triangles involving Node 4:
   - No other triangles involving Node 4.

6. Triangles involving Node 5:
   - No triangles involving Node 5.

7. Triangles involving Node 6:
   - <4, 6, 9>
   - <6, 7, 9>

8. Triangles involving Node 7:
   - No other triangles involving Node 7.

9. Triangles involving Node 8:
   - No triangles involving Node 8.

10. Triangles involving Node 9:
   - No other triangles involving Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 4>, <4, 6, 9>, and <6, 7, 9>.
