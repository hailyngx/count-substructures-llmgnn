Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that form a closed loop of edges. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <0, 8, 9>
5. <1, 2, 4>
6. <1, 2, 9>
7. <1, 5, 9>
8. <1, 8, 9>
9. <2, 3, 5>
10. <2, 3, 9>
11. <2, 5, 9>
12. <5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [12]
