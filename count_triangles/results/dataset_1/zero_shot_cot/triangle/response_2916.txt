Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique triangles in the graph based on the given edges. Let's list all the triangles and then count them.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <4, 7, 8>
7. <5, 6, 7>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [7]
