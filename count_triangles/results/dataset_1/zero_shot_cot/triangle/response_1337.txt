Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected with each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in total in the given graph.
