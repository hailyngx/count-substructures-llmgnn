Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to node 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.

Now, let's identify the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 8, 4>
4. Triangle <1, 7, 2>
5. Triangle <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
