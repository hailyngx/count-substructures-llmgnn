Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <1, 2, 4>
3. <1, 3, 6>
4. <2, 4, 1>
5. <3, 6, 8>
6. <8, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in total.
