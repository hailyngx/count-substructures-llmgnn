Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can count the number of triangles present by looking for nodes that are connected in a triangular manner. 

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected with nodes 1, 2, and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected with nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected with nodes 0 and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected with nodes 1 and 4.
5. Node 4 is connected with nodes 3, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected with nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected with nodes 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected with nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected with nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected with node 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 2: <1, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
