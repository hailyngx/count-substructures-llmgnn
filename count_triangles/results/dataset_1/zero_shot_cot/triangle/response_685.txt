Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the possible triangles that can be formed in this graph:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 1, 6>
4. <0, 5, 3>
5. <0, 7, 4>
6. <1, 6, 2>
7. <2, 6, 3>
8. <2, 9, 4>
9. <3, 5, 9>
10. <4, 7, 0>
11. <4, 9, 5>
12. <4, 9, 6>
13. <5, 9, 6>
14. <9, 8, 4>
15. <9, 5, 0>
16. <9, 8, 2>
17. <9, 6, 1>
18. <9, 6, 2>
19. <9, 6, 3>
20. <9, 5, 3>

Therefore, there are a total of [20] triangles in the given graph.
