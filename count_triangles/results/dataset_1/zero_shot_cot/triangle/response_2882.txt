Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the triangles in the given graph:
1. (0, 2, 1)
2. (0, 2, 4)
3. (0, 2, 9)
4. (1, 2, 3)
5. (2, 3, 4)
6. (2, 3, 7)
7. (3, 6, 7)
8. (4, 7, 9)
9. (7, 9, 0)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [9]
