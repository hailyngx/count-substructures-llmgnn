Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:
  
  - Node 0: Connected to nodes 8 and 9.
    - <0, 8, 9> is a triangle.
    
  - Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9.
    - <1, 2, 9> is a triangle.
    
  - Node 2: Connected to nodes 1 and 9.
  
  - Node 3: Connected to nodes 5 and 6.
  
  - Node 4: Connected to nodes 1 and 5.
  
  - Node 5: Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
    - <3, 5, 7> is a triangle.
  
  - Node 6: Connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
  
  - Node 7: Connected to nodes 5 and 9.
  
  - Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9.
    - <0, 8, 9> is a triangle.
    - <6, 8, 9> is a triangle.
  
  - Node 9: Connected to all other nodes except 3.
    - <6, 8, 9> is a triangle.
    - <7, 8, 9> is a triangle.
  
  Total number of triangles: **[5]**
