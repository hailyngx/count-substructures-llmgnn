Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 1, 2)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 3, 5)
3. Triangle 3: (0, 5, 3)
4. Triangle 4: (0, 1, 6)
5. Triangle 5: (0, 2, 7)
6. Triangle 6: (0, 6, 5)
7. Triangle 7: (2, 3, 7)
8. Triangle 8: (4, 8, 9)
9. Triangle 9: (4, 9, 7)
10. Triangle 10: (7, 9, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10]. Unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 9, 7>, <7, 9, 8>.
