Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph:
Step 1: Identify all the triangles in the graph.
Step 2: List the unique triangles found.

After analyzing the given edges, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
1. <2, 7, 9>
2. <3, 6, 4>
3. <3, 6, 9>
4. <4, 6, 7>
5. <7, 9, 2>
6. <8, 3, 6>
7. <9, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
