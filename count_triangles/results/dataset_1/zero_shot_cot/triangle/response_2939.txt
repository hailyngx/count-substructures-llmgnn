Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the steps to find the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Identify all triangles formed by selecting 3 nodes that are connected to each other:
   - <0, 2, 3>
   - <0, 2, 8>
   - <0, 3, 8>
   - <3, 4, 5>
   - <3, 5, 9>
   - <3, 7, 8>
   - <5, 7, 9>   

2. Calculate the total number of triangles found in the graph:
   - Total number of triangles: [7]
