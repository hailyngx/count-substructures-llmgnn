Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Firstly, identify all the triangles in the graph:
   - Possible triangles involving node 0: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 1: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 2: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 3: <0, 1, 3>
   - Possible triangles involving node 4: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 5: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 6: <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 9>
   - Possible triangles involving node 7: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 8: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 9: None

2. List the unique triangles found:
   - <0, 1, 3>
   - <2, 6, 9>
   - <3, 6, 9>

3. Finally, output the total number of triangles inside brackets:
