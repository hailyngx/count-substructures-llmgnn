Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles formed by looking for nodes that have edges between each other.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
