Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list out the triangles we can find in this graph:

1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <1, 3, 4>
5. <1, 3, 7>
6. <1, 4, 7>
7. <3, 5, 7>
8. <3, 5, 8>
9. <3, 6, 8>
10. <4, 3, 7>
11. <5, 6, 8>
12. <5, 6, 7>
13. <6, 8, 7>

So, there are a total of 13 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the output will be [13].
