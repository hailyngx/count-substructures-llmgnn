Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated by finding all possible triangles using the given graph. Here is the solution step-by-step:

1. Node pairs that have 2 edges between them:
- (0, 1), (1, 0): <0, 1>.
- (0, 5), (5, 0): <0, 5>.
- (0, 9), (9, 0): <0, 9>.
- (1, 5), (5, 1): <1, 5>.
- (3, 4), (4, 3): <3, 4>.
- (3, 8), (8, 3): <3, 8>.
- (3, 9), (9, 3): <3, 9>.
- (4, 5), (5, 4): <4, 5>.
- (5, 8), (8, 5): <5, 8>.

2. Unique triangles formed by the above node pairs:
- <0, 1, 5>.
- <0, 3, 9>.
- <1, 3, 8>.
- <4, 5, 8>.

Count of unique triangles: [4]
