Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will list out the unique triangles found.

1. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 4>
5. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <1, 2, 8>
7. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
8. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
9. Triangle <4, 6, 9>
10. Triangle <8, 9, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
