Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by three nodes.

Let's start by listing all the unique triangles:
1. <1, 4, 8>
2. <2, 0, 4>
3. <3, 6, 9>
4. <6, 7, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. We have [4] triangles in total.
