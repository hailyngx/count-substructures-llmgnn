Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle involving nodes 1, 5, and 7: <1, 5, 7>
2. Triangle involving nodes 1, 5, and 9: <1, 5, 9>

Count of triangles: [2]
