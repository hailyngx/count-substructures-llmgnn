Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. Each triangle consists of three nodes that are all connected with each other.

In this case, the total number of triangles is 4, and they are:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
