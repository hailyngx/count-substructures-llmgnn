Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles in this graph:

1. Identify nodes that, when connected, form triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes (0, 3, 9)
- Triangle 2: Nodes (2, 4, 6)
- Triangle 3: Nodes (4, 7, 9)

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found inside <> are: <0, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 7, 9>.
