Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle 3: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 4: <1, 2, 4>
- Triangle 5: <1, 4, 8>

Counting the total number of triangles, we get 5 triangles in total:
