Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that form triangles. A triangle occurs when three nodes are mutually connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Possible triangles involving Node 0: 
   - <0, 5, 8>
   - <0, 6, 2>
   - <0, 8, 5>
   
2. Possible triangles involving Node 1:
   - No triangles involving Node 1.

3. Possible triangles involving Node 2:
   - <2, 6, 0>
   
4. Possible triangles involving Node 3:
   - <3, 1, 7>
   - <3, 6, 0>
   - <3, 6, 9>
   - <3, 8, 5>
   - <3, 9, 2>
   - <3, 9, 5>

5. Possible triangles involving Node 4:
   - No triangles involving Node 4.

6. Possible triangles involving Node 5:
   - <5, 0, 8>
   - <5, 6, 9>
   - <5, 8, 0>
   
7. Possible triangles involving Node 6:
   - <6, 0, 2>
   - <6, 2, 9>
   - <6, 3, 9>
   - <6, 4, 0>

8. Possible triangles involving Node 7:
   - No triangles involving Node 7.

9. Possible triangles involving Node 8:
   - <8, 0, 5>
   - <8, 2, 9>
   - <8, 3, 5>

10. Possible triangles involving Node 9:
   - <9, 2, 3>
   - <9, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
