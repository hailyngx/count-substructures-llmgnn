Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's analyze the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <3, 1, 5>
5. Triangle <5, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [5]
