Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Looking at node 0:
    - Node 0 is not part of any edge with two other nodes, so it cannot form a triangle.

2. Looking at node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7.
    - Among these connections, we find the triangle <1, 3, 4>.

3. Looking at node 2:
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
    - There are no triangles involving node 2.

4. Looking at node 3:
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
    - There are no triangles involving node 3.

5. Looking at node 4:
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9.
    - Among these connections, we find another triangle <1, 4, 9>.

6. Looking at node 6:
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
    - There are no triangles involving node 6.

7. Looking at node 7:
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, and 9.
    - There are no triangles involving node 7.

8. Looking at node 8:
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
    - There are no triangles involving node 8.

9. Looking at node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 7.
    - There are no additional triangles involving node 9.

After examining all nodes, we found two unique triangles: <1, 3, 4> and <1, 4, 9>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
