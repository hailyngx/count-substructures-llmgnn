Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze each set of three nodes and determine if they form a triangle by checking if each pair of nodes is connected by an edge.

By observing the given edges, we can find the following triangles:
1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <0, 5, 4>
5. <1, 2, 6>
6. <5, 4, 6>
7. <5, 6, 7>
8. <6, 5, 7>
9. <6, 5, 4>
10. <6, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
