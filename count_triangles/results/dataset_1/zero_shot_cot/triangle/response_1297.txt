Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 1, 2>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 3>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 8, 4>
<2, 1, 5>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 8, 1>
<7, 1, 3>
<7, 1, 9>
<8, 1, 5>
<9, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
