Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first identify all the triangles using the given edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected.

Let's list all the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 4, 1>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <1, 8, 4>
5. <1, 6, 8>
6. <2, 0, 4>
7. <2, 4, 7>
8. <3, 1, 8>
9. <3, 7, 4>
10. <6, 9, 2>
11. <6, 9, 7>
12. <6, 1, 4>
13. <7, 6, 1>
14. <8, 5, 0>
15. <8, 6, 1>
16. <8, 6, 3>
17. <8, 3, 7>
18. <8, 3, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
