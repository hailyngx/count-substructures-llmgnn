Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Here are the triangles present in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 3, 7>
4. <0, 3, 8>
5. <1, 2, 7>
6. <1, 6, 5>
7. <3, 5, 7>
8. <3, 5, 6>
9. <3, 6, 7>
10. <3, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
