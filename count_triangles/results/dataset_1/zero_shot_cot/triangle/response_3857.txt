Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Possible triangles involving node 0: <0, 2, 4> and <0, 4, 5>
2. Possible triangles involving node 1: None
3. Possible triangles involving node 2: <2, 0, 4> and <2, 4, 5>
4. Possible triangles involving node 3: None
5. Possible triangles involving node 4: <4, 0, 2> and <4, 2, 5>
6. Possible triangles involving node 5: <5, 0, 2> and <5, 2, 4>
7. Possible triangles involving node 6: None
8. Possible triangles involving node 7: None
9. Possible triangles involving node 8: None
10. Possible triangles involving node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
