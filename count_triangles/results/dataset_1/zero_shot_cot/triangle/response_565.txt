Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we will count the number of triangles by examining all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

The nodes given in the graph are from 0 to 9 and the edges are provided. Let's list the triangles step by step:

1. Nodes 0, 7, and 9 form a triangle: <0, 7, 9>.
2. Nodes 2, 3, and 9 form a triangle: <2, 3, 9>.
3. Nodes 2, 4, and 9 form a triangle: <2, 4, 9>.
4. Nodes 3, 6, and 9 form a triangle: <3, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
