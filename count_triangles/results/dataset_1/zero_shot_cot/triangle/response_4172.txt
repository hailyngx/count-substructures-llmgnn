Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check all possible combinations of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Let's go step by step:
1. Node 0 has connections with nodes 3, 6, and 7.
2. Node 1 has connections with nodes 5, 7, and 9.
3. Node 3 has connections with nodes 0, 6, and 7.
4. Node 4 has connections with nodes 5, 8, and 9.
5. Node 5 has connections with nodes 1, 4, and 9.
6. Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 3, and 8.
7. Node 7 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 3.
8. Node 8 has connections with nodes 4, 6, and 7.
9. Node 9 has connections with nodes 1, 4, and 5.

Now, let's list the unique triangles:
1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 5, 9>
5. <4, 5, 9>

There are 5 triangles in total. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
