Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangular relationships in this graph can be determined by finding nodes that form closed loops of length 3. Here, we need to count the number of triangles and list them uniquely.

There are three triangles in this graph:
1. <0, 6, 8>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <0, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
