Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by looking at each combination of three nodes and checking if they form a triangle. 

Going through all the possible triangles:
1. Triangle 1: (0, 1, 4)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 1, 8)
3. Triangle 3: (0, 4, 8)
4. Triangle 4: (1, 4, 9)
5. Triangle 5: (2, 4, 9)
6. Triangle 6: (2, 3, 9)
7. Triangle 7: (3, 4, 7)
8. Triangle 8: (3, 4, 9)
9. Triangle 9: (5, 8, 9)
10. Triangle 10: (5, 2, 9)
11. Triangle 11: (7, 9, 4)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 2, 9>, and <7, 9, 4>.
