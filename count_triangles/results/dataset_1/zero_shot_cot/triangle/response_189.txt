Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's list all the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 3>
3. <1, 0, 4>
4. <1, 6, 4>
5. <2, 0, 4>
6. <2, 3, 4>
7. <3, 6, 8>
8. <3, 6, 9>
9. <4, 1, 7>
10. <4, 2, 7>
11. <6, 5, 7>
12. <6, 7, 8>
13. <6, 8, 9>
14. <6, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
