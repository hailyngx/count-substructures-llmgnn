Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.
2. Scan through each node and check if there exist two edges between any two nodes. If such edges exist, then there is a triangle formed by those three nodes.
3. List down all the unique triangles.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 9, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 8, 4>
<7, 5, 9>
[6 unique triangles found]
