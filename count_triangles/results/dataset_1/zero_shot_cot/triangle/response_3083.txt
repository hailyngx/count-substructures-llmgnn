Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's list all possible triangles based on the given edges:

1. (0, 2, 5)
2. (0, 3, 4)
3. (0, 4, 5)
4. (1, 7, 9)
5. (4, 7, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
