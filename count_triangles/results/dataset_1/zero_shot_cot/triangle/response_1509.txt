Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's examine each possible triangle:

1. Triangle with nodes 0, 2, and 4: <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle with nodes 0, 2, and 6: <0, 2, 6>
3. Triangle with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <1, 2, 5>
4. Triangle with nodes 1, 5, and 9: <1, 5, 9>
5. Triangle with nodes 2, 5, and 3: <2, 5, 3>
6. Triangle with nodes 3, 5, and 8: <3, 5, 8>
7. Triangle with nodes 3, 5, and 9: <3, 5, 9>
8. Triangle with nodes 3, 7, and 6: <3, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
