Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in a graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can identify the triangles by examining each possible combination of three nodes.

The unique triangles in this graph are:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [3]
