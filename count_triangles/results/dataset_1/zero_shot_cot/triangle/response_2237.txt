Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes (0, 2, 5)
- Triangle 2: Nodes (0, 3, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5> and <0, 3, 9>.
