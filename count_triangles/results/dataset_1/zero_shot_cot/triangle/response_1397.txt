Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list down the triangles present in the given graph:
1. (1, 3, 2)
2. (1, 3, 7)
3. (2, 3, 7)
4. (7, 1, 3)
5. (7, 1, 8)
6. (7, 2, 8)
7. (3, 2, 8)
8. (1, 7, 8)
9. (3, 2, 8)
10. (7, 8, 2)

Now, we count the total number of unique triangles:
