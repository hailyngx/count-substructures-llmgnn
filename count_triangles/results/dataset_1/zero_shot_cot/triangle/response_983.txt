Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 0.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles by looking at each possible combination of three interconnected nodes:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <2, 5, 7>

Based on the edges provided, these are the only two triangles we can find in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
