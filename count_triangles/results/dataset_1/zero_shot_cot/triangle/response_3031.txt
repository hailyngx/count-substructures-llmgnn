Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first identify the triangles present and then count the total number of such triangles.

From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
3. Triangle <6, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the provided graph.
