Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all triangles by examining each node pair:
Triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 4>
Triangles involving node 1: None
Triangles involving node 2: None
Triangles involving node 3: None
Triangles involving node 4: None
Triangles involving node 5: None
Triangles involving node 6: None
Triangles involving node 7: None
Triangles involving node 8: None
Triangles involving node 9: None

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles and output them:
Total number of triangles: [2]
