Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's determine the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step. 

Step 1: Identify triangles in the graph -
- A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in a closed loop. 
- We will check each possible combination of 3 nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Step 2: List the triangles -
1. <2, 4, 7>
2. <2, 5, 9>
3. <4, 5, 7>
4. <4, 7, 9>
5. <5, 7, 9>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique triangles found -
There are 5 unique triangles in total.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
