Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify sets of nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Considering the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can identify the triangles and then count them. Please find the list of unique triangles below:

1. <0, 7, 8>
2. <1, 5, 7>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
