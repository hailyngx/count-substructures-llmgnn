Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all triangles formed by the edges connecting the nodes. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <1, 5, 8>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <2, 5, 8>
4. <3, 6, 9>
5. <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
