Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, we can identify the triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Nodes 0, 1, 3 form a triangle: <0, 1, 3>
2. Nodes 1, 3, 7 form a triangle: <1, 3, 7>
3. Nodes 1, 4, 5 form a triangle: <1, 4, 5>
4. Nodes 3, 7, 5 form a triangle: <3, 5, 7>
5. Nodes 3, 8, 9 form a triangle: <3, 8, 9>
6. Nodes 4, 5, 7 form a triangle: <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
