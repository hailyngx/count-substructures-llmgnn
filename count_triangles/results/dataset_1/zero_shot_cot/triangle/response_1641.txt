Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all the triangles by checking each possible combination of three nodes connected by edges.
2. Count the number of unique triangles found.

Here are the unique triangles in the graph:
[<0, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 1>, <6, 7, 0>, <6, 7, 2>, <6, 8, 0>, <6, 8, 2>, <7, 9, 0>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
