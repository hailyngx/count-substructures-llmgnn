Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Check each combination of three nodes to see if they form a triangle:

- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 4)
- Triangle 2: (0, 3, 7)
- Triangle 3: (0, 4, 2)
- Triangle 4: (0, 9, 5)
- Triangle 5: (3, 1, 6)
- Triangle 6: (3, 5, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles present in the graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 9, 5>, <3, 1, 6>, <3, 5, 9>.
