Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that form a triangle. 

Let's start by listing the unique triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<8, 9, 1>
<8, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
