Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles by looking at each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <1, 4, 9>
4. <2, 4, 9>
5. <1, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
