Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three vertices that form a triangle.

Let's identify the triangles step by step:
1. Node 0 is connected to Node 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to Nodes 3, 4, 6, and 8.
3. Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1 and 8.
4. Node 4 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 9.
5. Node 5 is connected to Node 7.
6. Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to Nodes 4 and 5.
8. Node 8 is connected to Nodes 1 and 3.
9. Node 9 is connected to Nodes 4 and 6.

Let's count the triangles and list them:
1. <1, 4, 6>
2. <1, 4, 8>
3. <1, 6, 9>
4. <3, 1, 4>
5. <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
