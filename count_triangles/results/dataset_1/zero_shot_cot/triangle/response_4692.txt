Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that form a cycle of length 3.

The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 8, 9>

Count of triangles is [5].
