Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <4, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <7, 9, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
