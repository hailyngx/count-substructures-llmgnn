Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can determine the number of triangles by identifying the triangles formed by connecting every three nodes that are mutually connected. Let's go through the process step by step:

1. Node 0 is not part of any triangle.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, and 9.
    - Triangle <1, 2, 4>.
    - Triangle <1, 4, 7>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    - Triangle <4, 5, 7>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.

From the identified triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, and <1, 5, 7>.
