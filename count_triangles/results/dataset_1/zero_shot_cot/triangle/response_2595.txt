Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when there are three nodes connected by edges to each other.

Since listing all possible triangles would be a bit cumbersome, we can count them systematically.

Let's take each node at a time and see how many triangles it participates in:

1. Node 0: No triangles can be formed with node 0.
2. Node 1: Triangle with nodes 0, 1, and 6.
3. Node 2: No triangles can be formed with node 2.
4. Node 3: Triangle with nodes 1, 3, and 7.
5. Node 4: No triangles can be formed with node 4.
6. Node 5: No triangles can be formed with node 5.
7. Node 6: No new triangles can be formed with node 6.
8. Node 7: No new triangles can be formed with node 7.
9. Node 8: No triangles can be formed with node 8.
10. Node 9: No new triangles can be formed with node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6> and <1, 3, 7>.
