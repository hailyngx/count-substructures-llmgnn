Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the steps to find the triangles:

1. Identify the triangles by examining all possible combinations of three nodes.
2. Check if each combination forms a triangle by verifying if all pairwise connections exist.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Triangles:
   - <0, 1, 8>
   - <0, 2, 8>
   - <1, 2, 4>
   - <1, 4, 8>
   - <2, 4, 8>
   - <5, 6, 7>
   - <5, 6, 9>
   - <5, 7, 9>
   - <6, 7, 8>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles: [9]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
