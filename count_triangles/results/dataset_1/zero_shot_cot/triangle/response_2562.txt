Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are pairwise connected. Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:

<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
