Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected. Let's list the triangles first:

1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <1, 2, 6>
4. <0, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in this graph which is [4].
