Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected in a way that forms a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph:
