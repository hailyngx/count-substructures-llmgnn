Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Nodes involved in a triangle will have edges connecting all three nodes.
2. For example, if nodes A, B, and C form a triangle, then there should be edges connecting A-B, B-C, and A-C.

Now, let's find the triangles:
1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <2, 5, 9>
5. <4, 8, 9>

Hence, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the output is:
