Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. 

The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 8>.
