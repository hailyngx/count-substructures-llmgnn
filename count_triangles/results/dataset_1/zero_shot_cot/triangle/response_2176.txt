Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: 1, 4, 6, 9
   - Possible triangles: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 9), (0, 4, 6), (0, 4, 9), (0, 6, 9)
   - Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 6>

2. Nodes connected to node 1: 0, 2, 3
   - Possible triangles: (1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 3), (1, 2, 3)
   - Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <1, 2, 3>

3. Nodes connected to node 2: 1, 6, 7
   - Possible triangles: (2, 1, 6), (2, 1, 7), (2, 6, 7)
   - Unique triangles: <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 6, 7>

4. Nodes connected to node 3: 1, 4, 6
   - Possible triangles: (3, 1, 4), (3, 1, 6), (3, 4, 6)
   - Unique triangles: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 6>

5. Nodes connected to node 4: 0, 3
   - Possible triangle: (0, 3, 4)
   - Unique triangle: <0, 3, 4>

6. Nodes connected to node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7
   - Possible triangles: (6, 0, 2), (6, 0, 3), (6, 0, 7), (6, 2, 3), (6, 2, 7), (6, 3, 7)
   - Unique triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 7>

7. Nodes connected to node 7: 2, 6, 8
   - Possible triangles: (7, 2, 8), (7, 6, 8)
   - Unique triangles: <2, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>

8. Nodes connected to node 8: 5, 7
   - No triangle involving node 8.

9. Node connected to node 5: 8
   - No triangle involving node 5.

10. Node connected to node 9: 0
    - No triangle involving node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
