Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <3, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <5, 7, 9>

Counting the triangles, we find that there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
