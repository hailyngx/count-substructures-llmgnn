Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other (form a triangle). Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Identify all the triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <3, 4, 8>
- There are no other triangles in this graph.

2. Count the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 2

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
