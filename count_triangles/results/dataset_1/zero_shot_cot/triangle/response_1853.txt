Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. For each node, check all pairs of its neighbors to see if there is an edge between them, creating a triangle.
2. Keep track of all unique triangles found.

Number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles: <0, 2, 3>, <3, 4, 8>
