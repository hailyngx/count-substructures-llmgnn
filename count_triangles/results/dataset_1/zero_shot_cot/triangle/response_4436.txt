Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first examine all possible triangles formed by nodes connected by edges:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
4. Triangle <2, 1, 5>
5. Triangle <4, 1, 7>
6. Triangle <5, 1, 6>
7. Triangle <6, 5, 7>
8. Triangle <7, 4, 1>
9. Triangle <7, 6, 5>
10. Triangle <8, 0, 7>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. So, the output is:
[10]
