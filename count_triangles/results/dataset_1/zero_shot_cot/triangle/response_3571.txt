Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From node 0, we have edges to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
2. Node 2 has edges to nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
3. Node 4 has edges to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
4. Node 6 has edges to nodes 2 and 4.
5. Node 7 has edges to nodes 2 and 9.
6. Node 3 has an edge to node 5.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 8)
- Triangle 2: (0, 2, 9)
- Triangle 3: (2, 4, 6)
- Triangle 4: (2, 4, 9)
- Triangle 5: (2, 6, 4)
- Triangle 6: (2, 7, 9)

Thus, the total number of triangles is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 4>, and <2, 7, 9>.
