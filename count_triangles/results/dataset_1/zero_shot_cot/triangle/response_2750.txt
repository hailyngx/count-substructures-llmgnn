Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph:
Step 1: Identify all triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other forming a closed loop.
Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles.

After analyzing the provided graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
