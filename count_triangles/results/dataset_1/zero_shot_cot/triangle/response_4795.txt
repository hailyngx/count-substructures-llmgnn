Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles are: <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 8>.
