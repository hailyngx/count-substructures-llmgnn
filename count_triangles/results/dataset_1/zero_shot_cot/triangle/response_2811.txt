Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
From the given information, the graph consists of the following edges:
- (0, 5), (0, 9)
- (1, 3), (1, 5)
- (2, 6), (2, 9)
- (3, 1), (3, 4)
- (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9)
- (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8)
- (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7)
- (7, 6)
- (8, 5)
- (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 4)

To count the number of triangles:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to node 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.

Now, we will find the triangles by identifying nodes that form a triangle:
- Triangle 1: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 2: <4, 5, 6>
- Triangle 3: <5, 6, 7>

Count of triangles: [3]
