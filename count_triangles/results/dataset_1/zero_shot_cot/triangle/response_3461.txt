Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

First, let's go through the list of edges and identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (1, 2, 8)
- Triangle 2: (2, 3, 6)
- Triangle 3: (2, 8, 9)
- Triangle 4: (3, 5, 9)
- Triangle 5: (3, 6, 8)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [5]

The unique triangles are as follows:
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
