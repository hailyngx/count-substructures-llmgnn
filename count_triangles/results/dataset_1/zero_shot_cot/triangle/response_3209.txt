Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for nodes that form triangles by having edges between them. 

Let's list down the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
