Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a more structured form:

Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 9
Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 8
Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 4: Connected to nodes 3, 5
Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 7
Node 6: Connected to node 1
Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 5
Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3
Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 1

Now, let's identify the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 8>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
