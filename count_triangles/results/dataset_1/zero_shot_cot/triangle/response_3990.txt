Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle with nodes (0, 2, 4)
2. Triangle with nodes (0, 6, 7)
3. Triangle with nodes (1, 2, 6)
4. Triangle with nodes (4, 6, 9)
5. Triangle with nodes (0, 4, 6)
6. Triangle with nodes (0, 1, 7)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
