Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <2, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <2, 7, 3>
3. Triangle <2, 7, 4>
4. Triangle <2, 7, 5>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
