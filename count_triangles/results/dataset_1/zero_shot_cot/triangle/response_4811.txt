Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's calculate the total number of triangles step-by-step:

1. **Identifying Triangles**:
   - Triangles are formed by sets of three nodes connected to each other. 
   - We'll go through each node and check if there are two edges that connect them to form a triangle.

2. **Possible Triangles**:
   - From the given edges, we can list the possible triangles:
     - <0, 7, 6>
     - <0, 7, 8>
     - <0, 8, 4>
     - <1, 3, 6>
     - <1, 3, 9>
     - <4, 6, 8>
     - <9, 1, 5>

3. **Total Number of Triangles**:
   - The total number of triangles in this graph is [7].
