Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's denote the nodes as follows based on the given edges:
Node 1: {2, 4}
Node 2: {1, 7, 8}
Node 3: {5, 8, 9}
Node 4: {1}
Node 5: {3, 7}
Node 6: {8}
Node 7: {2, 5, 8}
Node 8: {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: {3, 8}

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 7>
2. Triangle <2, 7, 8>
3. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <3, 8, 9>
5. Triangle <8, 6, 7>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [5].
