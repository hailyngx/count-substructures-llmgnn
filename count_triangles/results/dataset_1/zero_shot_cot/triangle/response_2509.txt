Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by 3 nodes connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step.

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Possible triangles to check (with unique combinations): 
1. (0, 2, 1)
2. (0, 2, 3)
3. (0, 2, 9)
4. (0, 3, 6)
5. (0, 3, 9)
6. (1, 2, 7)
7. (1, 7, 2)
8. (2, 5, 6)
9. (2, 6, 7)
10. (4, 8, 6)
11. (4, 8, 9)
12. (6, 8, 9)

Counting the total number of triangles [<total>] found: [0]
