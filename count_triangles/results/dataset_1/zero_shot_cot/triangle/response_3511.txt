Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's count the number of triangles:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6.

There are 6 triangles in this graph.
The triangles are: 
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 1, 4>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 3, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in this graph.
