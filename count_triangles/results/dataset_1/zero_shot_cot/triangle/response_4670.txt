Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. From the given edges, we can create the following list of connections:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7
   - Node 2 is connected to node 7
   - Node 3 is connected to node 6
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 9
   - Node 5 is connected to node 9
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 9
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 9
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7

2. Now, let's analyze each potential triangle:
   - Triangle <1, 4, 9>
   - Triangle <1, 7, 9>
   - Triangle <4, 7, 9>

3. However, there are no other triangles formed with the given connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is **3** [3].
