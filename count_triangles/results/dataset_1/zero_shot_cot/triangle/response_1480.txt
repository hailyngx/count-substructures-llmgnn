Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.
The nodes in the graph are from 0 to 9.
The total number of triangles can be counted by checking each unique set of three nodes connected by edges. We will consider triangles <u, v, w> where there exist edges between (u, v), (v, w), and (w, u).

Let's find the triangles:

1. (0, 6, 8)
2. (0, 6, 9)
3. (0, 8, 9)
4. (1, 2, 9)
5. (2, 5, 7)
6. (2, 5, 9)
7. (3, 1, 9)
8. (5, 6, 7)
9. (5, 6, 9)
10. (5, 7, 9)
11. (6, 7, 9)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles:
There are total [11] triangles in the given graph.
