Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's tabulate the given edges in a convenient format:

    0: 5
    1: 2, 4, 6
    2: 1, 3, 9
    3: 2, 5, 9
    4: 1, 9
    5: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
    6: 1, 5, 7, 9
    7: 6, 8
    8: 5, 7, 9
    9: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Next, let's look for triangles by checking each set of three nodes for connections:

1. (0, 3, 5)
2. (1, 2, 9)
3. (1, 4, 9)
4. (1, 6, 9)
5. (2, 3, 9)
6. (5, 6, 9)
7. (5, 8, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph: <0, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>.
