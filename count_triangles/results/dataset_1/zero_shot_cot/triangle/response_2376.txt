Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected with each other. Let's start counting the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 8, 5>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <3, 1, 7>
6. Triangle <3, 2, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
8. Triangle <5, 4, 0>
9. Triangle <5, 4, 3>
10. Triangle <5, 9, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
