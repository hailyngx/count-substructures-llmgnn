Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node
```
Degree of Node 0: 5
Degree of Node 2: 3
Degree of Node 3: 4
Degree of Node 4: 2
Degree of Node 5: 5
Degree of Node 6: 3
Degree of Node 7: 2
Degree of Node 8: 3
Degree of Node 9: 5
```

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles
```
Triangles = 1/2 * Sum(degree of node i * (degree of node i - 1) * common neighbors between i and j) for all pairs (i, j) where i < j
```

Let's calculate the triangles:
- For Node 0: (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 5), (0, 4, 9), (0, 5, 6), (0, 5, 9), (0, 8, 9) --> Total 6 triangles
- For Node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 3, 8) --> Total 2 triangles
- For Node 3: (3, 0, 5), (3, 2, 8), (3, 5, 6) --> Total 3 triangles
- For Node 4: No triangles
- For Node 5: (5, 0, 3), (5, 3, 6), (5, 6, 9), (5, 7, 9), (5, 9, 7) --> Total 5 triangles
- For Node 6: (6, 3, 5), (6, 5, 9) --> Total 2 triangles
- For Node 7: No triangles
- For Node 8: No triangles
- For Node 9: (9, 4, 5), (9, 5, 6), (9, 5, 7), (9, 6, 7), (9, 6, 8) --> Total 5 triangles

Total number of triangles = 6 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 23
