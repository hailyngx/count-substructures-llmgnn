Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8.

Now, let's find the triangles:

- Triangle 1: <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle 2: <3, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [2].
