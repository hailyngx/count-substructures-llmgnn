Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
7. Triangle <4, 6, 8>
8. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
9. Triangle <4, 6, 5>
  
There are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
