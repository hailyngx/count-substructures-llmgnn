Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique triangles in the given graph. Hence, the total number of triangles is [3].

The unique triangles are as follows:
1. <1, 2, 8>
2. <2, 6, 7>
3. <7, 8, 9>
