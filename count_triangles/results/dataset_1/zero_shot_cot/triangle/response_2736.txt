Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Based on the given edges, the triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 7, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<7, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
