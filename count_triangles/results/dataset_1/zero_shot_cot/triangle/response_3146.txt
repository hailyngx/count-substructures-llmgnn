Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 6, 8>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <2, 3, 9>
5. <4, 8, 9>
6. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
