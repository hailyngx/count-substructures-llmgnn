Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify the triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <2, 0, 8>
2. <2, 1, 7>
3. <2, 6, 7>
4. <4, 1, 7>
5. <4, 3, 7>

Total number of triangles: [5]
