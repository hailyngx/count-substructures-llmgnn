Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

A triangle is formed when there are three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can start by examining each possible combination of three nodes from the given graph and checking if they form a triangle.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <1, 3, 8>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <2, 4, 5>
5. <3, 8, 4>
6. <3, 8, 9>
7. <4, 5, 2>
8. <5, 7, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
