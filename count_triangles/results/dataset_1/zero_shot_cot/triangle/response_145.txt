Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can search for all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges in such a way that each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Let's list down the triangles:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <1, 2, 5>
4. <1, 4, 5>
5. <1, 4, 9>
6. <1, 5, 0>
7. <2, 1, 4>
8. <4, 0, 5>
9. <7, 1, 4>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
