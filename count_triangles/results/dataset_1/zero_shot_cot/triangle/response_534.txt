Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: degree = 5
- Node 1: degree = 4
- Node 2: degree = 2
- Node 4: degree = 2
- Node 5: degree = 2
- Node 6: degree = 5
- Node 7: degree = 2
- Node 8: degree = 2
- Node 9: degree = 2

Step 2: Identify triangles by looking at each set of three nodes connected by edges.
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <6, 8, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of triangles and list them uniquely.
- Total number of triangles: [7]
