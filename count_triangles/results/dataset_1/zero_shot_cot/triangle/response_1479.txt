Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by connecting the nodes based on the given edges. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 1.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 6, 9>

Since each triangle may be listed in multiple ways due to its vertices, we have a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
