Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming triangles.

Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.

Now, let's list out the triangles:

1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <0, 4, 7>

Count of triangles: [2]
