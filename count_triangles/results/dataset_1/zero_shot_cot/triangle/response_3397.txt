Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in this graph. They are as follows:
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 7>
<5, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [3].
