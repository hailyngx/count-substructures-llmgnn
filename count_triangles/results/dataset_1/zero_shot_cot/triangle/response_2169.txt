Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify all possible triangles by looking for nodes that are connected in such a way that they form a closed triangle.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
