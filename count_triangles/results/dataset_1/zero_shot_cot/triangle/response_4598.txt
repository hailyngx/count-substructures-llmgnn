Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 4, 2>
3. <1, 6, 9>
4. <2, 4, 5>
5. <6, 7, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles, we have [5] triangles in total.
