Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to consider every set of 3 nodes that form a triangle. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
4. Node 5 is connected to node 3.
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
6. Node 8 is connected to node 3 and 4.
7. Node 9 is connected to node 3.

Now, let's list the triangles using the given connections:

1. <2, 3, 6>
2. <3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
