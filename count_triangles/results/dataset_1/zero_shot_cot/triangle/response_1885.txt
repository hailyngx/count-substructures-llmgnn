Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually adjacent. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes 0, 2, 7 form a triangle as they are mutually connected: <0, 2, 7>.
2. Nodes 0, 2, 8 form a triangle as they are mutually connected: <0, 2, 8>.
3. Nodes 1, 2, 4 form a triangle as they are mutually connected: <1, 2, 4>.
4. Nodes 1, 4, 7 form a triangle as they are mutually connected: <1, 4, 7>.
5. Nodes 2, 4, 7 form a triangle as they are mutually connected: <2, 4, 7>.
6. Nodes 2, 4, 6 form a triangle as they are mutually connected: <2, 4, 6>.
7. Nodes 4, 6, 9 form a triangle as they are mutually connected: <4, 6, 9>.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
