Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's start by listing the triangles:
1. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <4, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <5, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
