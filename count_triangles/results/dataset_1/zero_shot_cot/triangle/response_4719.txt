Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. We will look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 1>
<9, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
