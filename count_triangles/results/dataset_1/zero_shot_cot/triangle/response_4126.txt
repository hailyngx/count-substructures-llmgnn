Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Let's list out the unique triangles and then count them.

The unique triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
