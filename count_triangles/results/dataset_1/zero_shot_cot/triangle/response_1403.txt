Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Identify all triangles in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: (1, 5, 8)
   - Triangle 2: (2, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 3: (2, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 4: (8, 9, 3)

2. Count the total number of triangles: [4]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
