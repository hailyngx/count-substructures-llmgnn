Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph. We can use the fact that a triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. So, we need to look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two.

Now, let's list all the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <2, 3, 6>
6. <2, 3, 9>
7. <5, 6, 8>
8. <5, 6, 9>

So, after listing the unique triangles, we find that there are a total of 8 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the answer is [8].
