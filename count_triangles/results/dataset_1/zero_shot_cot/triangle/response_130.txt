Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's check:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.

Let's count the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 7, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 7, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 3>
4. Triangle <0, 8, 4>
5. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
6. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
7. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
8. Triangle <1, 6, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
