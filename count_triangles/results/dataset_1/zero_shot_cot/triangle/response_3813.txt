Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will enumerate all possible triangles by identifying all sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected. Below is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 5, 4>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <1, 4, 2>
5. <3, 6, 4>
6. <3, 9, 0>
7. <5, 7, 6>
8. <5, 7, 8>
9. <5, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
