Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three vertices that are connected to each other.

By observing the edges mentioned in the input, we can list down all the triangles. Here, I will list the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 1, 6>
4. <0, 2, 5>
5. <0, 2, 6>
6. <1, 2, 7>
7. <1, 2, 8>
8. <3, 4, 8>
9. <4, 6, 9>
10. <4, 8, 9>
11. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in total in the given graph. So, the output would be [11].
