Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Triangles involving Node 0:
   - <0, 3, 5>
   - <0, 5, 6>
   - <0, 5, 7>

2. Triangles involving Node 1:
   - <1, 2, 5>
   - <1, 5, 9>

3. Triangles involving Node 2:
   - <2, 1, 5>
   - <2, 4, 8>
   - <2, 5, 9>

4. Triangles involving Node 3:
   - No triangles with Node 3.

5. Triangles involving Node 4:
   - No triangles with Node 4.

6. Triangles involving Node 5:
   - <5, 0, 3>
   - <5, 1, 9>

7. Triangles involving Node 6:
   - No triangles with Node 6.

8. Triangles involving Node 7:
   - No triangles with Node 7.

9. Triangles involving Node 8:
   - No triangles with Node 8.

10. Triangles involving Node 9:
    - No triangles with Node 9.

From the above analysis, we have found the following unique triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <5, 0, 3>, and <5, 1, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
