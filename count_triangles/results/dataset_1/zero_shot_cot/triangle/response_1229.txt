Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look at each possible triangle formed by 3 nodes and check if there are edges connecting all 3 nodes. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <1, 2, 4>
4. <1, 2, 8>
5. <1, 8, 9>
6. <2, 4, 6>
7. <2, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
