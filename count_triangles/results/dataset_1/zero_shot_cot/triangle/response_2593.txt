Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible combinations of three nodes that form a triangle.

Let's list the triangles one by one:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 7, 8>
4. <1, 6, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in brackets []:
