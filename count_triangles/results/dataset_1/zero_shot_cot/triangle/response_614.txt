Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
We can count the number of triangles by looking for nodes that have mutual connections with each other. Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. <1, 5, 6>
2. <1, 5, 2>
3. <1, 5, 3>
4. <1, 6, 2>
5. <1, 7, 4>
6. <2, 5, 6>
7. <3, 5, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
