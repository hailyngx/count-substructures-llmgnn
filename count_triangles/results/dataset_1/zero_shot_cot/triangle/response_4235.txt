Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify the triangles formed by the edges given. Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
    - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
    - Triangle 2: <0, 3, 6>
    - Triangle 3: <0, 4, 6>
    - Triangle 4: <1, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
