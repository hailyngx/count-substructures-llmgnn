Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes connected to each other forming triangles. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Look for triangles formed by nodes connected to each other:
   - Triangle 1: Nodes {0, 1, 4}
   - Triangle 2: Nodes {3, 4, 5}
   - Triangle 3: Nodes {3, 7, 9}
   - Triangle 4: Nodes {4, 8, 9}

Thus, we have found 4 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
