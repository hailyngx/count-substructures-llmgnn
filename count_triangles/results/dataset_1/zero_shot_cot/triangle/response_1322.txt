Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 4.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
5. Node 5 is connected to node 1.
6. Node 6 is connected to node 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to node 0.
8. Node 8 is connected to node 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 4)
- Triangle 2: (1, 4, 0)
- Triangle 3: (1, 4, 2)
- Triangle 4: (1, 5, 0)
- Triangle 5: (9, 6, 0)

Thus, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 5, 0>, <9, 6, 0>.
