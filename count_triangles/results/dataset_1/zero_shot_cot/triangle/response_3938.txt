Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Triangle formed by nodes (0, 4, 5)
2. Triangle formed by nodes (0, 5, 7)
3. Triangle formed by nodes (0, 7, 1)
4. Triangle formed by nodes (7, 1, 9)
5. Triangle formed by nodes (1, 9, 3)
6. Triangle formed by nodes (9, 3, 6)
7. Triangle formed by nodes (3, 6, 9)
8. Triangle formed by nodes (8, 5, 0)
9. Triangle formed by nodes (5, 0, 4)
10. Triangle formed by nodes (7, 0, 5)
11. Triangle formed by nodes (0, 5, 8)
12. Triangle formed by nodes (8, 5, 7)
13. Triangle formed by nodes (7, 5, 8)
14. Triangle formed by nodes (5, 8, 9)
15. Triangle formed by nodes (9, 8, 7)
16. Triangle formed by nodes (8, 7, 9)
17. Triangle formed by nodes (7, 9, 1)
18. Triangle formed by nodes (9, 1, 7)
19. Triangle formed by nodes (1, 7, 8)
20. Triangle formed by nodes (7, 8, 5)
21. Triangle formed by nodes (5, 8, 7)
22. Triangle formed by nodes (8, 7, 0)
23. Triangle formed by nodes (7, 0, 4)
24. Triangle formed by nodes (0, 4, 5)
25. Triangle formed by nodes (5, 4, 0)

Therefore, there are 25 total triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 1>, <7, 1, 9>, <1, 9, 3>, <9, 3, 6>, <8, 5, 0>, <7, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <9, 8, 7>, and so on.
