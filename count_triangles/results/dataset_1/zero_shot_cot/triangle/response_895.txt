Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 6, 1>, <6, 5, 4>, <7, 9, 1>.
