Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 4, 5, and 8. (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 8), (0, 5, 8)
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 4, 6. (1, 4, 6)
3. Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 4, 6, and 7. (2, 4, 6), (2, 4, 7), (2, 6, 7)
4. Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 4, 8, and 9. (3, 4, 8), (3, 4, 9), (3, 8, 9)
5. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 6, 8. (4, 6, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 8>.
