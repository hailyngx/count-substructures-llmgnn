Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
