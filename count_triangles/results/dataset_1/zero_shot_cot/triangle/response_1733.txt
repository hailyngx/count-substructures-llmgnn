Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of 3 nodes that are interconnected. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 3 and 9.
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
5. Node 4: Connected to node 6.
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 1 and 6.
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangles involving node 1: <0, 1, 5>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 9>
3. Triangles involving node 3: <0, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 6, 9>
4. Triangles involving node 6: <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 9>
5. Triangles involving node 9: <2, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <7, 9, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [11]
