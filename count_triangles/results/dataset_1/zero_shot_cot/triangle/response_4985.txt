Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can iterate through all possible triangles formed by the nodes and check if each triangle is valid based on the given edges. Let's proceed step by step:

1. The total number of triangles can be calculated using the number of triangles passing through each node. Since each triangle has 3 edges, the number of triangles passing through a node can be calculated by the formula: 

   Total triangles passing through a node = ((number of edges connected to the node) choose 2)

2. Now, let's calculate the number of triangles passing through each node based on the given edges:
   
   - Node 0: Total triangles = ((2 choose 2) + (2 choose 2)) = 1 + 1 = 2
   - Node 1: Total triangles = ((2 choose 2) + (2 choose 2)) = 1 + 1 = 2
   - Node 2: Total triangles = ((2 choose 2) + (2 choose 2)) = 1 + 1 = 2
   - Node 3: Total triangles = ((4 choose 2) + (4 choose 2) + (4 choose 2)) = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18
   - Node 4: Total triangles = ((2 choose 2) + (2 choose 2)) = 1 + 1 = 2
   - Node 5: Total triangles = ((2 choose 2) + (2 choose 2)) = 1 + 1 = 2
   - Node 6: Total triangles = ((3 choose 2) + (3 choose 2)) = 3 + 3 = 6
   - Node 7: Total triangles = ((3 choose 2) + (3 choose 2)) = 3 + 3 = 6
   - Node 8: Total triangles = ((1 choose 2)) = 0
   - Node 9: Total triangles = ((3 choose 2) + (3 choose 2) + (3 choose 2)) = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9

3. Summing up the total triangles passing through each node:
   Total triangles = 2 + 2 + 2 + 18 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 0 + 9 = 49
   
Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [49]. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 9, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 6, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 0>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 5, 1>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 8, 7>
