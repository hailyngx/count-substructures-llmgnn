Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected with edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
4. Triangle <0, 8, 5>
5. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <5, 8, 1>
7. Triangle <5, 1, 9>
8. Triangle <5, 7, 1>
9. Triangle <6, 7, 0>
10. Triangle <7, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
