Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles:
   - Node 1: Adjacent to nodes 2, 4, 5
   - Node 2: Adjacent to nodes 1, 7, 9
   - Node 4: Adjacent to nodes 1, 7, 9
   - Node 5: Adjacent to nodes 1, 8
   - Node 7: Adjacent to nodes 2, 4
   - Node 8: Adjacent to node 5
   - Node 9: Adjacent to nodes 2, 3, 4

2. Write down the unique triangles:
   - <1, 2, 4>
   - <1, 2, 5>
   - <1, 4, 7>
   - <2, 4, 9>

3. Count the total number of unique triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: [4]
