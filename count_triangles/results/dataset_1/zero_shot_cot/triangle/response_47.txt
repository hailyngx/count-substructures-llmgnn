Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected in a triangle are: (0, 4, 9) and (1, 2, 6).
2. Now, let's try to find if there are any triangles formed by choosing 3 nodes among the 10 nodes.
3. The possible triangles are: 
   - <0, 1, 2>
   - <0, 1, 6>
   - <0, 2, 6>
   - <4, 0, 9>
   - <5, 9, 6>
   - <5, 9, 0>
   - <6, 1, 7>
   - <6, 7, 9>
   - <9, 0, 5>
   - <9, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
