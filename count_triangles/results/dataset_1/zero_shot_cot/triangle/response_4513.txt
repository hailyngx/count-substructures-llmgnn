Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph. To form a triangle, three nodes need to be connected to each other. We will look for triangles by examining all possible combinations of three nodes.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 2, 4>
4. <1, 0, 9>
5. <1, 8, 9>
6. <2, 0, 4>
7. <2, 4, 7>
8. <4, 3, 7>
9. <6, 0, 9>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in total. So, the answer is [9].
