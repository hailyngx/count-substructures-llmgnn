Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 0.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7.

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 4, 1>
- Triangle <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle <1, 9, 7>
- Triangle <0, 7, 4>
- Triangle <1, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
