Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are fully connected. Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. From the given edge list, we identify the following triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 2: <1, 7, 6>
- Triangle 3: <1, 7, 5>
  
2. We count the total number of triangles obtained above.
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
