Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Let's determine the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 7>: (0, 3), (3, 7), (7, 0).
2. Triangle <0, 3, 9>: (0, 3), (3, 9), (9, 0).
3. Triangle <0, 4, 7>: (0, 4), (4, 7), (7, 0).
4. Triangle <0, 4, 9>: (0, 4), (4, 9), (9, 0).
5. Triangle <3, 4, 5>: (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3).
6. Triangle <3, 4, 9>: (3, 4), (4, 9), (9, 3).
7. Triangle <3, 5, 9>: (3, 5), (5, 9), (9, 3).
8. Triangle <4, 5, 7>: (4, 5), (5, 7), (7, 4).
9. Triangle <4, 5, 9>: (4, 5), (5, 9), (9, 4).
10. Triangle <7, 8, 4>: (7, 8), (8, 4), (4, 7).

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph: [10].
