Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Checking each possible triangle combination:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <2, 5, 6>
4. <6, 5, 7>
5. <3, 8, 4>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [0].
