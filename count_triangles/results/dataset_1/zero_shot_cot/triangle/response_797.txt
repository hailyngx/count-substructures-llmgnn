Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here's the process of counting the triangles step by step:
1. Identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 4, and 9 form a triangle because there are edges connecting all three nodes - (0, 4), (4, 9), and (9, 0).
   - Triangle 2: Nodes 0, 5, and 8 form a triangle because there are edges connecting all three nodes - (0, 5), (5, 8), and (8, 0).
   - Triangle 3: Nodes 0, 6, and 5 form a triangle because there are edges connecting all three nodes - (0, 6), (6, 5), and (5, 0).
   - Triangle 4: Nodes 5, 6, and 7 form a triangle because there are edges connecting all three nodes - (5, 6), (6, 7), and (7, 5).
   
2. List the unique triangles:
   - <0, 4, 9>
   - <0, 5, 8>
   - <0, 6, 5>
   - <5, 6, 7>
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
