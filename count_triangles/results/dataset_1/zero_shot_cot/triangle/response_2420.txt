Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
By examining the provided graph, we can identify the following triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 5, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle 3: <0, 8, 9>
- Triangle 4: <1, 6, 2>
- Triangle 5: <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle 6: <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle 7: <2, 4, 3>
- Triangle 8: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 9: <2, 6, 1>
- Triangle 10: <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle 11: <2, 7, 2>
- Triangle 12: <3, 4, 5>
- Triangle 13: <4, 5, 0>
- Triangle 14: <4, 5, 8>
- Triangle 15: <4, 5, 0>
- Triangle 16: <4, 5, 8>
- Triangle 17: <5, 0, 8>
- Triangle 18: <6, 1, 9>
- Triangle 19: <8, 0, 5>
- Triangle 20: <8, 0, 9>
- Triangle 21: <8, 9, 1>
- Triangle 22: <9, 1, 6>
- Triangle 23: <9, 1, 6>
- Triangle 24: <9, 1, 6>
- Triangle 25: <9, 8, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of [25] triangles in the given graph.
