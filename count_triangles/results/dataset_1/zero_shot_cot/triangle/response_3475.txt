Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Let's analyze the graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes directly connected (adjacent nodes):
    - Node 0: 7
    - Node 1: 3, 4, 8
    - Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6
    - Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
    - Node 5: 3, 4, 9
    - Node 6: 3, 8
    - Node 7: 0, 4
    - Node 8: 1, 4, 6, 9
    - Node 9: 5, 8

2. Possible triangles based on the given edges:
    - <3, 4, 5>
    - <4, 8, 9>

3. Count of triangles: 2

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
