Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for cycles of length 3.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <2, 3, 6>
5. <2, 5, 9>
6. <3, 5, 6>
7. <5, 8, 9>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
