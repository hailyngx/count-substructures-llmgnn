Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list down the triangles in the graph by identifying the nodes that form triangles together:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
4. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
5. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
6. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
7. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
8. Triangle <5, 4, 7>
9. Triangle <5, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [9].
