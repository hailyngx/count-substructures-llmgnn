Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: <0, 3, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, and <5, 6, 9>.

So, the total number of triangles is [4].
