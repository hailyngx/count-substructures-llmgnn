Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph as an adjacency list based on the given edges:

Node 0: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 1, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 8
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 0, 6
Node 6: 5
Node 7: 0, 2
Node 8: 0, 3, 9
Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 8

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's list down the triangles:

1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <0, 8, 9>
3. <0, 7, 2>
4. <0, 9, 4>
5. <2, 7, 9>
6. <8, 9, 4>

There are 6 triangles in this graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
