Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step to find the total number of triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles within the graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle 2: <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
