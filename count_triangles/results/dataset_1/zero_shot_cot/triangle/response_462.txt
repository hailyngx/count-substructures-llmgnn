Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 0.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 8.

Now, let's count the triangles:
- The triangle <0, 4, 6> is formed.
- The triangle <0, 1, 9> is formed.
- The triangle <1, 2, 9> is formed.
- The triangle <5, 3, 7> is formed.
- The triangle <0, 6, 8> is formed.
- The triangle <2, 7, 9> is formed.
- The triangle <0, 9, 7> is formed.
- The triangle <7, 8, 9> is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
