Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles that can be formed in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 5, 4>
7. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
8. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
9. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
10. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
11. Triangle <5, 8, 9>
12. Triangle <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph. So, the output is [12].
