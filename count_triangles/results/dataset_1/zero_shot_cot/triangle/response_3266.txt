Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we identify the triangles in the graph step by step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9, forming the triangle <0, 1, 4>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7, forming the triangle <0, 1, 7>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9, forming the triangle <2, 3, 6>.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6, forming the triangle <1, 2, 3>.
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9, forming the triangle <2, 3, 6>.
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8, forming the triangle <1, 3, 7>.
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6, forming the triangle <0, 2, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
