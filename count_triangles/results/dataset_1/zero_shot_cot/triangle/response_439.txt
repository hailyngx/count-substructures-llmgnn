Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, to find the number of triangles, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes. Here are the triangles found within the graph:

1. <0, 7, 8>
2. <0, 7, 9>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <1, 4, 9>
5. <5, 6, 9>
6. <8, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
