Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
By analyzing the provided graph, we can see that the triangles formed are as follows:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <1, 5, 8>
5. <1, 6, 9>
6. <1, 7, 8>
7. <3, 6, 9>
8. <3, 7, 9>
9. <4, 7, 9>
10. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
