Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all interconnected with each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes directly connected:
   - Triangles: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 8>
   
2. Checking possible triangles involving node 0:
   - There are no triangles involving node 0.
   
3. Checking possible triangles involving node 4 and node 8:
   - There are no triangles involving node 4 or node 8.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 8>.
