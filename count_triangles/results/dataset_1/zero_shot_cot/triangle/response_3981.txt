Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles found in the graph:
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <4, 1, 7>
- <7, 9, 4>

Count of triangles in the graph: [6]
