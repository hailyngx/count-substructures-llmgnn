Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
2. Nodes connected to node 1: {8, 9}
3. Nodes connected to node 2: {3}
4. Nodes connected to node 3: {0, 2, 6}
5. Nodes connected to node 4: {8, 9}
6. Nodes connected to node 5: {0, 8, 9}
7. Nodes connected to node 6: {0, 3, 7}
8. Nodes connected to node 7: {0, 6}
9. Nodes connected to node 8: {0, 1, 4, 5}
10. Nodes connected to node 9: {1, 4, 5}

Let's enumerate the triangles:
1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <3, 6, 0>
5. <4, 8, 9>
6. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the graph has a total of [6] triangles.
