Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
We can determine the number of triangles in the graph by looking for each unique triangle formed by three connected nodes.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.

Now, let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <1, 2, 9>
2. <2, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
