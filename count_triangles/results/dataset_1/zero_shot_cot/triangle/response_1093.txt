Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all the sets of three nodes that are interconnected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <4, 8, 1>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
