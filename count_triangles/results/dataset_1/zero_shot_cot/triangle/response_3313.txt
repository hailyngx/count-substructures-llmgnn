Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 7, 9>
3. <1, 3, 8>
4. <3, 5, 8>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <4, 5, 8>
7. <5, 6, 8>
8. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
