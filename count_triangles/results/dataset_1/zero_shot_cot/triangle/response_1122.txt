Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in this graph by looking for nodes that are connected in a triangular manner.

Upon examining the edges, we can find the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <1, 2, 4>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <1, 2, 9>
5. <3, 4, 5>
6. <5, 9, 1>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
