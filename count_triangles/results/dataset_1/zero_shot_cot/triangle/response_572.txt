Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all the triangles in the graph.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's begin by identifying the triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 3, 8>
4. <1, 4, 8>
5. <1, 8, 9>
6. <2, 3, 8>
7. <3, 6, 9>
8. <5, 6, 8>

Now, count the total number of unique triangles: [8].

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
