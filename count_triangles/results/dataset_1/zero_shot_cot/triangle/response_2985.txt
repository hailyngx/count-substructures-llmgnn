Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. A triangle consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the set.

Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Check for all possible triangles by looking at each node and its neighbors:

- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 3)
- Triangle 2: (0, 1, 7)
- Triangle 3: (0, 4, 7)
- Triangle 4: (0, 7, 9)
- Triangle 5: (1, 3, 4)
- Triangle 6: (1, 4, 7)
- Triangle 7: (2, 0, 4)
- Triangle 8: (4, 6, 7)
- Triangle 9: (5, 7, 8)

Counting the total number of triangles, we have found 9 triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9]. Unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 0, 4>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 8>.
