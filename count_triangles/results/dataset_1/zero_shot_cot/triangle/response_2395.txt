Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <1, 7, 8>
3. <2, 0, 3>
4. <4, 5, 6>
5. <6, 7, 9> 

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
