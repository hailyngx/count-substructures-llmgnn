Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 5, 7>, <8, 9, 1>.
