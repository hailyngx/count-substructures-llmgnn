Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, and <3, 5, 9>.
