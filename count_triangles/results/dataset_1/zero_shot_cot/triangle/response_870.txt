Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are in total [9] triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 9, 2>, <3, 9, 6>, <9, 1, 5>, <9, 2, 5>, <9, 3, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, and <5, 6, 0>.
