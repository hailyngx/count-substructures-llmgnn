Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we will count the number of triangles in the graph. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes connected by edges forming a closed loop.

Let's calculate the total number of triangles:

1. Check each node for possible triangles:
   - Node 0: Possible triangles = {0, 2, 4}, {0, 5, 6}, {0, 6, 7}
   - Node 1: Possible triangles = {1, 2, 6}, {1, 3, 7}, {1, 7, 9}
   - Node 2: Possible triangles = {0, 1, 2}, {2, 8, 1}
   - Node 3: Possible triangles = {1, 3, 7}
   - Node 4: Possible triangles = {0, 4, 6}, {4, 6, 9}
   - Node 5: Possible triangles = {0, 5, 6}
   - Node 6: Possible triangles = {0, 5, 6}, {1, 2, 6}, {3, 1, 7}, {4, 6, 0}, {4, 6, 5}
   - Node 7: Possible triangles = {0, 6, 7}, {1, 3, 7}
   - Node 8: No triangle
   - Node 9: Possible triangles = {1, 7, 9}, {4, 6, 9}

2. List the unique triangles found:
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <0, 5, 6>
   - <0, 6, 7>
   - <1, 2, 6>
   - <1, 3, 7>
   - <1, 7, 9>
   - <2, 8, 1>
   - <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
