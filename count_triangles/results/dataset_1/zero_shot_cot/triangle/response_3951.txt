Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 2.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8.

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <5, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <3, 6, 8>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
7. Triangle <5, 6, 9>
8. Triangle <5, 7, 9>
9. Triangle <6, 7, 5>
10. Triangle <7, 5, 1>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in this graph. So, the total number of triangles is [10].
