Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all the triangles:

Nodes involved in triangles:
- (0, 8, 6)
- (0, 9, 6)
- (1, 5, 2)
- (1, 5, 4)
- (1, 5, 6)
- (1, 6, 4)
- (2, 5, 4)
- (2, 5, 7)
- (2, 6, 7)
- (2, 7, 5)
- (3, 6, 9)
- (4, 5, 6)
- (5, 1, 6)
- (5, 2, 4)
- (5, 2, 7)
- (5, 4, 6)
- (5, 6, 7)
- (6, 1, 4)
- (6, 2, 7)
- (7, 2, 5)
- (9, 0, 6)
- (9, 3, 6)

2. Count the total number of identified triangles:
- Total number of triangles = 22

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [22]. Some of the unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 8, 6>, <0, 9, 6>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 4>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 2, 4>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 2, 7>, <7, 2, 5>, <9, 0, 6>, <9, 3, 6>.
