Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangles involving node 0: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 9>
2. Triangles involving node 1: <1, 2, 5>
3. Triangles involving node 2: <0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 4>
4. Triangles involving node 3: No triangles
5. Triangles involving node 4: <0, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 6>
6. Triangles involving node 5: <0, 5, 1>, <5, 6, 8>
7. Triangles involving node 6: <4, 6, 5>, <6, 7, 8>
8. Triangles involving node 7: <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>
9. Triangles involving node 8: <5, 8, 7>
10. Triangles involving node 9: <0, 9, 4>, <3, 9, 4>, <7, 9, 0>

Counting them all, we find a total of [17] triangles in the graph.
