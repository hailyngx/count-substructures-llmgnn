Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by identifying the number of common neighbors between each pair of nodes. Then, each triangle should be counted three times (once for each node in the triangle). Here's how to calculate it step-by-step:

1. Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}.
2. Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4}.
3. Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}.
4. Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6}.
5. Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 7}.
6. Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7, 8}.
7. Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4}.
8. Node 7: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5}.
9. Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5}.
10. Node 9: Neighbors = {2}.

Now, let's find the triangles:

- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
