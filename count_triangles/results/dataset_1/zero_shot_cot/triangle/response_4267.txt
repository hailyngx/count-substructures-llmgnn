Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find all the triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 5, 1>
- <4, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is **[9]**.
