Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in matrix form to easily detect triangles. Let \( G \) be the adjacency matrix of the graph where \( G_{i,j} = 1 \) if there exists an edge between node \( i \) and node \( j \), and \( G_{i,j} = 0 \) otherwise.

The adjacency matrix \( G \) for the given graph is as follows:
\[ 
\begin{matrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{matrix}
\]

Next, let's look for triangles in the graph by checking for each possible triangle formed by three distinct nodes.

The triangles found in the graph are:
1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 4, 6>
5. <1, 6, 7>
6. <2, 3, 6>
7. <2, 6, 9>
8. <3, 4, 9>
9. <5, 8, 9>
10. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
