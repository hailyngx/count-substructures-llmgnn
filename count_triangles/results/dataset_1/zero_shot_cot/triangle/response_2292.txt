Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to see which sets of three nodes form triangles by having edges between each pair of nodes.

Let's list the possible triangles:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <1, 4, 9>
6. <4, 5, 9>
7. <0, 6, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
