Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 3, 9>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 3, 5>, <2, 7, 1>.
