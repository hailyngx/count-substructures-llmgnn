Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, and <6, 8, 9>.
