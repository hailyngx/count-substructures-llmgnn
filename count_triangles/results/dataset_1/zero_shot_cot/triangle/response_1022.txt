Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

Here are the triangles in the given graph:
1. <0, 6, 1>
2. <0, 6, 7>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <0, 6, 9>
5. <0, 7, 2>
6. <0, 7, 3>
7. <0, 8, 1>
8. <0, 8, 7>
9. <0, 9, 5>
10. <1, 6, 7>
11. <1, 6, 8>
12. <2, 5, 9>
13. <2, 7, 3>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [13].
