Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. In other words, we need to find all triangles in the graph.

In this case, we have the following edges:
- (0, 5)
- (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7)
- (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7)
- (3, 9)
- (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 9)
- (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 9)
- (6, 2), (6, 9)
- (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 9)
- (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Let's count the triangles:

1. Triangle involving nodes 1, 2, and 4: <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle involving nodes 1, 2, and 5: <1, 2, 5>
3. Triangle involving nodes 1, 5, and 7: <1, 5, 7>
4. Triangle involving nodes 2, 4, and 9: <2, 4, 9>
5. Triangle involving nodes 2, 5, and 9: <2, 5, 9>
6. Triangle involving nodes 4, 5, and 9: <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
