Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's first identify all the triangles present in the graph. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can determine the following unique triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <4, 5, 8>

Hence, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
