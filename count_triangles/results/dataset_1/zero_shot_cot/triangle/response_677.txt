Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Write down all triangles by examining each node pair in the given graph to check if there is a third node forming a triangle.

Triangular loops:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 9>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <5, 8, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.
Total number of triangles = 5
