Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a simpler way to visualize it better:

```
0---2
|\ /|
| 4 |
|/ \|
8---9

1---7
| / |
6---5
```

Now, to find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to check all possible combinations of nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three vertices are connected to each other. Let's find them step-by-step:

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 4, 8), (0, 4, 9)
2. Node 1: (1, 6, 7), (1, 7, 9)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 4), (2, 4, 6)
4. Node 3: No triangles
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 2), (4, 0, 8), (4, 0, 9), (4, 2, 8), (4, 2, 3), (4, 2, 6), (4, 3, 8), (4, 7, 5)
6. Node 5: No triangles
7. Node 6: (6, 1, 7), (6, 1, 9), (6, 2, 4)
8. Node 7: (7, 1, 6), (7, 1, 9), (7, 4, 5)
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 4), (8, 0, 3), (8, 3, 4)
10. Node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 1, 6), (9, 0, 4)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [19]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 0, 2>, <4, 0, 8>, <4, 0, 9>, <4, 2, 8>, <4, 2, 3>, <4, 2, 6>, <4, 3, 8>, <4, 7, 5>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 2, 4>, <7, 1, 6>, <7, 1, 9>, <7, 4, 5>, <8, 0, 4>, <8, 0, 3>, <8, 3, 4>, <9, 0, 1>, <9, 1, 6>, <9, 0, 4>.
