Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: For every node in the graph, identify all possible triangles that can be formed. To form a triangle, we need three nodes connected by edges. 

For node 0: (0,1,5)
For node 1: (0,1,4), (1,2,4), (1,8,9)
For node 2: (1,2,7)
For node 3: (3,4,8)
For node 4: (0,1,4), (3,4,6), (4,6,9), (1,4,9)
For node 5: (0,1,5)
For node 6: (4,6,9)
For node 7: (1,2,7)
For node 8: (1,8,9), (3,8,9)
For node 9: (1,4,9), (4,6,9), (8,9,6)

Step 2: List the unique triangles identified:

<0,1,5>, <0,1,4>, <1,2,4>, <1,8,9>, <1,2,7>, <3,4,8>, <4,6,9>, <8,9,6>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique triangles found.

There are a total of 8 unique triangles present in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
