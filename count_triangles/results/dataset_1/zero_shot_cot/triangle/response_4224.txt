Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes that form triangles by checking each combination of 3 nodes connected by edges:
- Nodes (0, 2, 4) form a triangle.
- Nodes (0, 2, 6) form a triangle.
- Nodes (0, 7, 9) form a triangle.
- Nodes (1, 3, 6) form a triangle.
- Nodes (3, 6, 9) form a triangle.
- Nodes (6, 7, 9) form a triangle.
- Nodes (6, 8, 9) form a triangle.

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles found in Step 1.
- Total number of triangles found = 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>.
