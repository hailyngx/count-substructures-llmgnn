Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are interconnected. Let's look at each triangle individually:

1. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 3>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 8, 6>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 6, 9>

By counting the unique triangles found above, we can see there are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
