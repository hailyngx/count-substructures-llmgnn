Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by the nodes in the graph. A triangle is a set of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two.

In this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 2>
2. <0, 6, 8>
3. <6, 1, 8>
4. <6, 8, 0>
5. <6, 8, 1>
6. <6, 8, 2>
7. <6, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
