Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph.

1. From node 0: (0, 3, 7), (0, 4, 7), (0, 7, 8), (0, 7, 9)
2. From node 1: (1, 4, 7)
3. From node 2: (2, 6, 7)
4. From node 4: (4, 5, 9)

Now we count the number of triangles:
There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
