Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, and 8.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
