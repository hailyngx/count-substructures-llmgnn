Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other (i.e., form a triangle).

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:
1. Nodes connected to node 0: 4, 5, 8
2. Nodes connected to node 1: 3, 5, 8
3. Nodes connected to node 3: 1, 7, 8, 9
4. Nodes connected to node 4: 0
5. Nodes connected to node 5: 0, 1, 6, 9
6. Nodes connected to node 6: 5, 7
7. Nodes connected to node 7: 3, 6
8. Nodes connected to node 8: 0, 1, 3, 9
9. Nodes connected to node 9: 3, 5, 8

Now, let's list the unique triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
