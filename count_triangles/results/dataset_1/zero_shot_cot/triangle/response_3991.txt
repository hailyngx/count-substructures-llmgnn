Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles present in the graph:
1. (0, 4, 7)
2. (0, 4, 9)
3. (2, 6, 9)
4. (3, 4, 5)
5. (3, 4, 7)
6. (3, 4, 9)
7. (3, 5, 9)
8. (4, 7, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
