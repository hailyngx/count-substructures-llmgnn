Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Identify all the triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected.
2. Each triangle consists of three edges, and triangles do not overlap.
3. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

After analyzing the provided graph, the total number of triangles is [1]. The unique triangle found is <1, 3, 9>.
