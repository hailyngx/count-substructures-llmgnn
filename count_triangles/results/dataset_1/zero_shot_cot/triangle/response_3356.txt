Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9. Therefore, the triangle <1, 3, 4> is formed.
2. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8. This forms the triangles <6, 2, 3>, <6, 3, 5>, <6, 5, 7>, and <6, 7, 8>.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9. So, the triangle <3, 1, 6> is formed.

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
