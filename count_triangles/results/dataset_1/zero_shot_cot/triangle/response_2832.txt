Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each unique triangle formed by three connected nodes. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <1, 4, 8>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <1, 4, 2>
4. <1, 0, 5>
5. <7, 2, 4>
6. <7, 2, 8>
7. <7, 4, 8>
