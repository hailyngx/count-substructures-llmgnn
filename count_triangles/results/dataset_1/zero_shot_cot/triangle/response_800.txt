Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. There are different approaches to finding triangles in a graph, but given that we have 10 nodes, we can use a simpler method since the graph is relatively small.

Let's list the triangles we find:

1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <3, 4, 8>
5. <3, 5, 9>

Count of triangles: [5]
