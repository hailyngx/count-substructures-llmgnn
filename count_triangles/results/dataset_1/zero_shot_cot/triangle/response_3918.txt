Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected in such a way that they form a closed loop of three edges. 

Upon analyzing the provided information, we can identify the following unique triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 1, 8>
4. <1, 2, 6>
5. <1, 3, 6>
6. <1, 3, 7>
7. <1, 4, 6>
8. <1, 8, 9>
9. <2, 6, 8>
10. <4, 6, 0>
11. <4, 6, 1>
12. <4, 6, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
