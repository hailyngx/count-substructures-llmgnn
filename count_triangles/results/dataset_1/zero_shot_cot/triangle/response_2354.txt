Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify unique triangles by checking for nodes that have edges connecting them to form a closed triangle.

In this graph, the triangles are:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <2, 6, 9>
3. <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in total.
