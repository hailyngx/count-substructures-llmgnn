Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for the presence of triangles formed by three connected nodes.

Let's list down the triangles present in this graph:

1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 6, 3>
3. <0, 9, 1>
4. <1, 2, 7>
5. <1, 9, 7>
6. <2, 4, 7>
7. <2, 9, 1>
8. <3, 6, 0>
9. <3, 7, 4>
10. <7, 9, 1>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total in this graph. So, the output will be:
[10]
