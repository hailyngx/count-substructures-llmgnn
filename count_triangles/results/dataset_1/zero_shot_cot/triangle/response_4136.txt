Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine all possible triangles formed within the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's start by listing the possible triangles:

1. <0, 6, 8>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <1, 2, 3>
5. <1, 2, 8>
6. <1, 3, 8>
7. <1, 3, 9>
8. <2, 3, 8>
9. <3, 4, 8>
10. <2, 5, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles present in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is: [10]
