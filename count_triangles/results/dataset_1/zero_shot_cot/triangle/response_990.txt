Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we'll look for every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will list all unique triangles found as requested.

Let's list the unique triangles in the graph:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
