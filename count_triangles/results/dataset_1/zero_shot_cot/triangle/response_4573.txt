Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we can find the number of triangles present. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Nodes connected to each node:
   - Node 0: {2, 3, 6}
   - Node 1: {2, 5, 9}
   - Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
   - Node 3: {0, 5, 7, 9}
   - Node 4: {2, 8}
   - Node 5: {1, 2, 3}
   - Node 6: {0}
   - Node 7: {3}
   - Node 8: {2, 4}
   - Node 9: {1, 3}

2. Triangles in the graph:
   - Triangles involving Node 0: <0, 2, 5>
   - Triangles involving Node 1: No triangles
   - Triangles involving Node 2: <0, 2, 5>
   - Triangles involving Node 3: <0, 3, 5>
   - Triangles involving Node 4: No triangles
   - Triangles involving Node 5: <0, 2, 5> and <0, 3, 5>
   - Triangles involving Node 6: No triangles
   - Triangles involving Node 7: No triangles
   - Triangles involving Node 8: No triangles
   - Triangles involving Node 9: No triangles

3. Total number of unique triangles: [<0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>]

Thus, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
