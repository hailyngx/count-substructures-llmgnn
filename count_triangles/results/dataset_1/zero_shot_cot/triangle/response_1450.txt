Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 9, 5>, <7, 5, 9>, and <8, 4, 9>.
