Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. Here's how you can approach this:

1. Identify all triangles formed by looking at each node's neighbors:
   - Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 4) => Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
   - Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2) => No new triangle
   - Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9) => Triangles: <1, 2, 9>, <2, 5, 6>
   - Node 3: (3, 2) => No new triangle
   - Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 9) => No new triangle
   - Node 5: (5, 2) => No new triangle
   - Node 6: (6, 2) => No new triangle
   - Node 7: (7, 9) => No new triangle
   - Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 7) => No new triangle

2. Total number of triangles found: [2]
    
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4> and <1, 2, 9>.
