Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we will find all possible triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges.

Here are the triangles present in the graph:
1. <1, 3, 5>
2. <1, 3, 8>
3. <1, 5, 8>
4. <1, 5, 9>
5. <2, 1, 4>
6. <2, 1, 9>
7. <2, 4, 9>
8. <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
