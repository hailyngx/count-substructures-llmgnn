Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <0, 3, 8>
4. <1, 2, 3>
5. <1, 3, 8>
6. <2, 3, 4>
7. <2, 3, 5>
8. <3, 4, 9>
9. <3, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
