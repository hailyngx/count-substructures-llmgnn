Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the given edges. Here is the list of unique triangles found:
    
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 2, 5>
4. <1, 2, 5>
5. <1, 2, 8>
6. <2, 4, 5>
7. <2, 5, 7>
8. <3, 0, 4>
9. <4, 5, 6>
10. <6, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
