Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by three connected nodes in the graph.

Looking at the edges provided:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to node 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Now, we can identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle with nodes 0, 3, and 6: <0, 3, 6>
2. Triangle with nodes 2, 4, and 5: <2, 4, 5>

Count of triangles: **[2]**.
