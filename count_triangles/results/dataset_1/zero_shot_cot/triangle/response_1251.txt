Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can first identify the triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to form a cycle of length 3.

Identifying the triangles:

1. Triangle <1,5,6>
2. Triangle <2,4,5>

Counting the number of triangles: 
There are [2] triangles in the given graph.
