Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of nodes where each node is connected to every other node in the triangle. 

Let's find the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. For node 0: (0,3), (0,7), (0,8)
2. For node 1: (1,3), (1,8)
3. For node 2: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)
4. For node 3: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,8)
5. For node 4: (4,2), (4,7), (4,9)
6. For node 5: (5,2), (5,9)
7. For node 7: (7,0), (7,4), (7,8)
8. For node 8: (8,0), (8,1), (8,3), (8,7), (8,9)
9. For node 9: (9,4), (9,5), (9,8)

Now let's list the unique triangles we found: <0, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
