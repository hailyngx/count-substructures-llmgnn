Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's find the triangles in the given graph:
1. Triangle: <0, 3, 6>
2. Triangle: <1, 4, 5>
3. Triangle: <2, 3, 5>
4. Triangle: <3, 4, 7>

[Total number of triangles: 4]
