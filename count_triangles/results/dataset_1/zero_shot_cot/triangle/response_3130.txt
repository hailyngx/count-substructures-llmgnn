Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles in this graph.

The given graph has 10 nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and 18 edges as listed.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 7, 9)
- Triangle 2: (1, 4, 9)
- Triangle 3: (1, 6, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, and <1, 6, 8>.
