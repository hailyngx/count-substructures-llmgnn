Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
1. (0, 1, 7)
2. (0, 1, 8)
3. (0, 8, 6)
4. (2, 4, 7)
5. (2, 4, 9)
6. (2, 7, 9)
7. (3, 4, 5)
8. (4, 5, 6)
9. (4, 7, 9)
10. (6, 7, 9)
11. (8, 6, 9)
12. (8, 9, 2)

There are 12 triangles in total. Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
