Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of adjacent nodes:

Node 0: 6, 8  
Node 1: 5, 7, 9  
Node 2: 5  
Node 3: 6, 8  
Node 4: 6, 7, 8  
Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7  
Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8  
Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 8  
Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7  
Node 9: 1

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:
- Node 0: (6, 8, 6), (6, 8, 8) -> <0, 6, 8>
- Node 1: (5, 7, 1) -> <1, 5, 7>
- Node 4: (6, 7, 4), (6, 8, 4), (7, 8, 4) -> <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>
- Node 5: (1, 6, 5), (1, 7, 5), (1, 2, 5), (2, 6, 5), (5, 6, 7) -> <5, 1, 6>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 1, 2>, <5, 2, 6>, <5, 6, 7>
- Node 6: (0, 4, 6), (0, 6, 8), (4, 8, 6), (5, 7, 6), (6, 7, 8) -> <6, 0, 4>, <6, 0, 8>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 8>
- Node 7: (1, 4, 7), (1, 5, 7), (4, 8, 7) -> <7, 1, 4>, <7, 1, 5>, <7, 4, 8>
- Node 8: (0, 4, 8), (0, 6, 8), (5, 6, 8), (6, 7, 8), (7, 4, 8) -> <8, 0, 4>, <8, 0, 6>, <8, 5, 6>, <8, 6, 7>, <8, 7, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [13]
