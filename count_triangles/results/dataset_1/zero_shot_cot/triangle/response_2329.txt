Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify unique triangles by observing nodes that are connected in a triangular relationship. Let's go step-by-step:

1. A triangle consists of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

2. Look for each node and see if there is a combination of 3 nodes that form a triangle.

After examining the given graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
- <1, 3, 6>
- <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
