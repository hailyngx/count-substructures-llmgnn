Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the given graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges:

```
    0 -- 1     2 -- 4
    |         / |   / |
    |        /  |  /  |
    3 ----- 9  5  8   |
    |        \  |  \  |
    |         \ |   \ |
    6          7----- 
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for combinations of 3 nodes that are fully connected to each other.

We can see that there are 4 triangles in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 9, 2>
4. <4, 7, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
