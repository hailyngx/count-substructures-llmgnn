Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle <1, 2, 8>
- Triangle <2, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
