Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the number of triangles:

Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6.
Node 4 is connected to node 2.
Node 5 is connected to node 2.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 9.
Node 8 is connected to node 6.
Node 9 is connected to node 7.

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. <1, 2, 6>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <1, 6, 3>
4. <2, 3, 6>

So the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
