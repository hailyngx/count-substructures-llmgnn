Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent this graph visually:
```
            0
           / \
          9 - 2
         /     \
        1       6
       /|       |\
      7 |       | 3
       \|       |/
        9-------5
               /
              8
```

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by three nodes connected to each other. Let's list the unique triangles found and then output the total number of triangles:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <2, 0, 9>
5. <2, 6, 3>
6. <3, 5, 6>
7. <3, 6, 5>
8. <3, 6, 8>
9. <5, 3, 6>
10. <9, 0, 1>
11. <9, 1, 3>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in this graph.
