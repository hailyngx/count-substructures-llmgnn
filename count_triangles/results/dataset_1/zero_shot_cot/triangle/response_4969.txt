Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles we find:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 9, 3>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
5. Triangle <2, 6, 9>

There are 5 triangles in total. So, the output is [5].
