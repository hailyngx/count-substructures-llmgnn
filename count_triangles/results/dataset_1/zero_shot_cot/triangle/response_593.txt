Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes and edges. 

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Identify the triangles:
   - From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
     - Triangle 1: (0, 5, 8)
     - Triangle 2: (0, 5, 9)
     - Triangle 3: (1, 5, 4)
     - Triangle 4: (5, 3, 4)
     - Triangle 5: (6, 7, 8)

2. Count the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 5

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 4>, <5, 3, 4>, and <6, 7, 8>.
