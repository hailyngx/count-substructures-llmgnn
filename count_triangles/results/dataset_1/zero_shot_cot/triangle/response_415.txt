Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8.

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph:

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <2, 3, 9>
3. <2, 4, 7>
4. <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
