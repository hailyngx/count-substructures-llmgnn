Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the given edges, we can see that the possible triangles can be formed with the following node combinations: (0, 2, 5), (0, 1, 7), (0, 4, 5), (2, 1, 7), (2, 5, 7), (4, 5, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 9>.
