Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges. 

Let's list all the triangles by examining each possible combination of three nodes connected by edges:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - <0, 1, 5>
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <0, 3, 6>

2. Triangles involving node 2:
   - <2, 4, 9>
   
3. No triangles involving node 3.

4. Triangles involving node 4:
   - <4, 5, 8>
   
5. No triangles involving node 5.

6. No triangles involving node 6.

7. No triangles involving node 7.

8. No triangles involving node 8.

9. No triangles involving node 9.

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:

[4]

The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, and <2, 4, 9>.
