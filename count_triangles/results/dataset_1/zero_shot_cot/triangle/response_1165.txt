Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by sets of three connected nodes. We can do this by looking for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the set.

Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {2, 8, 9}
2. Nodes connected to node 1: {5, 7}
3. Nodes connected to node 2: {0, 4, 6}
4. Nodes connected to node 3: {4, 8}
5. Nodes connected to node 4: {2, 3, 8, 9}
6. Nodes connected to node 5: {1, 8}
7. Nodes connected to node 6: {2}
8. Nodes connected to node 7: {1, 9}
9. Nodes connected to node 8: {0, 3, 4, 5}
10. Nodes connected to node 9: {0, 4, 7}

Now, let's list the unique triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <1, 5, 8>
5. <1, 7, 9>
6. <2, 4, 8>
7. <4, 8, 9> 

Count of triangles: [7]
