Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by three connected nodes. Here are the steps to determine the total number of triangles:

**Step 1:** List all the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <0, 7, 9>
5. <2, 1, 3>
6. <2, 1, 3>
7. <2, 3, 6>
8. <2, 3, 7>
9. <2, 6, 4>
10. <2, 6, 4>
11. <2, 6, 7>
12. <4, 5, 6>
13. <7, 0, 9>
14. <7, 2, 9>

**Step 2:** Count the total number of unique triangles: [14] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 14, and the unique triangles are detailed above.
