Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can count the number of triangles by examining the connections between nodes.

Let's list all the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
7. Triangle <2, 4, 7>
8. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
9. Triangle <4, 7, 5>
10. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
11. Triangle <5, 7, 8>
12. Triangle <6, 1, 2>
13. Triangle <8, 4, 5>
14. Triangle <8, 4, 7>

Therefore, there are total [14] triangles in the given graph.
