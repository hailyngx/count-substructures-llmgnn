Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 3.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles present in the graph:
- <1, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
