Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles found in this graph:

1. <1, 3, 5>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <1, 7, 9>
5. <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
