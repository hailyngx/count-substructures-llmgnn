Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>.
