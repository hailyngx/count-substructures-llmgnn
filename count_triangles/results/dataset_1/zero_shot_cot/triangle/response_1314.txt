Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles in the graph:

1. Check each possible combination of three nodes from the given graph.
2. Verify if there is an edge between each pair of nodes in the combination.
3. If an edge exists between every pair of the three nodes, then it forms a triangle.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
