Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, and <1, 5, 9>.
