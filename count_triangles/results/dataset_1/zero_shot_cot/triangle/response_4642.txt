Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle 1: (1, 3, 6)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 3, 7)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 5, 7)
4. Triangle 4: (2, 3, 9)
5. Triangle 5: (3, 4, 9)
6. Triangle 6: (3, 5, 8)
7. Triangle 7: (3, 6, 7)
8. Triangle 8: (3, 8, 9)
9. Triangle 9: (4, 5, 6)
10. Triangle 10: (4, 5, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
