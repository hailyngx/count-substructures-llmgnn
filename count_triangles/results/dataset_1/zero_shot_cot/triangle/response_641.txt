Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is a set of three nodes connected pairwise by edges. Let's list out the triangles in the graph step by step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 4, 3)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 5, 3)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 5, 4)
4. Triangle 4: (2, 6, 1)
5. Triangle 5: (2, 6, 7)
6. Triangle 6: (2, 7, 5)
7. Triangle 7: (2, 7, 6)
8. Triangle 8: (2, 7, 9)
9. Triangle 9: (3, 4, 5)
10. Triangle 10: (5, 4, 0)
11. Triangle 11: (5, 4, 3)
12. Triangle 12: (5, 4, 0)
13. Triangle 13: (5, 4, 3)
14. Triangle 14: (5, 4, 0)
15. Triangle 15: (5, 4, 3)
16. Triangle 16: (5, 6, 7)
17. Triangle 17: (6, 1, 5)
18. Triangle 18: (6, 2, 7)
19. Triangle 19: (7, 2, 9)
20. Triangle 20: (7, 5, 1)
21. Triangle 21: (7, 5, 3)
22. Triangle 22: (7, 5, 4)
23. Triangle 23: (7, 5, 3)
24. Triangle 24: (7, 5, 4)
25. Triangle 25: (7, 5, 3)
26. Triangle 26: (7, 5, 4)

As we can see, there are 26 triangles in total. However, some of them are duplicates due to the direction of the edges.

Therefore, the total number of unique triangles in the given graph is [21].
