Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are all adjacent to each other. Let's list the triangles and then count them.

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <1, 0, 7>
5. <2, 0, 6>
6. <3, 4, 6>
7. <4, 6, 8>
8. <4, 7, 6>
9. <4, 8, 6>

Total number of triangles: [9]
