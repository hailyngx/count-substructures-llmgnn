Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle. Let's begin the step-by-step process:

1. First, let's list out all the triangles formed by checking each set of three nodes that are connected to each other:

- Triangle 1: (0, 4, 6)
- Triangle 2: (1, 3, 5)
- Triangle 3: (1, 5, 8)
- Triangle 4: (2, 6, 8)

2. Now we need to check for triangles that may not have been explicitly listed. One way to do this is to look for nodes that have two common neighbors forming a triangle. Let's check for such triangles:

- Node 0: Common neighbors are 4 and 6, forming a triangle (0, 4, 6)
- Node 1: Common neighbors are 3 and 5, forming a triangle (1, 3, 5)
- Node 5: Common neighbors are 1 and 8, forming a triangle (1, 5, 8)
- Node 6: Common neighbors are 0 and 8, forming a triangle (0, 6, 8)

3. Finally, let's summarize the total number of triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
