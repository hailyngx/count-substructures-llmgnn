Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles by finding sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Look for nodes that are connected to each other, forming potential triangles:

- <0, 7, 9>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 6, 5>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 6, 9>

2. Calculate the total number of triangles from the identified sets:

Total number of triangles = 5

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
