Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Finding all triangles in a graph can be a bit time-consuming, especially as the graph gets larger. To help you visualize the triangles, I'll list them out and then count them. Here are the unique triangles present in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <1, 6, 9>
5. <2, 3, 7>

Count of triangles inside brackets []: [5]
