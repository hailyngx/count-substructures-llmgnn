Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 0.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.

Now, we will identify the triangles by checking each possible set of 3 connected nodes to see if they form a triangle.

The possible triangles in this graph are:
1. <1, 4, 8>
2. <1, 5, 8>
3. <1, 7, 8>
4. <4, 5, 8>
5. <4, 7, 8>
6. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
