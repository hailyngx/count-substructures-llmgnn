Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Given the edges provided in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
