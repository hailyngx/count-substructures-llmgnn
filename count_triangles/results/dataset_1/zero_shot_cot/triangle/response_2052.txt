Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the interconnected nodes. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the triangle.

Given the edges: (0, 8), (2, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 2), (6, 9), (8, 0), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 6).

Let's list down the unique triangles:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <4, 6, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
