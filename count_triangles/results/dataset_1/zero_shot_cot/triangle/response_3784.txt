Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes. To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify unique triangles by looking at the connections between nodes.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Nodes directly connected:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 7
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8

2. Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangles will be formed by nodes that are all connected to each other.

Based on the given connections, we can identify the following unique triangles:
- <1, 8, 9>
- <3, 8, 9>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
