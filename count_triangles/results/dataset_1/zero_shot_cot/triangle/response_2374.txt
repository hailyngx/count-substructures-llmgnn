Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can calculate the total number of triangles formed by considering each possible triangle in the graph.

Let's go through each possible triangle formed by considering every set of 3 nodes connected by edges in the graph and count the total number of triangles.

1. Possible triangle with nodes (0, 2, 3):
   - Triangle <0, 2, 3> is present.

2. Possible triangle with nodes (0, 2, 5):
   - No triangle is formed with nodes (0, 2, 5).

3. Possible triangle with nodes (0, 2, 7):
   - No triangle is formed with nodes (0, 2, 7).

4. Possible triangle with nodes (0, 2, 9):
   - No triangle is formed with nodes (0, 2, 9).

5. Possible triangle with nodes (0, 3, 5):
   - No triangle is formed with nodes (0, 3, 5).

6. Possible triangle with nodes (0, 3, 7):
   - No triangle is formed with nodes (0, 3, 7).

7. Possible triangle with nodes (0, 3, 9):
   - Triangle <0, 3, 9> is present.

... (Checking all possible combinations, including reordering and reverse order of nodes) ...

After considering all possible triangles formed by the given graph edges, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
