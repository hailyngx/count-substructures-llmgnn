Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we can examine each possible triangle formed by three nodes.

Nodes 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle.
Nodes 1, 4, and 6 form a triangle.
Nodes 1, 4, and 8 form a triangle.
Nodes 1, 6, and 4 form a triangle.
Nodes 2, 8, and 9 form a triangle.
Nodes 3, 1, and 5 form a triangle.
Nodes 4, 6, and 8 form a triangle.

Hence, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 3>, <1, 4, 6>, and <1, 4, 8>.
