Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <1, 5, 3>
4. <1, 7, 6>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <2, 3, 9>
7. <4, 0, 9>
8. <4, 3, 9>
9. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
