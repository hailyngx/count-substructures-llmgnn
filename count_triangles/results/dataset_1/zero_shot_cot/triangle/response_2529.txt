Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 3.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 6, 1)
- Triangle 2: (0, 6, 5)
- Triangle 3: (0, 1, 8)
- Triangle 4: (1, 4, 3)
- Triangle 5: (1, 6, 5)
- Triangle 6: (2, 5, 6)
- Triangle 7: (3, 4, 1)
- Triangle 8: (3, 4, 8)
- Triangle 9: (3, 8, 2)
- Triangle 10: (3, 8, 9)

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
