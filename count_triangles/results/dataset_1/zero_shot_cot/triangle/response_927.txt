Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
3. Triangle <4, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
