Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to check for each possible combination of three nodes if they form a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Here are the steps to find the number of triangles:

1. Identify all triangles:
   - Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
   - Edges given in pairs.
   
2. Check all possible triangles:
   - (0, 2, 5)
   - (0, 5, 8)
   - (2, 3, 7)
   - (4, 7, 8)
   - (5, 6, 9)
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, and <5, 6, 9>.
