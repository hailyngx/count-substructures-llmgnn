Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles present in the graph:

1. (0, 1, 2)
2. (0, 1, 4)
3. (0, 1, 9)
4. (0, 2, 4)
5. (0, 5, 8)
6. (1, 2, 4)
7. (1, 2, 9)
8. (1, 4, 9)
9. (2, 3, 4)
10. (2, 3, 9)
11. (3, 4, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles in the graph.
