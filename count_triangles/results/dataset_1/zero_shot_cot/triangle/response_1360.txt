Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the given edges. Below are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 4, 5>
4. <2, 6, 9>
5. <4, 5, 6>
6. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
