Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's analyze the graph step by step to identify the triangles:

1. From the given edges, we can see the following connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6.
- Node 1 is connected to node 4.
- Node 2 is connected to node 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to node 3.

2. Let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 3, 6>
- <4, 1, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
