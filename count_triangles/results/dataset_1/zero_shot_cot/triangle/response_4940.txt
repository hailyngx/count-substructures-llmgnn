Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 
After analyzing the given edges, the triangles in this graph are as follows:
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
[2]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
