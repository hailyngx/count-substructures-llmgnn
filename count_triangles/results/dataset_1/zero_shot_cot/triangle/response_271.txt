Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges described by the pairs provided, let's count the number of triangles.

After analyzing the graph, the triangles formed are:
1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <1, 2, 3>
3. <1, 2, 6>
4. <1, 3, 5>
5. <1, 6, 5>
6. <2, 3, 5>
7. <3, 5, 6>
8. <3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
