Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Triangles are formed when three nodes are connected in a closed loop.

Starting with each node:
- Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 6, and 9: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 6, 9>
- Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 0, 2, and 5: <0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <0, 1, 2>
- Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 5: <1, 2, 5>
- Node 3 does not form any triangles.
- Node 4 does not form any triangles.
- Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 2: <1, 2, 5>
- Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>
- Node 7 does not form any triangles.
- Node 8 does not form any triangles.
- Node 9 does not form any triangles.

Putting all the unique triangles together, we get:
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
