Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every possible group of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by identifying the triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
4. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
6. Triangle <4, 8, 9>
7. Triangle <5, 6, 7>
8. Triangle <6, 7, 9>
9. Triangle <6, 8, 9>
10. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

There are 10 triangles in total. So, the output is: [10].
