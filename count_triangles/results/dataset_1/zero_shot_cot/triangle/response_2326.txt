Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Each triangle consists of three vertices connected by edges, forming a closed loop.

Looking at the provided graph, the triangles present are:
1. <1, 4, 6>
2. <1, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
