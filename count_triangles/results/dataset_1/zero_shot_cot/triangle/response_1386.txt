Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all possible triangles formed by considering each triplet of nodes connected by edges.
2. Count the number of unique triangles found.
3. Output the total count of triangles.

Let's go through the graph provided and identify the triangles:

- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 6)
- Triangle 2: (0, 4, 6)
- Triangle 3: (0, 5, 6)
- Triangle 4: (1, 4, 6)
- Triangle 5: (4, 6, 7)
- Triangle 6: (6, 7, 8)
- Triangle 7: (6, 8, 7)

Hence, there are a total of 7 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
