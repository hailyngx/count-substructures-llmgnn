Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.

Let's list down the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 4. So, the output should be [4].
