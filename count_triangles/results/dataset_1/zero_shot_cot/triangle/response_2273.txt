Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for combinations of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

First, let's list out the triangles we find in the graph:
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <5, 7, 9>

After listing out the triangles, we can count how many unique triangles we found. The total number of triangles in this graph is [9].
