Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by the edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes connected by edges:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 9.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

2. Identify triangles:
   - Possible triangles involving node 0: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 1: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 2: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 3: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 4: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 5: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 6: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 7: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 8: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 9: <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <4, 6, 9>.
