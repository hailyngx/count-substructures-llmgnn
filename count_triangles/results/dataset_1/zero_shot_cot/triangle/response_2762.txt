Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible triangles formed by the edges provided.

Let's list the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <1, 8, 9>
6. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
