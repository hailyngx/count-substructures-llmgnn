Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a more visual way to better understand it:

```
0 --- 5            8
|      |          
|      |          
8      9---6       7
        \  |      
        \  |      
          4
```

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph step by step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 0.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.

Now, we identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: (0, 5, 9)
- Triangle 2: (1, 4, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
