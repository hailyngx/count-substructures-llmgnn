Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's determine the total number of triangles step-by-step:

1. List all triangles:
   - <0, 1, 5>
   - <0, 1, 9>
   - <1, 2, 6>
   - <1, 8, 9>
   - <1, 9, 6>
   - <2, 4, 6>
   - <9, 3, 4>
   - <9, 8, 1>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 8

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
