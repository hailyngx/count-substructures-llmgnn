Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles by examining each possible triangle
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 4, 0>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <7, 8, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles is [9].
