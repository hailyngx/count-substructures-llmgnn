Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles we can find:
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 7, 8>

Counting the unique triangles listed above, we have a total of 7 triangles in the graph.
So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
