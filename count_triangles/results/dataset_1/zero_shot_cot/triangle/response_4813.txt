Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles in the given graph:
1. (0, 2, 4)
2. (1, 3, 6)
3. (2, 3, 7)
4. (2, 4, 7)
5. (2, 5, 7)
6. (3, 6, 7)
7. (4, 7, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [7]
