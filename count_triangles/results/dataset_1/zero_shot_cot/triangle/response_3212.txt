Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of 3 nodes that are fully connected to each other.

From the given edges, the triangles in the graph are:
1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 5, 6>
3. <1, 5, 7>
4. <1, 6, 8>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <5, 6, 9>
7. <5, 7, 8>
8. <6, 9, 3>
9. <7, 4, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
