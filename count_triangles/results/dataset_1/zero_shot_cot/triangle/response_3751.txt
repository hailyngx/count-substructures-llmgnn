Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph.

First, we note that for a triangle to exist in a graph, there must be three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's list all the triangles present in the given graph:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - <0, 1, 2>
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <0, 2, 8>

2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - None

3. Triangles involving node 2:
   - None

4. Triangles involving node 3:
   - None

5. Triangles involving node 4:
   - None

6. Triangles involving node 5:
   - None

7. Triangles involving node 6:
   - None

8. Triangles involving node 7:
   - None

9. Triangles involving node 8:
   - None

10. Triangles involving node 9:
   - None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 3, and they are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 4>, and <0, 2, 8>. Hence, the output is [3].
