Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we can create an adjacency matrix to represent the given graph. The adjacency matrix for this graph is as follows:

```
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 |0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 |0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
2 |0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
3 |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
4 |1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
5 |0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
6 |0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
7 |0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
8 |0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
9 |0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
```

Next, to count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles that exist. Let's find the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <2, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <2, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 7, 3>
6. Triangle <4, 0, 8>
7. Triangle <5, 9, 6>
8. Triangle <3, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
