Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's start by listing out the triangles we can find in this graph:
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 2, 5>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [8].
