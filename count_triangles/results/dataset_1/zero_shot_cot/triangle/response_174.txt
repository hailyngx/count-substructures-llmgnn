Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 2>, <2, 1, 6>, <0, 7, 4>, <1, 2, 6>
