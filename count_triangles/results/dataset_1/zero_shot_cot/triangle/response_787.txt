Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we will determine the number of triangles present.

To count the number of triangles, we need to find the number of unique combinations of three vertices that form a triangle.

After analyzing the given edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph, as seen below:
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 4, 6>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
