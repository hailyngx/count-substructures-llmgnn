Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node
Node 0: Degree = 3
Node 1: Degree = 4
Node 2: Degree = 1
Node 3: Degree = 3
Node 4: Degree = 1
Node 5: Degree = 4
Node 6: Degree = 2
Node 7: Degree = 6
Node 8: Degree = 2
Node 9: Degree = 4

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles
To find the number of triangles, we need to consider all possible triangles using the given edges. We count a triangle whenever there is a connection between any three nodes.

The total number of triangles = 28 (edges) - 20 (triangles sharing 2 edges) = 8

Step 3: List the unique triangles
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 3, 7>
<7, 9, 5>
<8, 9, 5>
<9, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
