Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by 3 nodes connected to each other.

Let's list out the triangles present in the graph:

1. <3, 0, 4>
2. <3, 0, 8>
3. <3, 1, 6>
4. <3, 1, 8>
5. <3, 2, 4>
6. <4, 0, 2>
7. <4, 0, 7>
8. <4, 2, 6>
9. <4, 3, 6>
10. <8, 0, 5>
11. <8, 0, 9>
12. <8, 1, 9>
13. <8, 3, 5>
14. <8, 3, 9>

Count of triangles: [14]
