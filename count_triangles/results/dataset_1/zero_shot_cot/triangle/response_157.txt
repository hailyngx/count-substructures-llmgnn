Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. We can iterate through all possible triplets of nodes and check if they form a triangle by verifying if each pair of nodes in the triplet is connected by an edge.

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
