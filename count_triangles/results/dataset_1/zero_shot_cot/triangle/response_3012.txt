Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each possible triangle formed by the vertices and see if all the necessary edges are present. 

Here are the triangles found in the graph:  
<0, 1, 9>  
<1, 2, 4>  
<4, 5, 9>  

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
