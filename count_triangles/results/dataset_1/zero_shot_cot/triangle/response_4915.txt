Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we need to count the number of triangles.

To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we can follow this step-by-step process:

1. Look at each node and identify all the neighbors of that node.
2. Check for triangles among the neighbors of the node.
3. Repeat this process for all nodes in the graph.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
