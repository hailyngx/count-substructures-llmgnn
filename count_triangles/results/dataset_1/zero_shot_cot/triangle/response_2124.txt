Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected such that they form a triangle.

Let's list out the triangles step by step:
1. Triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 6, 9>
2. Triangles involving node 1: <1, 0, 3>
3. Triangles involving node 3: <3, 1, 7>
4. Triangles involving node 4: No triangles
5. Triangles involving node 5: No triangles
6. Triangles involving node 6: <6, 0, 8>
7. Triangles involving node 7: No triangles
8. Triangles involving node 8: No triangles
9. Triangles involving node 9: No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
