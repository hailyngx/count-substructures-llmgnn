Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each unique combination of nodes that form triangles. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to each other directly:
   - (0, 9) form a triangle with edges: (0, 9), (9, 4), (4, 0)  => <0, 9, 4>
  
2. Triangles formed by checking if there is an edge between the remaining nodes:
   - (1, 4) : No triangle
   - (3, 4) : No triangle
   - (3, 6) : No triangle
   - (3, 7) : No triangle
   - (3, 8) : No triangle
   - (4, 8) : No triangle
   - (4, 5) : No triangle
   - (4, 9) : No triangle
   - (5, 9) : No triangle
   - (6, 8) : No triangle
   - (7, 9) : No triangle
   - (8, 9) : No triangle
  
3. Calculating the total number of triangles:
   - There is only one triangle in the given graph: <0, 9, 4>
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **[1]**.
