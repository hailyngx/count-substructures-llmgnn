Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 6, 7>, and <6, 8, 9>.
