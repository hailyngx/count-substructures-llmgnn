Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes directly connected:
    - Triangle <0, 3, 7>
    - Triangle <0, 3, 9>
    - Triangle <0, 6, 7>
    - Triangle <0, 6, 9>
    - Triangle <3, 2, 5>
    - Triangle <3, 4, 9>
    - Triangle <2, 4, 5>

2. Triangles formed indirectly:
    - Triangle <0, 3, 2> (through <0, 3> and <2, 3>)
    - Triangle <0, 3, 5> (through <0, 3> and <2, 3>)
    - Triangle <0, 5, 2> (through <0, 3> and <2, 3> and <5, 3>)
    - Triangle <3, 4, 5> (through <3, 4> and <2, 4>)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
