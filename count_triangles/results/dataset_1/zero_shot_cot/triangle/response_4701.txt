Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph step by step.

1. First, identify all triangles formed by three nodes connected by edges.
2. Count the total number of such triangles.
3. List the unique triangles found.

Based on the provided edges, the triangles in the graph can be represented as follows:
<Edge 0, 4, 6>
<Edge 0, 6, 7>
<Edge 0, 6, 9>
<Edge 0, 7, 8>
<Edge 3, 5, 6>
<Edge 3, 6, 7>
<Edge 3, 6, 8>
<Edge 4, 5, 6>
<Edge 5, 6, 7>
<Edge 6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
