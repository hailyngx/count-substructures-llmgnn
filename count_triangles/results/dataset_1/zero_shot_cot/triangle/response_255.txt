Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to examine all possible 3-node combinations and check if they form a triangle. Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to each node:
   - Node 0: {5, 7}
   - Node 1: {5}
   - Node 2: {4, 6, 7}
   - Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
   - Node 4: {2, 8}
   - Node 5: {0, 1, 3}
   - Node 6: {2, 3, 9}
   - Node 7: {0, 2, 3}
   - Node 8: {3, 4}
   - Node 9: {3, 6}

2. Triangles found:
   - <0, 5, 7>
   - <2, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
