Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes.

Let's identify the triangles one by one:
1. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
