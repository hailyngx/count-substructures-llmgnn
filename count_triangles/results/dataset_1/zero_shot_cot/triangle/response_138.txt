Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given a graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we need to count the number of triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other.

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all pairwise connected. Let's examine each possible triangle:

1. Possible triangle involving node 0:
   - (0, 8), (0, 9), (8, 9) form a triangle <0, 8, 9>.

2. Possible triangle involving node 1:
   - No triangles involving node 1.

3. Possible triangle involving node 2:
   - No triangles involving node 2.

4. Possible triangle involving node 3:
   - (1, 3), (3, 8), (1, 8) form a triangle <1, 3, 8>.
   - (3, 4), (4, 7), (3, 7) form a triangle <3, 4, 7>.

5. Possible triangle involving node 4:
   - No triangles involving node 4.

6. Possible triangle involving node 5:
   - No triangles involving node 5.

7. Possible triangle involving node 6:
   - No triangles involving node 6.

8. Possible triangle involving node 7:
   - (2, 7), (2, 6), (6, 7) form a triangle <2, 6, 7>.

9. Possible triangle involving node 8:
   - (0, 8), (0, 9), (8, 9) form a triangle <0, 8, 9>.
   - (3, 8), (3, 9), (8, 9) form a triangle <3, 8, 9>.
   - (5, 8), (5, 7), (7, 8) form a triangle <5, 7, 8>.

10. Possible triangle involving node 9:
   - No triangles involving node 9.

After examining all possible triangles, we find that there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
