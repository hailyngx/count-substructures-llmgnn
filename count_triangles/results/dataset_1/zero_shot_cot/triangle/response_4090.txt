Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other (form a triangle).

Looking at the given graph, we can observe the following triangles:
1. <2, 6, 7>
2. <2, 6, 8>
3. <2, 7, 9>
4. <3, 5, 7>
5. <3, 6, 7>
6. <3, 7, 9>
7. <6, 7, 8>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
