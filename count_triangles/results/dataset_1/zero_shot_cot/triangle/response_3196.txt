Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every unique set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
