Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to check for each triplet of nodes whether they form a triangle by having edges between all three pairs. Let's list down the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 8, 9>
3. <2, 6, 7>
4. <4, 7, 9>

So, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
