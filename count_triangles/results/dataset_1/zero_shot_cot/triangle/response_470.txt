Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for cycles of length 3 (triangles). Let's analyze the graph step by step:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 4), (7, 2), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 9), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's find the triangles:
1. (0, 5, 4)
2. (3, 5, 4)
3. (3, 5, 0)
4. (9, 3, 5)
5. (9, 3, 4)
6. (9, 8, 2)
7. (9, 8, 7)
8. (9, 7, 2)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
