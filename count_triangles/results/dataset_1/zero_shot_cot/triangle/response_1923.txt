Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to check for each triplet of nodes whether they form a triangle or not.

In this case, we can notice that the triangles are formed by nodes 0, 2, and 3 and by nodes 4, 5, and 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and they are <0, 2, 3> and <4, 5, 9>.
