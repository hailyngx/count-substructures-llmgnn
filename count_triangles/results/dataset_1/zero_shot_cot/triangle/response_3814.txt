Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for cycles of length 3. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes connected to each other forming a cycle of length 3.

Let's identify the triangles present in the given graph:
1. Triangle: <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle: <0, 2, 8>
3. Triangle: <0, 4, 8>
4. Triangle: <1, 7, 8>
5. Triangle: <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
