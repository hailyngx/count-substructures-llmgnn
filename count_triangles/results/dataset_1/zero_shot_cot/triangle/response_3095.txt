Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
