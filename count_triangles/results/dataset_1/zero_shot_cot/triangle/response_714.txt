Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. We will identify triangles by finding nodes that are connected in a way that forms a cycle of length 3.

2. The triangles can be represented by unique combinations of 3 nodes.

3. Let's list out the triangles:
   - <0, 4, 6>
   - <0, 4, 1>
   - <0, 4, 2>
   - <1, 4, 6>
   - <1, 5, 2>
   - <2, 3, 6>
   - <2, 4, 5>
   - <2, 4, 8>
   - <4, 6, 9>
   - <5, 9, 2>

4. There are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
