Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly or indirectly through edges.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [7].
