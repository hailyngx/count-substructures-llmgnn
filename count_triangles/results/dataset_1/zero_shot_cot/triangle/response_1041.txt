Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for cycles of length 3 (triangles). Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 6, 4>
4. <0, 6, 7>
5. <0, 4, 7>
6. <1, 4, 6>
7. <6, 4, 7>
8. <2, 7, 4>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
