Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>

2. Triangles involving node 2:
   - Triangle 2: <0, 2, 4>

There are two unique triangles in this graph, which are <0, 2, 4>. Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
