Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6 which form a triangle.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7 which do not form a triangle.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7 which form a triangle.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7 which form triangles <0, 3, 4> and <3, 5, 7>.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7 which form triangles <1, 2, 4> and <2, 3, 4> and <3, 4, 7>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6 which do not form triangles.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5 which do not form a triangle.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 which form no new triangles.
9. Node 9 is connected to node 7 which does not form a triangle.

Count of triangles: [4]  
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 4>
