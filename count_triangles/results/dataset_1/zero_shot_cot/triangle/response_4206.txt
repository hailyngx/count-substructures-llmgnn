Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all pairwise connected. Let's identify the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 1, 4)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 1, 5)
3. Triangle 3: (0, 7, 4)
4. Triangle 4: (0, 7, 9)
5. Triangle 5: (1, 4, 7)
6. Triangle 6: (1, 4, 5)
7. Triangle 7: (1, 5, 9)
8. Triangle 8: (3, 5, 9)
9. Triangle 9: (7, 4, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph.

The total number of triangles is [9].
