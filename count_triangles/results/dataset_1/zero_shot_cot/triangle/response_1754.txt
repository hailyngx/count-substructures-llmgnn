Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Since we have 10 nodes labeled from 0 to 9, let's identify the triangles by examining all possible combinations of three nodes.

2. For each combination of three nodes, we will check if there are edges connecting all three nodes, forming a triangle.

3. List down the unique triangles found and count the total number of triangles.

Following the above steps, we find the following unique triangles in the graph:
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
