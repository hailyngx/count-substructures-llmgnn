Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
3. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
