Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will look for any set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. A triangle consists of three nodes where each node is directly connected to both of the other two nodes.

Here's the list of unique triangles found in this graph:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 9, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in this graph.
