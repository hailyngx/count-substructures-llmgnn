Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to check for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's go step-by-step in finding the triangles:

1. Triangle with nodes (0, 2, 3)
2. Triangle with nodes (0, 3, 4)
3. Triangle with nodes (0, 3, 8)
4. Triangle with nodes (1, 3, 5)
5. Triangle with nodes (1, 3, 6)
6. Triangle with nodes (1, 4, 5)
7. Triangle with nodes (1, 6, 7)
8. Triangle with nodes (3, 5, 7)
9. Triangle with nodes (3, 6, 7)
10. Triangle with nodes (6, 7, 9)

There are 10 triangles in total, and they can be represented as:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
