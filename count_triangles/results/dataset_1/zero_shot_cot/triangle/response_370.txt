Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph.
Here are the triangles in the given graph:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <3, 4, 6>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.
The total number of triangles is [4].
