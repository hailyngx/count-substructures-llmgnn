Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine all possible combinations of 3 nodes and check if they form a triangle by having edges connecting them.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
