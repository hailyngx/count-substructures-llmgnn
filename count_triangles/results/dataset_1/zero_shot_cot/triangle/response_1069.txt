Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by three nodes. Let's start by listing the triangles one by one:

1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 5, 6>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <2, 3, 5>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <3, 5, 6>
7. <3, 6, 8>
8. <5, 6, 8>
9. <5, 6, 9>

There are a total of 9 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
