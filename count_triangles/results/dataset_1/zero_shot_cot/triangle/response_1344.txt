Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's look for all possible triangles formed by the edges provided. I will list each unique triangle and then provide the total count in the end.

Unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <1, 4, 6>
3. <1, 6, 9>
4. <2, 1, 6>
5. <3, 5, 9>
6. <4, 5, 9>
7. <4, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [7]
