Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Nodes 0, 7, 4 form a triangle because:
   - (0, 7)
   - (0, 4)
   - (4, 7)

2. Nodes 1, 6, 9 form a triangle because:
   - (1, 6)
   - (1, 9)
   - (6, 9)

3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9, forming additional triangles:
   - Nodes 5, 3, 6
   - Nodes 5, 6, 7
   - Nodes 5, 6, 9
   - Nodes 5, 7, 9

Hence, the total number of triangles is 5, and the unique triangles found are <0, 7, 4>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, and <5, 7, 9>. Therefore, the answer is [5].
