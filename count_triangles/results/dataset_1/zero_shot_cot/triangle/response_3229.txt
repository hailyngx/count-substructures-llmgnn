Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all directly connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 7> is found.
   - Triangle <0, 4, 5> is found.
   - No more triangles with Node 0 as the starting node.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
   - No triangles are formed with Node 1 because it only has 2 connections.

3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
   - No triangles are formed with Node 4 because it only has 4 connections.

4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
   - No triangles are formed with Node 5 because it only has 3 connections.

5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
   - Triangle <0, 7, 1> is found.
   - Triangle <0, 7, 2> is found.
   - Triangle <0, 7, 5> is found.
   - Triangle <0, 7, 6> is found.
   - No more triangles with Node 7 as the starting node.

6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4.
   - No triangles are formed with Node 8 because it only has 2 connections.

7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7.
   - No triangles are formed with Node 9 because it only has 2 connections.

After considering all nodes, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6] as listed below:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 7, 6>.
