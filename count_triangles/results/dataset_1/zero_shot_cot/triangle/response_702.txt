Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triangles formed by paths of length 2. A triangle is formed when there are three nodes connected by edges to each other.

By observing the edges provided, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 7, 8>
4. <2, 5, 7>
5. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
