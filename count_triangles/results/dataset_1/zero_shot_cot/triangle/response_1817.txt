Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 9>.
