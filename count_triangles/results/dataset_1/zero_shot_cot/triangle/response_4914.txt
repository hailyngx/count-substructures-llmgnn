Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Identifying triangles:
1. <1, 2, 6>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <1, 7, 8>
4. <2, 6, 5>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <3, 4, 8>
7. <4, 8, 7>
8. <5, 3, 6>

Total number of triangles: [8]
