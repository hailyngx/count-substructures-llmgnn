Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed by three connected nodes.

Let's identify the triangles step by step:
1. Look for nodes that have edges to each other forming a triangle.

The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 9, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<8, 9, 5>
<8, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
