Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are connected by edges to form triangles.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <2, 5, 8>
2. <2, 5, 9>
3. <2, 8, 5>
4. <2, 8, 6>
5. <4, 8, 5>
6. <5, 8, 6>
7. <5, 8, 9>
8. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
