Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each set of three nodes to see if they form a triangle. A triangle is formed when each node is connected to the other two nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <1, 4, 6>
3. <2, 5, 6>
4. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
