Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the information provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Look for triangles by checking each possible combination of three nodes connected by edges.
2. Count the number of triangles formed by checking if each combination of three nodes forms a closed loop.

Calculating the number of triangles:

1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <3, 4, 6>
4. <3, 5, 9>
5. <4, 6, 5>
6. <4, 7, 5>
7. <5, 7, 6>
8. <7, 8, 5>
9. <7, 8, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is:
\[9\]
