Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
Triangle 2: (0, 5, 1)
Triangle 3: (0, 6, 8)
Triangle 4: (0, 7, 8)
Triangle 5: (2, 4, 2)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles. 

Total triangles = 5
