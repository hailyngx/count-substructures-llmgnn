Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>.
