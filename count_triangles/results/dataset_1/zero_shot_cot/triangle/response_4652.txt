Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we'll look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Letâ€™s list the triangles step-by-step:
1. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
6. Triangle <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
