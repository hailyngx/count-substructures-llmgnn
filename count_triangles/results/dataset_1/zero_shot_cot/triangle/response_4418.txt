Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for closed loops of length 3. In other words, we need to find sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list out the unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 9, 5>
<2, 0, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<1, 9, 4>
<1, 9, 5>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [6].
