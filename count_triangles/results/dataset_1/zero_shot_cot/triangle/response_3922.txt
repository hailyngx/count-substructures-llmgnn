Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in this graph. Here they are: 
<2, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
