Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. For each edge in the graph, look for two additional edges that would form a triangle with that edge.
2. Once you identify a triangle, list it inside angle brackets <>, and avoid listing duplicate triangles.

Let's go through the edges and identify the triangles:

Triangles:
1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <2, 5, 9>
3. <2, 6, 9>
4. <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
