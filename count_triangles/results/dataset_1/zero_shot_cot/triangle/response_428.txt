Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's start by listing all the triangles that can be formed using the given edges:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
4. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
7. Triangle <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
