Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Starting the triangle counting process:
1. Identify all triangles by checking for nodes that form a cycle of length 3.
2. List the unique triangles found. 

Let's begin identifying the triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 3>

So, the total number of triangles is [7].
