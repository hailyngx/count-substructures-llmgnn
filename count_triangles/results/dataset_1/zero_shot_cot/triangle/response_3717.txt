Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph based on the given edges:
- Triangle 1: (0, 6, 8)
- Triangle 2: (0, 6, 9)
- Triangle 3: (2, 4, 8)
- Triangle 4: (4, 8, 7)
- Triangle 5: (7, 8, 4)
- Triangle 6: (0, 8, 4)
- Triangle 7: (0, 4, 9)
- Triangle 8: (0, 6, 3)
- Triangle 9: (6, 3, 2)
- Triangle 10: (2, 3, 6)
- Triangle 11: (4, 2, 8)
  
Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [11]

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 8, 7>
<7, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 3>
<6, 3, 2>
<2, 3, 6>
<4, 2, 8>
