Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all pairwise connected. We will follow a systematic approach to do so:

1. Scan each node and find its neighbors.
2. For each pair of neighbors of a node, check if there is an edge between them to form a triangle.

Let's start the enumeration of the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
4. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
5. Triangle <1, 4, 6>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
7. Triangle <3, 6, 8>
8. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
9. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
10. Triangle <6, 7, 8>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
