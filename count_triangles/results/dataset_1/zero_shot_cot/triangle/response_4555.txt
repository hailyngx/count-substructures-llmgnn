Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's check for each possible triangle:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
   - Triangle: <0, 7, 8>

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9.
   - Triangles: <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>

3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
   - Triangle: <3, 4, 7>

4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
   - Triangle: <7, 0, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
