Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, so no triangles can be formed with node 0.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6. Possible triangles involving node 1 are <1, 3, 5> and <1, 5, 6>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8. So, no triangles can be formed with node 2.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4. Possible triangle involving node 3 is <1, 3, 4>.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 9. Possible triangles involving node 4 are <2, 4, 5> and <4, 5, 9>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, 9. Possible triangles involving node 5 are <1, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, and <5, 6, 9>.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, 9. Possible triangle involving node 6 is <5, 6, 9>.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8. So, no triangles can be formed with node 7.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 7. So, no triangles can be formed with node 8.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6. Possible triangle involving node 9 is <4, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. Unique triangles are <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 5>.
