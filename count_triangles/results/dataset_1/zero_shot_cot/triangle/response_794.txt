Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for cycles of length 3.

Let's go step-by-step to find the total number of triangles in this graph:
1. Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
2. Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
3. Node 2 has neighbor: 9
4. Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 5
5. Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 5
6. Node 5 has neighbors: 3, 4
7. Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 1, 8, 9
8. Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 1
9. Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 6
10. Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 2, 6

Based on the given edges, the triangles found in this graph are:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 6, 8>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <1, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
