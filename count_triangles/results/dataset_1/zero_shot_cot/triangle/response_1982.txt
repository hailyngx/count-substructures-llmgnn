Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can start by looking at each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes.

Let's list the unique triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
