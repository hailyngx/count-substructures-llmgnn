Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges. Triangles consist of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's find the triangles in this graph:

1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <1, 6, 9>
5. <2, 5, 9>
6. <6, 7, 9>
7. <3, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
