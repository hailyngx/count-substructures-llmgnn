Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Determine the Adjacency Matrix
The adjacency matrix for the given graph will be a 10x10 matrix where a value of 1 at position (i, j) indicates an edge between nodes i and j, and a value of 0 indicates no edge.

The adjacency matrix for the given graph is as follows:
```
   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
0  0  0  0  1  0  1  1  0  0  1
1  0  0  1  1  0  1  0  0  0  1
2  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
3  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
4  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1
5  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0
6  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0
7  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  1
8  0  0  0  0  1  0  1  0  0
