Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triplets of nodes that form a triangle, meaning every node is connected with every other node in the triplet.

Let's identify the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
2. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 7>

There are total [3] triangles in the given graph.
