Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's list the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
