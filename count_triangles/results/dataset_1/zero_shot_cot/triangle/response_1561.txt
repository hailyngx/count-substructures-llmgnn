Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected in the form of triangles.
Let's count the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
3. Triangle <2, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
