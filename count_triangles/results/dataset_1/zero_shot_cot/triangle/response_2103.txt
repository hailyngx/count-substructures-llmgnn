Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify triangles:
- Nodes involved in a triangle share edges between them.
- For example, if nodes A, B, and C form a triangle, there should be edges between A and B, B and C, and C and A.

2. Count the number of triangles:
- From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
  - <0, 2, 4>
  - <0, 8, 7>
  - <0, 8, 9>
  - <2, 0, 4>
  - <2, 3, 5>
  - <2, 3, 9>
  - <3, 5, 9>
  - <4, 6, 7>
  - <7, 6, 8>
  - <8, 7, 9>

3. Calculate the total number of triangles:
- There are 10 unique triangles listed above.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
