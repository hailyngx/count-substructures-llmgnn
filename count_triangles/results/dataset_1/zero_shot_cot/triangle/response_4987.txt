Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other in some way. Since we are given the list of edges, we can identify the triangles based on the connections between nodes.

Let's identify the triangles present in the graph:
1. Triangle <2, 3, 4>
2. Triangle <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
