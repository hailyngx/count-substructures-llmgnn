Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle shape. To do this, we will consider each node pair and check if there is a third node that connects to both of them.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 2>
<2, 4, 0>
<2, 5, 1>
<2, 8, 3>
<3, 4, 0>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 8, 2>
<4, 6, 0>
<4, 9, 1>
<6, 0, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
