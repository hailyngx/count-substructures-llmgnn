Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
