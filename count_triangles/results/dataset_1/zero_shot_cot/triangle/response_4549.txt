Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle.
2. A triangle is formed when there is an edge between every pair of the three nodes in the triplet.

Running through the nodes, we find the following unique triangles:

<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
