Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected with each other. 

Looking at the provided list of edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <5, 0, 1>
2. Triangle <5, 7, 8>
3. Triangle <5, 8, 7>
4. Triangle <5, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
