Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes connected by edges. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
4. Triangle <0, 5, 4>
5. Triangle <1, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
