Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By examining the given edges:
- Edge (0, 3) connects nodes 0 and 3.
- Edge (0, 7) connects nodes 0 and 7.
- Edge (0, 8) connects nodes 0 and 8.
- Edge (2, 6) connects nodes 2 and 6.
- Edge (2, 7) connects nodes 2 and 7.
- Edge (3, 4) connects nodes 3 and 4.
- Edge (3, 5) connects nodes 3 and 5.
- Edge (4, 5) connects nodes 4 and 5.
- Edge (5, 6) connects nodes 5 and 6.
- Edge (6, 8) connects nodes 6 and 8.
- Edge (7, 8) connects nodes 7 and 8.

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
2. Triangle <2, 6, 7>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
