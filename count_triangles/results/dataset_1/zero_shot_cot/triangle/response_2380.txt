Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There is a total of 2 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles are: 
<0, 1, 5>
<6, 3, 2> 

So, the total number of triangles is [2].
