Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 9, 5>
<1, 9, 7>
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 1, 9>
<2, 7, 5>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<9, 4, 5>
<9, 7, 5>
<9, 6, 0>
<9, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
