Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Look for all possible triangles formed by connecting three nodes:
- Triangle 1: (0, 4, 9)
- Triangle 2: (1, 2, 6)
- Triangle 3: (1, 2, 7)
- Triangle 4: (1, 2, 8)
- Triangle 5: (2, 4, 7)
- Triangle 6: (2, 9, 4)
- Triangle 7: (4, 7, 9)

2. Count the total number of triangles found. 

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 9, 4>, <4, 7, 9>.
