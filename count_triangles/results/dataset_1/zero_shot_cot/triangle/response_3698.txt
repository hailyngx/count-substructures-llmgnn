Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the triangles in the graph. A triangle consists of three nodes connected by edges. We can identify triangles by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular manner.

The possible triangles in this graph are:
1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 5, and 6
2. Triangle involving nodes 0, 7, and 8
3. Triangle involving nodes 2, 5, and 6
4. Triangle involving nodes 2, 7, and 8
5. Triangle involving nodes 7, 8, and 9

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
