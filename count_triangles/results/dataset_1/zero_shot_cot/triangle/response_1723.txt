Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, and <6, 9, 7>.
