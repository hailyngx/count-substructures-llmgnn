Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <4, 6, 9>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
