Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph to count the total number of triangles.

1. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <4, 7, 9>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
