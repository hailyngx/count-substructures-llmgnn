Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 2>
3. Triangle <1, 8, 6>
4. Triangle <1, 9, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 1>
6. Triangle <4, 5, 0>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 1>
8. Triangle <4, 5, 0>
9. Triangle <6, 8, 1>
10. Triangle <6, 9, 1>
11. Triangle <9, 2, 4>
12. Triangle <9, 6, 1>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
