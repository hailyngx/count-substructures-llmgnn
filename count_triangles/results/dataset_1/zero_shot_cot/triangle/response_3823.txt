Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are interconnected.

Let's go through the possible triangles step by step and list them:
1. Nodes 0, 1, 4 <0, 1, 4>
2. Nodes 0, 5, 6 <0, 5, 6>
3. Nodes 0, 5, 9 <0, 5, 9>
4. Nodes 0, 7, 4 <0, 4, 7>
5. Nodes 1, 4, 6 <1, 4, 6>
6. Nodes 1, 9, 5 <1, 5, 9>
7. Nodes 4, 6, 5 <4, 5, 6>
8. Nodes 5, 6, 9 <5, 6, 9>
9. Nodes 7, 4, 6 <4, 6, 7>
10. Nodes 7, 4, 9 <4, 7, 9>
11. Nodes 7, 9, 5 <5, 7, 9>

There are 11 unique triangles in the given graph. Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
