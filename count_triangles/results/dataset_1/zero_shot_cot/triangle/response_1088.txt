Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles formed in the graph by looking at the connections between the nodes:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 0, 3>
5. Triangle <2, 0, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
7. Triangle <3, 1, 9>
8. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
9. Triangle <4, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
