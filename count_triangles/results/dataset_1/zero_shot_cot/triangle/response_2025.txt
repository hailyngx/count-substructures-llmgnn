Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
By using the given graph, we can list all the unique triangles as follows:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
