Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by three nodes connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: [4, 9]
- Node 1: [4, 8]
- Node 2: [3]
- Node 3: [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]
- Node 4: [0, 1, 3]
- Node 5: [3, 6]
- Node 6: [3, 5, 9]
- Node 7: [3]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [0, 3, 6]

2. Possible triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 1>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 3>
- Triangle 3: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle 4: <0, 9, 6>
- Triangle 5: <1, 4, 3>
- Triangle 6: <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle 7: <3, 4, 6>
- Triangle 8: <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle 9: <3, 5, 6>
- Triangle 10: <3, 6, 9>

The total number of triangles is [10].
