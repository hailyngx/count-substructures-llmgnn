Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the steps to find the triangles:

1. Look for each node that has at least two edges connecting to other nodes.
2. Find all possible combinations of three nodes connected to each other forming triangles.

Let's find the triangles in this graph:

The nodes with at least two edges:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 2.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 7, 8.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 9.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 9.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, 8.

Possible triangles:
1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <1, 7, 9>
4. <2, 3, 4>
5. <4, 7, 9>
6. <4, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
