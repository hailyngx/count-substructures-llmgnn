Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <2, 3, 4>
2. <5, 6, 7>
3. <5, 7, 9>
4. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
