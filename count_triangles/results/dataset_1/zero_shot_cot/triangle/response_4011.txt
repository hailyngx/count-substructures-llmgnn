Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. First, let's check each triplet of nodes:
   - Triangles involving Node 0: None
   - Triangles involving Node 1: <0, 1, 5>, <1, 3, 4>
   - Triangles involving Node 2: None
   - Triangles involving Node 3: <1, 3, 5>, <4, 3, 7>, <5, 3, 7>, <5, 3, 9>
   - Triangles involving Node 4: <1, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 7>
   - Triangles involving Node 5: <0, 1, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>
   - Triangles involving Node 6: None
   - Triangles involving Node 7: <3, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 9>
   - Triangles involving Node 8: None
   - Triangles involving Node 9: <1, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 9>

2. Counting the total number of triangles: [11]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 11.
