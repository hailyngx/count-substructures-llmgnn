Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's start by listing all the triangles that we can form using the nodes and edges provided:

1. Triangle involving nodes 1, 3, and 8:
   - <1, 3, 8>

2. Triangle involving nodes 2, 3, and 5:
   - <2, 3, 5>

3. Triangle involving nodes 3, 5, and 7:
   - <3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
