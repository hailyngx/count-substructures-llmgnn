Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 1)
- Triangle 2: (0, 3, 5)
- Triangle 3: (0, 4, 9)
- Triangle 4: (2, 1, 3)
- Triangle 5: (2, 1, 5)
- Triangle 6: (2, 5, 8)
- Triangle 7: (2, 5, 9)
- Triangle 8: (2, 8, 9)
- Triangle 9: (3, 1, 5)
- Triangle 10: (6, 7, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 1, 3>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 1, 5>, and <6, 7, 9>.
