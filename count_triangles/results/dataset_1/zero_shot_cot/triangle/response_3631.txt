Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 8>.
