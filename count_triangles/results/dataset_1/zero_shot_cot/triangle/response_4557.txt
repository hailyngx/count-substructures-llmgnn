Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
It seems there are 10 nodes and 28 edges in the graph you provided. To count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Identify all triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other forming a closed loop of length 3.
2. List all unique triangles found and count them.

From the given edges, the triangles in the graph are:
1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <2, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
