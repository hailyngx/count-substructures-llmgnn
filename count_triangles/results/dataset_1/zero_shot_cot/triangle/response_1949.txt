Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles, we can look for each unique set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list out the triangles we can find in this graph:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <3, 4, 7>
6. <5, 7, 8>
7. <1, 5, 8>
8. <2, 4, 6>
9. <2, 4, 9>
10. <0, 6, 9>
11. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [11].
