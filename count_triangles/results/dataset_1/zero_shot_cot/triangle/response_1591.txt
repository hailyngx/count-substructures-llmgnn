Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
5. Triangle <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
