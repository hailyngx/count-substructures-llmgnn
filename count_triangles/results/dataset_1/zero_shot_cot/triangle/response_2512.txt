Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
From the given graph, we can find the following triangles:
1. <1, 2, 8>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <1, 6, 0>
4. <1, 6, 8>
5. <2, 1, 6>
6. <2, 6, 0>
7. <2, 6, 9>
8. <6, 0, 8>
9. <6, 1, 8>
10. <8, 6, 9>
11. <8, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
