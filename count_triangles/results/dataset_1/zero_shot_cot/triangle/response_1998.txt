Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided.

Let's list down the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <1, 7, 9>
6. <2, 4, 6>
7. <2, 5, 6>
8. <2, 5, 9>
9. <3, 4, 8>
10. <3, 7, 9>
11. <4, 6, 5>
12. <4, 6, 0>
13. <5, 6, 0>
14. <5, 9, 7>
15. <7, 8, 3>
16. <7, 9, 0>

There are a total of [16] triangles in the given graph.
