Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Starting by counting the number of triangles:

Nodes 0, 4, and 5 form a triangle because (0, 4), (0, 5), and (4, 5) are edges.
Nodes 0, 3, and 5 form a triangle because (0, 3), (0, 5), and (3, 5) are edges.
Nodes 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle because (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3) are edges.
Nodes 1, 3, and 4 form a triangle because (1, 3), (1, 4), and (3, 4) are edges.
Nodes 4, 5, and 9 form a triangle because (4, 5), (4, 9), and (5, 9) are edges.
Nodes 6, 8, and 9 form a triangle because (6, 8), (6, 9), and (8, 9) are edges.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in total in the given graph.

List of unique triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 4>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [6].
