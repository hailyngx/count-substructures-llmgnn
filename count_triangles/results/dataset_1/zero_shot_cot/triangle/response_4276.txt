Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triplets of nodes that are all connected to each other.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [\<0, 4, 8\> <1, 4, 8> <1, 5, 8>] = [3].
