Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:
1. Triangle 1: (0, 4, 3)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 3, 8)
3. Triangle 3: (2, 7, 8)
4. Triangle 4: (3, 4, 7)
5. Triangle 5: (5, 8, 9)

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the total number of triangles is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 3>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, and <5, 8, 9>.
