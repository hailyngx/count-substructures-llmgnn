Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the triangles in the given graph:

1. Nodes (0, 1, 2)
2. Nodes (0, 2, 8)
3. Nodes (0, 4, 9)
4. Nodes (2, 3, 5)
5. Nodes (4, 5, 7)
6. Nodes (5, 7, 9)
7. Nodes (8, 9, 2)

There are a total of [7] triangles in the graph.
