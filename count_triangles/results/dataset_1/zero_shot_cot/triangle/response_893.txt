Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three vertices that are all connected to each other.

Let's start by listing the triangles we find in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <3, 5, 7>
5. <3, 8, 4>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
