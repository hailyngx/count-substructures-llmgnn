Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's look for all possible triangles based on the given edges:
- Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8 (since it has edges with all of them) 
- Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 6 (since it has edges with both of them) 
- Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 0, 1, and 8 (since it has edges with all of them) 
- Node 3 and node 4 do not form any triangles with other nodes.
- Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9 (since it has edges with both of them)
- Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 8, and with nodes 8 and 9 (since it has edges with both pairs) 
- Node 7 does not form any triangles with other nodes.
- Node 8 forms triangles with nodes 0, 2, and 6 (since it has edges with all of them) 
- Node 9 does not form any triangles with other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 7. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>.

So, the final answer is: [7].
