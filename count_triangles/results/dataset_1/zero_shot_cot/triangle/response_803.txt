Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step and identify the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 1, 7>
4. <0, 4, 3>
5. <0, 5, 7>
6. <1, 3, 9>
7. <3, 4, 8>
8. <5, 6, 8>

Now, let's put these unique triangles in brackets and provide the total count of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [8]
