Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can go through all possible triangles using the given edges. 

Let's count the triangles step by step:
1. Check each possible triangle formed by the nodes:
   - For triangle <0, 1, 4>: (0, 4), (0, 1), (1, 4) are present.
   - For triangle <0, 1, 5>: (0, 5), (0, 1), (1, 5) are not present.
   - For triangle <0, 2, 5>: (0, 5), (0, 2), (2, 5) are present.
   - For triangle <1, 3, 4>: (1, 4), (1, 3), (3, 4) are present.
   - For triangle <2, 5, 9>: (2, 5), (2, 9), (5, 9) are not present.
   - For triangle <3, 4, 5>: (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5) are present.
   - For triangle <3, 5, 6>: (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 6) are present.
   - For triangle <6, 7, 8>: (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8) are not present.

2. Count the total number of triangles: 3
3. List the unique triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <3, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
