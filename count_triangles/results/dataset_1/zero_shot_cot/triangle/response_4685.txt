Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 3, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
