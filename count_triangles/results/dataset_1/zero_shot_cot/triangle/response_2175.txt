Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

Let's evaluate each possible triangle:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph: [<0, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 9>]. So, the total number of triangles is [3].
