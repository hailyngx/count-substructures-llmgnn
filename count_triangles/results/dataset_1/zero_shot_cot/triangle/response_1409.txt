Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Here is a list of nodes connected to each other:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's find the triangles:
1. Triangle: <0, 8, 9>
2. Triangle: <1, 3, 5>
3. Triangle: <1, 3, 8>
4. Triangle: <1, 7, 3>
5. Triangle: <2, 6, 4>
6. Triangle: <2, 6, 9>
7. Triangle: <4, 6, 8>
8. Triangle: <4, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [8]
