Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Count the number of triangles using the adjacency matrix method.
```
The adjacency matrix for the given graph:
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0   0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
1   0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
2   0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
3   0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
4   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
5   1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
6   0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
7   1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
8   0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
9   0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0

The total number of triangles can be found by calculating the trace of A^3 (cubed adjacency matrix).
```

Step 2: Calculate A^3 and find the trace.
```
A^3 = 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0   0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
2   0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
3   0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
4   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
5   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
6   0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
7   0 0 0 0 0
