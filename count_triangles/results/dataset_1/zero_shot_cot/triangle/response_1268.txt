Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Start by listing all the triangles in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 6>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 6, 0>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 6: <2, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 7: <4, 0, 2>
   - Triangle 8: <4, 5, 2>
   - Triangle 9: <5, 2, 4>
   - Triangle 10: <5, 4, 8>
   - Triangle 11: <6, 0, 1>
   - Triangle 12: <8, 1, 6>

2. Now, count the total number of unique triangles:
   - Total number of unique triangles: 9

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
