Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the total number of triangles in the graph by examining each unique set of three nodes that form a triangle.

Step 2: Identify the unique triangles present in the graph.

Let's start by listing the unique triangles:
1. (0, 1, 8)
2. (0, 2, 5)
3. (0, 2, 8)
4. (0, 7, 3)
5. (2, 5, 9)
6. (2, 8, 9)
7. (3, 5, 7)
8. (5, 7, 9)
9. (8, 4, 6)
10. (8, 6, 9)

There are 10 unique triangles in total. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
