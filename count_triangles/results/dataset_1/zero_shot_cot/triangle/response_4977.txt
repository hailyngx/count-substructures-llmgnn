Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find all triangles in the graph by identifying all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Nodes connected to each other:
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 2, 6

Now, let's list down the triangles:
1. <1, 2, 7>
2. <2, 7, 8>
3. <2, 7, 9>
4. <2, 8, 7>
5. <2, 8, 9>
6. <2, 9, 6>
7. <7, 8, 2>
8. <7, 8, 9>
9. <8, 9, 2>

Total number of triangles found: [9]
