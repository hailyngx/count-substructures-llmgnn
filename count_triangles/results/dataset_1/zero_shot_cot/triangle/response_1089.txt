Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each possible triangle formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other, completing a triangular shape.

In this case, we observe the following unique triangles:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 6, 2>
4. <0, 7, 3>
5. <1, 5, 9>
6. <2, 5, 6>
7. <2, 6, 8>
8. <3, 7, 9>
9. <4, 7, 8>
10. <5, 6, 9>
11. <8, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
