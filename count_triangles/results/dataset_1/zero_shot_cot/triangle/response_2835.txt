Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, let's find the number of triangles present:

1. Look for nodes connected by a total of three edges to form triangles:
   - Nodes 0, 2, 5 form a triangle. Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
   - Nodes 2, 6, 7 form a triangle. Triangle 2: <2, 6, 7>
   - Nodes 2, 5, 7 form a triangle. Triangle 3: <2, 5, 7>
   - Nodes 7, 8, 9 form a triangle. Triangle 4: <7, 8, 9>

Thus, there are 4 triangles in total [4] in the given graph.
