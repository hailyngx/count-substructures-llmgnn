Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.
