Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Calculate the triangles formed by each node:
   - Node 0: No triangles.
   - Node 1: No triangles.
   - Node 2: Triangles <0, 2, 1> and <0, 2, 6>.
   - Node 3: No triangles.
   - Node 4: No triangles.
   - Node 5: No triangles.
   - Node 6: Triangles <1, 6, 2> and <4, 6, 7>.
   - Node 7: No triangles.
   - Node 8: No triangles.
   - Node 9: No triangles.

2. Count the total number of unique triangles found: [2]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
