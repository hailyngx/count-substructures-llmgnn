Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for combinations of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - Triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 6>

2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - No triangles involving node 1.

3. Triangles involving node 2:
   - No triangles involving node 2.

4. Triangles involving node 3:
   - No triangles involving node 3.

5. Triangles involving node 4:
   - No triangles involving node 4.

6. Triangles involving node 5:
   - No triangles involving node 5.

7. Triangles involving node 6:
   - Triangles: <0, 6, 5>

8. Triangles involving node 7:
   - No triangles involving node 7.

9. Triangles involving node 8:
   - No triangles involving node 8.

10. Triangles involving node 9:
   - No triangles involving node 9.

Adding up the identified triangles, we have found a total of [3] triangles in the given graph: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 5>.
