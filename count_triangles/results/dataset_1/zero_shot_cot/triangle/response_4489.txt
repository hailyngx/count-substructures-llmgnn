Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 8, 9>.
