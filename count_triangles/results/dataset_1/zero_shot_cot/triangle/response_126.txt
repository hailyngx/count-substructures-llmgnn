Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles:
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 3, 7>

So, the total number of triangles is [2].
