Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify the triangles present by examining each possible combination of three connected nodes.

The triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 8, 3>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 1>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
