Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify triangles from the given edges
Triangles can be formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles based on the given edges:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles
Total number of triangles: [4]
