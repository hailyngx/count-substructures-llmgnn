Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes 0, 4, and 7 form a triangle <0, 4, 7>.
2. Nodes 5, 6, and 7 form a triangle <5, 6, 7>.
3. Nodes 2, 5, and 7 form a triangle <2, 5, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
