Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
