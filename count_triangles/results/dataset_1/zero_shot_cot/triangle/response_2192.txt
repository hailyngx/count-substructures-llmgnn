Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 8, 4>, <5, 6, 8>.
