Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <1, 3, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 6, 8>
6. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
7. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
8. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
9. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
10. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
11. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
12. Triangle <4, 6, 8>
13. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
14. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

There are a total of 14 triangles in this graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [14].
