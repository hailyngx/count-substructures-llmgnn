Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- <0, 7, 5>
- <0, 7, 6>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <2, 8, 5>
- <2, 9, 5>
- <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
