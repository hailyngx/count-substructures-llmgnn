Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Looking at the edges given:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to node 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph. By counting the triangles manually, we can see that there are 4 triangles in total. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 2>
<7, 8, 6>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
