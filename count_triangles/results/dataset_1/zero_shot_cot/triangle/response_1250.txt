Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we can identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other in some way. Let's go ahead and list the unique triangles we can find in this graph:

1. <1, 0, 6>
2. <1, 0, 9>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <1, 7, 8>
5. <1, 8, 4>
6. <6, 0, 9>
7. <6, 7, 9>
8. <7, 3, 2>
9. <7, 3, 6>
10. <7, 3, 9>
11. <7, 6, 9>
12. <7, 8, 4>
13. <7, 8, 1>
14. <7, 8, 9>
15. <9, 6, 0>
16. <9, 6, 7>
17. <9, 7, 8>
18. <9, 7, 1>

Having listed all the unique triangles, we can now count the total number of triangles in this graph. Thus, the answer is [18].
