Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's check all the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 5, 6>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph.
