Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. 

Let's start by listing all the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
