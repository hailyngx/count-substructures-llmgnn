Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 8, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 9, 1>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
6. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 6, 9>
8. Triangle <4, 1, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
