Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by sets of 3 nodes connected by edges.

Let's identify the triangles present in the given graph:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <2, 3, 6>
5. <2, 7, 8>
6. <2, 7, 9>
7. <2, 8, 9>
8. <3, 6, 8>
9. <4, 6, 9>
10. <5, 2, 7>
11. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in total in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [11].
