Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to check for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list all the unique triangles found in this graph:
<0, 1, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
