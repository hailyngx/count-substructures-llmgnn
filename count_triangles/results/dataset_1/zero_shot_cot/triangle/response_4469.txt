Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, we can determine the total number of triangles by checking each possible set of three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

By examining the graph, we can find the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
