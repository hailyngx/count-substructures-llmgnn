Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
By examining the given graph, we can count the number of triangles. Let's list the triangles one by one:

1. <1, 0, 2>
2. <1, 5, 2>
3. <1, 8, 5>
4. <1, 9, 4>
5. <1, 9, 5>
6. <2, 0, 6>
7. <2, 5, 0>
8. <5, 9, 1>
9. <5, 9, 8>
10. <6, 0, 3>
11. <6, 8, 5>
12. <6, 9, 8>
13. <9, 1, 4>
14. <9, 8, 5>
15. <9, 8, 6>

There are a total of 15 unique triangles in this graph. Therefore, the number of triangles is [15].
