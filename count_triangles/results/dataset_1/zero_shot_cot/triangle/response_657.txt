Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more readable format:

Node 0: 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 1: 2, 9
Node 2: 0, 1, 3
Node 3: 2, 8
Node 4: 5, 6
Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 5, 6
Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6
Node 9: 0, 1, 5

Now, let's count the number of triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

1. Possible triangles involving node 0: (0, 2, 1), (0, 2, 6), (0, 2, 8), (0, 2, 9), (0, 6, 4), (0, 6, 5), (0, 6, 8), (0, 6, 9)
2. Possible triangles involving node 1: (1, 2, 9)
3. Possible triangles involving node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 6), (2, 0, 8), (2, 0, 9), (2, 1, 9)
4. Possible triangles involving node 3: None
5. Possible triangles involving node 4: None
6. Possible triangles involving node 5: (5, 4, 6)
7. Possible triangles involving node 6: (6, 0, 4), (6, 0, 5), (6, 0, 8), (6, 0, 9), (6, 4, 5), (6, 4, 8), (6, 4, 9), (6, 5, 8), (6, 5, 9), (6, 8, 5), (6, 8, 9), (6, 5, 7)
8. Possible triangles involving node 7: None
9. Possible triangles involving node 8: (8, 0, 3), (8, 0, 5), (8, 0, 6), (8, 3, 2), (8, 3, 5), (8, 3, 8), (8, 5, 6), (8, 5, 7), (8, 5, 9), (8, 6, 5), (8, 6, 7), (8, 6, 9)
10. Possible triangles involving node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 0, 5), (9, 1, 2), (9, 1, 5), (9, 5, 4), (9, 5, 6)

Therefore, the number of triangles is 3, and they are:
<0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 5>, <5, 6, 8>
