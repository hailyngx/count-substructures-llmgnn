Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, you can find the number of triangles and list them as follows:

1. There are a total of 4 triangles in this graph. Here are the unique triangles:
   - <1, 3, 4>
   - <1, 6, 8>
   - <5, 0, 9>
   - <8, 6, 1>
