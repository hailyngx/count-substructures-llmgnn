Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: It's given that the graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. Let's draw the graph first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- 2: 1, 6
- 3: 0, 1, 4
- 4: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- 5: 4
- 6: 0, 1, 2, 9
- 7: 0, 1
- 8: 1, 4
- 9: 0, 4, 6

Now, let's identify the triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. We will find all unique triangles:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 4, 9>
3. Triangle 3: <1, 3, 4>
4. Triangle 4: <1, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [4]
