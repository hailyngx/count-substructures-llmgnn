Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given graph:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 4), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6).

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in this graph: [6]

Unique triangles:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <1, 5, 7>
5. <1, 6, 9>
6. <3, 5, 7>
