Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Look for triangles formed by each node in the graph.
2. Count the triangles formed by the nodes.
3. List the unique triangles found.

Let's start with step 1:

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 8. Check if there is an edge between nodes 6 and 8. If yes, then a triangle is formed with node 0.

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7. Check if there are edges between these nodes to form triangles.

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 9. Check for edges to form triangles.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4. Check for edges to form triangles.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has connections to node 3. Check for an edge.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to node 1. Check for an edge.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 1. Check for edges.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9. Check for edges.

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to node 0. Check for an edge.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 7. Check for edges.

By checking all possible triangles using the given edges, we can find the total number of triangles. Let's now go through the graph to find the triangles.
