Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go through the edges to identify the triangles:
1. Triangle: <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangle: <1, 2, 5>
3. Triangle: <1, 7, 5>
4. Triangle: <1, 2, 6>
5. Triangle: <2, 6, 7>
6. Triangle: <3, 7, 0>
7. Triangle: <7, 6, 9>
8. Triangle: <7, 6, 8>

From the identified triangles, we can see that there are 8 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
