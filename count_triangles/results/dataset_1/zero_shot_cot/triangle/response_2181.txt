Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Starting with each node, identify all triangles formed by considering each unique combination of three nodes. A triangle is formed if each pair of nodes is connected by an edge. 

Node 0:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 4: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 5: <0, 3, 7>

Node 1:
- No triangles with other nodes.

Node 2:
- Triangle 6: <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle 7: <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle 8: <2, 7, 9>

Node 3:
- Triangle 9: <3, 5, 0>
- Triangle 10: <3, 5, 7>
- Triangle 11: <3, 0, 4>

Node 4:
- No triangles with other nodes.

Node 5:
- Triangle 12: <5, 0, 4>
- Triangle 13: <5, 0, 6>
- Triangle 14: <5, 0, 7>
- Triangle 15: <5, 3, 7>

Node 6:
- Triangle 16: <6, 0, 7>

Node 7:
- Triangle 17: <7, 0, 1>
- Triangle 18: <7, 0, 2>
- Triangle 19: <7, 2, 9>

Node 8:
- No triangles with other nodes.

Node 9:
- No triangles with other nodes.

Total number of triangles inside brackets: [19]
