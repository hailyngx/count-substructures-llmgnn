Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
     - Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9.
       - We have a triangle <3, 7, 9>.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, and 8.
     - We have triangles <0, 3, 5> and <5, 7, 9>.
   - No triangles involving node 0.
  
2. Node 1 is connected to node 9.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7.
     - We have a triangle <1, 9, 7>.

3. Node 2 is connected to node 5.
   - Node 5 is already considered above, so no new triangles are formed with node 2.

4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
   - Node 5 is already considered above, so no new triangles are formed with node 6.
  
5. Node 8 is connected to node 5.
   - Node 5 is already considered above, so no new triangles are formed with node 8.

So, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
