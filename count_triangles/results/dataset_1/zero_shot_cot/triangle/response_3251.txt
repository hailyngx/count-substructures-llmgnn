Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <2, 4, 6>
4. <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the graph.
