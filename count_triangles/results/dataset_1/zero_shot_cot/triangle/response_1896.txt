Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all the triangles formed by three connected nodes.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.
3. Output the total number of triangles.

Let's go ahead and find the total number of triangles.
  
The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<8, 4, 9>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
