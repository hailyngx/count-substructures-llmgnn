Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are interconnected to each other. Let's list all the triangles we find:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <1, 5, 6>
4. <5, 3, 6>
5. <9, 4, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
