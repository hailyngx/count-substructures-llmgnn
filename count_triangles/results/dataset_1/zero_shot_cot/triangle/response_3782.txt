Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [2].

The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 8> and <3, 4, 9>.
