Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's analyze the graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {3, 4}
2. Nodes connected to node 1: {3, 4}
3. Nodes connected to node 2: {3, 4, 5, 6}
4. Nodes connected to node 3: {0, 1, 2, 9}
5. Nodes connected to node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
6. Nodes connected to node 5: {2, 6, 7, 8}
7. Nodes connected to node 6: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
8. Nodes connected to node 7: {5, 6, 8, 9}
9. Nodes connected to node 8: {5, 6, 7}
10. Nodes connected to node 9: {3, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <3, 4, 6>
2. <4, 6, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles in the graph, we have found 2 unique triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
