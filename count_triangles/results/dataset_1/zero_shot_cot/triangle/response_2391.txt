Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the triangles
- A triangle exists when three nodes are connected in a closed loop.
- Go through each combination of three nodes and check if they form a closed loop.

Step 2: List down the triangles
- We will list down the unique triangles found.

Here are the unique triangles found:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 8>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles
- There are 8 unique triangles found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
