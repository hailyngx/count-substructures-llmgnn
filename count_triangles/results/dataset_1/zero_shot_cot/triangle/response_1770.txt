Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>.
