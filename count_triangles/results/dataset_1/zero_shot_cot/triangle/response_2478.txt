Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in this graph. They are:

<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [6].
