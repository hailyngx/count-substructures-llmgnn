Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
3. Node 3 is connected to node 5.
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8.
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
6. Node 7 is connected to node 2.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
8. Node 9 is connected to node 8.

Based on the connections, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <2, 7, 8>
3. <5, 6, 0>
4. <5, 6, 8>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
