Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <2, 9, 4>
- <2, 9, 7>
- <4, 3, 9>
- <9, 1, 2>
- <9, 4, 7>

So, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
