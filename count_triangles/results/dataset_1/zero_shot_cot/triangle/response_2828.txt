Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 5) (8, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
2. Therefore, the triangle <0, 2, 3> is present in the graph.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
4. Therefore, the triangle <3, 5, 7> is present in the graph.

Hence, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
