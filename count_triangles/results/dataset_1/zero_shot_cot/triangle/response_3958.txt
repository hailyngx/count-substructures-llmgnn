Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

To form a triangle, we need 3 nodes connected by edges. Let's analyze each node to see if there are any triangles that can be formed:

1. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 9) - Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9. However, there are no other nodes that are connected to both nodes 5 and 9. So, no triangle involving node 0.

2. Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6) - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6. We can form a triangle <1, 2, 3>.

3. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 5) - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5. There is already a triangle <1, 2, 3> involving nodes 1 and 2.

4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 5) - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 5. There is already a triangle <1, 2, 3> involving nodes 1 and 3.

5. Node 4: (4, 5) - Node 4 is connected to node 5. However, there are no other nodes connected to both nodes 4 and 5. So, no triangle involving node 4.

6. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4) - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4. We can find the following triangles: <1, 2, 3>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 5, 3>, <4, 5, 0>.

7. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 8) - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. There are no other nodes connected to both nodes 1 and 8. So, no triangle involving node 6.

8. Node 7: (7, 8) - Node 7 is connected to node 8. However, there are no other nodes connected to both nodes 7 and 8. So, no triangle involving node 7.

9. Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 7) - Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 7. There are no other nodes connected to both nodes 6 and 7. So, no triangle involving node 8.

10. Node 9: (9, 0) - Node 9 is connected to node 0. However, there are no other nodes connected to both nodes 0 and 9. So, no triangle involving node 9.

Total number of triangles found: [4]
