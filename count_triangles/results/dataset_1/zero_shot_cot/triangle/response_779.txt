Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by checking all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Nodes 0, 6, and 8 form a triangle: <0, 6, 8>
2. Nodes 0, 7, and 8 form a triangle: <0, 7, 8>
3. Nodes 0, 7, and 3 form a triangle: <0, 7, 3>
4. Nodes 0, 8, and 3 form a triangle: <0, 8, 3>
5. Nodes 6, 0, and 8 also form a triangle: <0, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
