Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique combinations of three nodes that form triangles. Triangles occur when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles present in the given graph:

1. <1, 3, 7>
2. <2, 3, 7>
3. <3, 5, 8>
4. <3, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
