Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected by edges:
   - Node 0: [4]
   - Node 1: [5, 6, 9]
   - Node 2: [6, 8]
   - Node 4: [0]
   - Node 5: [7, 9]
   - Node 6: [2]
   - Node 7: [5]
   - Node 8: [2]
   - Node 9: [5, 1]

2. Triangles:
   - <1, 5, 9>
   - It forms a triangle since node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 9, and node 5 is also connected to node 9.

3. Total number of triangles: [1]
