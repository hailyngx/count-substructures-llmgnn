Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's list them:
1. <2, 4, 5>
2. <2, 8, 9>
3. <3, 5, 4>
4. <6, 7, 3>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
