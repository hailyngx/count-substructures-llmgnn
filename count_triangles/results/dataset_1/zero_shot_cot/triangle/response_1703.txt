Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can count the number of triangles to find all possible sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.
Let's go through the steps to count the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 7.

To find the triangles, we need to consider each set of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's list the triangles:
1. <1, 4, 9>
2. <7, 1, 9>
3. <2, 6, 9>
4. <2, 7, 6>

Count of triangles: [4]
