Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:
- Node 0 has two neighbors: 3 and 7.
- Node 1 has two neighbors: 5 and 8.
- Node 2 has one neighbor: 8.
- Node 3 has two neighbors: 0 and 7.
- Node 4 has no neighbors.
- Node 5 has one neighbor: 1.
- Node 6 has one neighbor: 8.
- Node 7 has five neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 9.
- Node 8 has five neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7.
- Node 9 has one neighbor: 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
