Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify unique sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's list down the unique triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <2, 4, 5>
5. <3, 4, 5>
6. <3, 5, 9>
7. <4, 5, 7>
8. <4, 5, 8>
9. <4, 6, 9>
10. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
