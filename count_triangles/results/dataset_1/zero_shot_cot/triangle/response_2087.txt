Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze the triangles formed by looking at each triplet of nodes connected by edges. Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. Nodes with their connected neighbors:
   - Node 0: [3]
   - Node 1: [4, 5, 9]
   - Node 2: [9]
   - Node 3: [0, 4, 5, 6, 8]
   - Node 4: [1, 3]
   - Node 5: [1, 3, 7]
   - Node 6: [3, 7, 9]
   - Node 7: [5, 6]
   - Node 8: [3, 9]
   - Node 9: [1, 2, 6, 8]

2. Triangles can be formed by checking which triplets of nodes are fully connected:
   - <1, 3, 4>
   - <1, 3, 5>
   - <1, 3, 9>
   - <3, 5, 7>
   - <3, 6, 9>
   - <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
