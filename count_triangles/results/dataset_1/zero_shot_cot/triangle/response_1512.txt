Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph and list them uniquely, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify triangles by looking for nodes that are connected in a way that forms a closed loop of length 3.
2. Calculate the total number of triangles by counting all unique triangles found in the graph.

Let's start by listing all the unique triangles:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <1, 2, 3>
4. <1, 3, 5>
5. <2, 3, 6>
6. <2, 4, 0>
7. <2, 6, 9>

Now, we count the total number of unique triangles, which is 7 in this case. Therefore, the answer is: [7].
