Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle in a graph occurs when three nodes are all pairwise connected. Let's list the triangles found:
1. <1, 4, 5>
2. <3, 5, 6>
3. <3, 7, 8>

Now, we count the total number of triangles in the graph. It looks like there are 3 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [3].
