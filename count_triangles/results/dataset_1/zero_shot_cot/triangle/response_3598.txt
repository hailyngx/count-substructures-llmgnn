Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other, forming a cycle of length 3.

Analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
1. <3, 7, 9>
2. <3, 4, 9>
3. <0, 8, 1>
4. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
