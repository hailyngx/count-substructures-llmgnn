Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all possible triangles where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the triangle.

Given the edges provided:

(0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 5), (0, 4, 5), (2, 4, 1), (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 0), (4, 1, 5), (4, 1, 0), (4, 1, 2), (5, 0, 2), (5, 0, 1), (5, 0, 8), (1, 4, 0), (1, 4, 2), (1, 4, 5), (7, 1, 4), (7, 1, 3), (7, 3, 1), (2, 0, 4), (2, 0, 5), (2, 0, 3), (2, 4, 1), (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 8)

Counting the unique triangles, we find that there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
