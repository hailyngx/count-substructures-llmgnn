Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>.
