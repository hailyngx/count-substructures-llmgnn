Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 3.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 0.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 3.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle 3: <1, 2, 6>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
