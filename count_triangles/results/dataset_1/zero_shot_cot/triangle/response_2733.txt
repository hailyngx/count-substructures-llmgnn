Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles are <0, 2, 4>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, and <4, 7, 8>.
