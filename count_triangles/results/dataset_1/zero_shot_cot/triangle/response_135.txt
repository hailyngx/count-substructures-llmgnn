Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each unique triangle formed by 3 connected nodes.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <1, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in total. Hence, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [3].
