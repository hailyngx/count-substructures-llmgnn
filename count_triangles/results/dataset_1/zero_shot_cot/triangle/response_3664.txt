Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step.

1. From the given edges, we see the following triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 5, 6)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 5, 6)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 5, 9)
   - Triangle 5: (3, 5, 9)

2. Let's check for any additional triangles:
   - By looking at the existing triangles, we can find two more triangles:
     - Triangle 6: (0, 3, 5)
     - Triangle 7: (0, 5, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <(0, 2, 4)>, <(0, 5, 6)>, <(1, 5, 6)>, <(1, 5, 9)>, <(3, 5, 9)>, <(0, 3, 5)>, and <(0, 5, 9)>.
