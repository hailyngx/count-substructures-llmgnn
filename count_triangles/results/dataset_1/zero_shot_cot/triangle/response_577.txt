Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look at all possible combinations of three nodes and check if they form a closed triangle.

Let's list all the unique triangles found using the provided edges:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 5, 6>
3. <2, 4, 5>
4. <2, 4, 6>
5. <2, 6, 9>
6. <3, 6, 9>
7. <4, 6, 7>
8. <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
