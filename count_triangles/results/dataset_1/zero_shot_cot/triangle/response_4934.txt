Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. **Check the triangles involving node 0:**
   - (0, 2, 4) form a triangle. Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
   - No other triangles involving node 0.

2. **Check the triangles involving node 1:**
   - No triangles involving node 1.

3. **Check the triangles involving node 2:**
   - (0, 2, 4) form a triangle. Triangle 2: <0, 2, 4>
   - No other triangles involving node 2.

4. **Check the triangles involving node 3:**
   - No triangles involving node 3.

5. **Check the triangles involving node 4:**
   - (0, 2, 4) form a triangle. Triangle 3: <0, 2, 4>
   - No other triangles involving node 4.

6. **Check the triangles involving node 6:**
   - (1, 6, 4) form a triangle. Triangle 4: <1, 6, 4>
   - No other triangles involving node 6.

7. **Check the triangles involving node 7:**
   - (0, 2, 7) form a triangle. Triangle 5: <0, 2, 7>
   - No other triangles involving node 7.

8. **Check the triangles involving node 8:**
   - No triangles involving node 8.

9. **Check the triangles involving node 9:**
   - (2, 6, 9) form a triangle. Triangle 6: <2, 6, 9>
   - No other triangles involving node 9.

10. **Counting the total number of triangles:**
   - Total number of triangles = 6
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
