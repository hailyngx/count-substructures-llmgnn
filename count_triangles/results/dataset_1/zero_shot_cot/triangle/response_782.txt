Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. First, let's list out all the triangles in the graph:
    - Nodes forming triangles: (0, 1, 4), (3, 4, 9)

2. Now, count the total number of triangles: [2] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
