Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <0, 8, 9>
5. <2, 1, 9>
6. <2, 5, 3>
7. <4, 7, 5>
8. <8, 4, 0>
9. <8, 4, 7>
10. <8, 4, 9>
11. <9, 1, 2>
12. <9, 6, 0>
13. <9, 6, 2>
14. <9, 6, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph: [14]
