Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected by edges. Let's go step-by-step.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <1, 5, 7>
2. <2, 3, 8>
3. <2, 4, 8>
4. <2, 4, 9>
5. <2, 8, 9>
6. <3, 8, 9>
7. <4, 6, 9>
8. <8, 4, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
