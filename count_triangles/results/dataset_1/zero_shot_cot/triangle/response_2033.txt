Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three vertices that are mutually adjacent. Let's do this step-by-step:

1. Vertices with common neighbors:
    - Vertices with common neighbors:
        - Vertices 1, 8, 9 have common neighbor 2.
        - Vertices 2, 3, 7 have common neighbor 2.
        - Vertices 2, 4, 5 have common neighbor 2.
        - Vertices 2, 7, 9 have common neighbor 3.
        - Vertices 2, 5, 8 have common neighbor 2.
        - Vertices 1, 9, 4 have common neighbor 2.
        - Vertices 2, 7, 3 have common neighbor 2.

2. Checking for actual triangles:
    - <1, 8, 9> - Triangle
    - <2, 3, 7> - Triangle
    - <2, 4, 5> - Triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
