Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to count the number of triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.

Now, let's find the triangles:

- Triangle 1: <2, 3, 4>
- Triangle 2: <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle 3: <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
