Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
8. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
