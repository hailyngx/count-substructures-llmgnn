Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 8>, <5, 7, 1>, <5, 7, 3>, <5, 8, 9>.
