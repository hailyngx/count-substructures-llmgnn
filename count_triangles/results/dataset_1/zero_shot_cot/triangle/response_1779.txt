Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each unique set of three nodes that form a triangle by sharing three edges among them. Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 5> 
2. Triangle <0, 5, 1> 
3. Triangle <3, 5, 7> 
4. Triangle <5, 7, 1> 
5. Triangle <5, 7, 3> 
6. Triangle <5, 6, 3> 
7. Triangle <5, 6, 7> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
