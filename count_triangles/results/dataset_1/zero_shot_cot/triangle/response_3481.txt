Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. We can do this by examining each set of three connected nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Based on the given edges, the triangles can be identified as follows:
1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <2, 4, 5>
4. <2, 5, 7>
5. <2, 5, 9>
6. <3, 1, 9>
7. <4, 2, 5>
8. <4, 5, 6>
9. <5, 0, 1>
10. <5, 2, 4>
11. <5, 2, 6>
12. <5, 2, 7>
13. <5, 2, 9>
14. <5, 4, 6>
15. <5, 4, 7>
16. <5, 4, 9>
17. <5, 6, 9>
18. <6, 1, 9>
19. <6, 4, 5>
20. <6, 5, 9>
21. <9, 2, 5>
22. <9, 2, 6>
23. <9, 3, 5>
24. <9, 3, 6>
25. <9, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [25].
