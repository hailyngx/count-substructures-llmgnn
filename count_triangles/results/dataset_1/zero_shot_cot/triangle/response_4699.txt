Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <2, 4, 6>
3. <4, 5, 8>
4. <4, 6, 8>
5. <5, 8, 9>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
