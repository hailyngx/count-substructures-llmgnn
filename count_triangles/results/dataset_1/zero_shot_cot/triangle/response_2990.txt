Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <1, 2, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 2, 6>
4. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
