Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first identify all the unique triangles present:

1. Triangles involving node 0:  
   - <0, 7, 1>
   - <0, 7, 2>
   - <0, 8, 4>
   - <0, 9, 2>
   
2. Triangles involving node 1:  
   - <1, 4, 2>
   - <1, 4, 5>
   - <1, 6, 7>
   
3. Triangles involving node 2:  
   - <2, 4, 5>
   - <2, 7, 0>
   
4. Triangles involving node 4:  
   - <4, 1, 6>
   - <4, 2, 5>
   - <4, 5, 3>
   - <4, 5, 8>
   
5. Triangles involving node 5:  
   - <5, 3, 4>
   
6. Triangles involving node 7:  
   - <7, 0, 8>
   - <7, 1, 2>
   
Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles:
