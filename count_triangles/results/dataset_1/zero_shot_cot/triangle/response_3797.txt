Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's list down the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle <1, 3, 8>
- Triangle <1, 3, 9>
- Triangle <1, 8, 4>
- Triangle <2, 5, 0>
- Triangle <2, 5, 1>
- Triangle <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle <3, 7, 4>
- Triangle <3, 7, 6>
- Triangle <3, 8, 6>
- Triangle <4, 7, 6>
- Triangle <8, 4, 6>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph. Since we have identified 11 unique triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
