Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's list down the triangles one by one by examining each possible combination. 

The triangles in the graph are:
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Counting all the triangles found, we get a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
