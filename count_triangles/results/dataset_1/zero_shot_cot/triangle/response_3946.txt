Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the triangles in the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5>
   - Triangle <0, 2, 6>
   - Triangle <0, 5, 6>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
   - Triangle <1, 2, 4>
   - Triangle <1, 2, 6>
   - Triangle <1, 4, 9>
   - Triangle <1, 7, 5>
   - Triangle <1, 8, 5>

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9.
   - Triangle <0, 2, 6>
   - Triangle <1, 2, 6>

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
   - Triangle <1, 4, 9>

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.
   - Triangle <0, 5, 6>
   - Triangle <5, 7, 8>

6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5.
   - Triangle <0, 2, 6>
   - Triangle <1, 2, 6>
   - Triangle <0, 5, 6>
   - Triangle <5, 7, 8>

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
   - Triangle <1, 7, 5>

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
   - Triangle <1, 8, 5>

9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
   - Triangle <1, 4, 9>

In total, there are 12 unique triangles found in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
