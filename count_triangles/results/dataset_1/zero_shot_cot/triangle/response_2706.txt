Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's look for all possible triangles formed by the given edges:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
4. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
7. Triangle <6, 8, 9>
8. Triangle <6, 9, 3>

Counting all these unique triangles, we find a total of 8 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
