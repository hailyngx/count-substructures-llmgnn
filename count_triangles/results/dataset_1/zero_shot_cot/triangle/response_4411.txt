Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. From the given graph, we can identify the possible triangles by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them to form triangles.
2. Calculating triangles manually can be error-prone, so we can follow a systematic approach using the given edges. Let's check each set of three nodes:
    - (0, 5, 8) forms a triangle.
    - (1, 6, 2) forms a triangle.
    - (1, 6, 4) forms a triangle.
    - (1, 7, 8) forms a triangle.
    - (2, 3, 6) forms a triangle.
    - (3, 9, 2) forms a triangle.
    - (5, 0, 8) forms a triangle.
    - (5, 8, 1) forms a triangle.
    - (6, 1, 2) forms a triangle.
    - (8, 5, 1) forms a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 9, 2>, <5, 0, 8>, <5, 8, 1>, <6, 1, 2>.
