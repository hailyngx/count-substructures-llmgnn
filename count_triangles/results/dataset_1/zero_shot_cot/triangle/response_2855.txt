Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>.
