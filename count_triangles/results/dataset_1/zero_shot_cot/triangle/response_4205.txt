Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the connected nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Let's list out the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 7, 9>
2. <2, 4, 6>
3. <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
