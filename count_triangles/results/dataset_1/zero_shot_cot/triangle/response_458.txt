Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each group of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

After analyzing the given graph based on the provided edges, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <1, 4, 6>
4. <2, 6, 7>
5. <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
