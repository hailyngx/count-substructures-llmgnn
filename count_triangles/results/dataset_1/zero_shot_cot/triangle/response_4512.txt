Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are mutually connected by edges. Let's list the triangles step by step:

1. List all possible triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 2)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 2, 3)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 2, 4)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 3, 9)
   - Triangle 6: (2, 5, 4)
   - Triangle 7: (2, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 8: (2, 8, 1)
   - Triangle 9: (2, 8, 9)
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
