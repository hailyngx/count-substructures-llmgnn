Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are <2, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>.
