Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. Let's go step-by-step to find these triangles:

1. For each node, identify its neighbors based on the given edges:
   - Node 0: Neighbors are 1 and 4
   - Node 1: Neighbors are 0 and 9
   - Node 2: Neighbor is 8
   - Node 3: Neighbor is 9
   - Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 5, and 6
   - Node 5: Neighbors are 4 and 7
   - Node 6: Neighbor is 4
   - Node 7: Neighbor is 5
   - Node 8: Neighbor is 2
   - Node 9: Neighbors are 1 and 3

2. Identify the triangles based on the mutual connections:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 9>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 4, 5>

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [2].
