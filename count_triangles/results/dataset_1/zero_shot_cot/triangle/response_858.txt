Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 1

Step 2: Find the triangles in the graph by looking at each triplet of nodes.
- We will check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle by having edges between each pair of nodes in the triplet.
- Count the total number of triangles and list them uniquely.

The triangles are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
