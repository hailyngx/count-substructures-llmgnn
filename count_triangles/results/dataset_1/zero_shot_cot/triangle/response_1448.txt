Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected with each other.

After reviewing the provided edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
1. <1, 4, 5>
2. <4, 6, 9>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <4, 7, 9>
5. <6, 7, 9>
6. <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
