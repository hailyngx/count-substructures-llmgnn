Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify the triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's go step-by-step to count the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 0.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 0.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 4.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.

Let's now count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle 3: <0, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
