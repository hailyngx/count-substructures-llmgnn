Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can identify triangles by finding nodes that are connected to each other in a triangular pattern.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <2, 4, 6>
6. <3, 6, 9>
7. <3, 7, 9>
8. <6, 4, 9>
9. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
