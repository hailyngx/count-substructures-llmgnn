Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, and <3, 7, 9>.
