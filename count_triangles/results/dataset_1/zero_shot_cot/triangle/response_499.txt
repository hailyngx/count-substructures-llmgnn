Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Check the triangles involving node 0:
   - (0, 2, 5)
   - (0, 3, 5)

2. Check the triangles involving node 1:
   - (1, 2, 7)
   - (1, 3, 8)

3. Check the triangles involving node 2:
   - (2, 0, 5)
   - (2, 1, 7)
   - (2, 5, 7)

4. Check the triangles involving node 3:
   - (3, 0, 5)
   - (3, 1, 8)
   - (3, 5, 6)

5. Check the triangles involving node 4:
   No triangles involving node 4.

6. Check the triangles involving node 5:
   - (5, 0, 2)
   - (5, 0, 3)
   - (5, 2, 7)
   - (5, 3, 6)
   - (5, 6, 7)

7. Check the triangles involving node 6:
   - (6, 2, 3)
   - (6, 3, 5)
   - (6, 5, 8)
   - (6, 7, 8)

8. Check the triangles involving node 7:
   - (7, 1, 2)
   - (7, 2, 5)
   - (7, 1, 8)
   - (7, 5, 8)

9. Check the triangles involving node 8:
   - (8, 1, 3)
   - (8, 6, 7)
   - (8, 3, 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [18]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 2, 3>, <6, 5, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 1, 2>, <7, 2, 5>, <7, 1, 8>.
