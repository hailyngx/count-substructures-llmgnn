Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other, forming a triangle. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 2, 7)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 4, 5)
4. Triangle 4: (1, 7, 9)
5. Triangle 5: (3, 8, 9)

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 7, 9>, and <3, 8, 9>.
