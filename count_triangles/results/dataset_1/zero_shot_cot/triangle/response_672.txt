Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine all possible combinations of three nodes and check if there are edges connecting each pair of nodes.

Let's identify the triangles by listing each unique triangle:

1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 2, 4>
4. <2, 3, 5>
5. <2, 3, 6>
6. <2, 4, 6>
7. <3, 5, 9>
8. <4, 6, 3>
9. <5, 2, 6>
10. <9, 0, 5>

There are [10] triangles in total.
