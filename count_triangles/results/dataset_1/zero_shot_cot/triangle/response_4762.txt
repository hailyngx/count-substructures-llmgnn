Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.

Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>
