Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the connected nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly or indirectly.

Let's list down the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <1, 2, 5>
4. <1, 6, 8>
5. <2, 5, 0>
6. <2, 7, 8>
7. <3, 4, 6>
8. <3, 6, 8>
9. <4, 0, 6>
10. <5, 2, 0>
11. <8, 1, 6>
12. <8, 3, 6>
13. <8, 7, 2>
14. <8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
