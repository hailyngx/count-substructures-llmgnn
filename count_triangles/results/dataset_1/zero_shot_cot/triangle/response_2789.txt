Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given graph:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 3), (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 7)

Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph.
