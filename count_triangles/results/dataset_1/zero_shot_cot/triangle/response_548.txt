Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 3>.
