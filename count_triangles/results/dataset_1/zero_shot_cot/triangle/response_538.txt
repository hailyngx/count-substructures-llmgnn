Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <2, 5, 9>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <4, 7, 9>
7. <5, 6, 9>

There are total [7] triangles in the given graph.
