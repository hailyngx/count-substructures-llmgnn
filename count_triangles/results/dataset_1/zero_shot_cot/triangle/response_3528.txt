Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the nodes connected by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected, creating a closed loop between them.

Let's find the triangles:

1. (0, 5, 8)
2. (0, 7, 8)
3. (1, 4, 3)
4. (1, 4, 8)
5. (2, 3, 9)
6. (3, 4, 5)
7. (3, 5, 8)
8. (3, 6, 8)
9. (5, 8, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
