Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected.

Let's go through the given graph and list down the unique triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <1, 8, 9>
5. <2, 5, 8>
6. <7, 8, 9>

So, there are a total of 6 unique triangles in the graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
