Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 8)
- Triangle 2: (0, 3, 9)
- Triangle 3: (0, 8, 9)
- Triangle 4: (1, 2, 7)
- Triangle 5: (3, 4, 8)
- Triangle 6: (3, 5, 7)
- Triangle 7: (4, 6, 7)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [7]
