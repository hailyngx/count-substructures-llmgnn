Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all the triangles in the given graph.

To find the triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

List of triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 3, 7>
3. <1, 4, 5>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
