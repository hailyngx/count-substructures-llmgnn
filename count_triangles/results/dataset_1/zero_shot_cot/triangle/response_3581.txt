Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will go through each possible triangle configuration:
1. Checking triangle formations involving node 0:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 2, 3)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 4, 8)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 5, 0)
   - Triangle 4: (0, 3, 1)
   
2. Checking triangle formations involving node 1:
   - Triangle 5: (1, 3, 0)
      
Since we have found all the unique triangles in the given graph, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 0>, <0, 3, 1>, and <1, 3, 0>.
