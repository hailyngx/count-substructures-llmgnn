Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in a graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. In this case, we can identify the triangles based on the given edges.

Let's list all the triangles we can find:

<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 4>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>

After listing all possible triangles, we can count that there are **9** triangles in total. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is **[9]**.
