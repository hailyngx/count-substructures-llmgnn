Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify triangles by finding nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular shape. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes directly connected by an edge:
   - (0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9) are directly connected to node 0.
   - (1, 3, 6, 8) are directly connected to node 1.
   - (2, 5) are directly connected to node 2.
   - (3, 5, 9) are directly connected to node 3.
   - (4, 5) are directly connected to node 4.
   - (5, 7, 8, 9) are directly connected to node 5.

2. Triangles:
   - <0, 1, 3> forms a triangle.
   - No other unique triangles can be formed from the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
