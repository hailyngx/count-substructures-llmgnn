Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the unique triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
