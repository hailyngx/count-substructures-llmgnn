Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the given graph by identifying the cycles of length three.

1. Triangles:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <7, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [6]
