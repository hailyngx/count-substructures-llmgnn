Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 3.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 4, 3)
- Triangle 2: (0, 4, 9)
- Triangle 3: (0, 6, 2)
- Triangle 4: (0, 6, 9)
- Triangle 5: (0, 8, 5)
- Triangle 6: (0, 8, 9)
- Triangle 7: (0, 9, 5)
- Triangle 8: (0, 9, 7)
- Triangle 9: (3, 1, 4)
- Triangle 10: (3, 4, 9)
- Triangle 11: (5, 8, 9)
- Triangle 12: (9, 7, 5)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [12]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 9, 5>, <0, 9, 7>, <3, 1, 4>, <3, 4, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <9, 7, 5>.
