Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all the triangles by checking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's list the triangles first:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Now, counting the total number of triangles in brackets []:
