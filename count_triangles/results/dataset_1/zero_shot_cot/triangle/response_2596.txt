Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [2].


The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 6>
<6, 8, 9>
