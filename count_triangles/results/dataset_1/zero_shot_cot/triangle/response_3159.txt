Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, let's follow these steps:

1. For each node, look at all pairs of its neighbors and check if there exists an edge between those pairs. If an edge exists between both pairs, then a triangle is formed.
2. Count the total number of triangles formed.

After examining the edges provided, we find the following triangles:
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
