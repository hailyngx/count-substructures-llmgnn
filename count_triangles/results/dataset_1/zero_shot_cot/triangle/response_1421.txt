Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Look for all possible triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.
2. A triangle is formed when there are three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Now, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

Triangles:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
