Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.

Now, count the total number of triangles in the graph and list them:

- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
