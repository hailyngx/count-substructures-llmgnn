Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, and <0, 8, 9>.
