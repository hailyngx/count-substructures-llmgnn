Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each unique triangle formed by three connected nodes.

Here are the unique triangles in the graph:
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
