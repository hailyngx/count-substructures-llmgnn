Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the graph:
1. (0, 3, 2)
2. (0, 3, 4)
3. (0, 6, 1)
4. (0, 7, 8)
5. (0, 9, 5)
6. (1, 4, 3)
7. (1, 6, 0)
8. (1, 8, 7)
9. (2, 3, 4)
10. (3, 4, 1)
11. (3, 8, 7)
12. (5, 9, 0)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [12]
