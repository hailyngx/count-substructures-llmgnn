Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for each unique triangle formed by three connected nodes.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
