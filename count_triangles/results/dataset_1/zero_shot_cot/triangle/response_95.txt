Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <4, 6, 5>.
