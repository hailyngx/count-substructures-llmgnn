Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, and <5, 7, 9>.
