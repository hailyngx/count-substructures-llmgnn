Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
2. Edges: (0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 7), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 2), (9, 0)

Let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <1, 5, 7>
4. <2, 3, 6>
5. <2, 5, 7>
6. <2, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
