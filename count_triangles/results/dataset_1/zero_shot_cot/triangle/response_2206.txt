Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Step 1: Identify all triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 2: <2, 3, 4>
- Triangle 3: <2, 6, 7>

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles: [3]
