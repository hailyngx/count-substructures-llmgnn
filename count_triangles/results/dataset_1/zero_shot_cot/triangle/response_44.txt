Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

- Triangle 1: (1, 4, 9)
- Triangle 2: (2, 4, 5)
- Triangle 3: (5, 7, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, and <5, 7, 9>.
