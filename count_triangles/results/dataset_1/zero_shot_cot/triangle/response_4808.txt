Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected with each other. Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 4>
<3, 2, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
