Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the edges in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [4].
