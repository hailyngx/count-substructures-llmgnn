Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible triangles formed by connecting three nodes.

Now, let's list out all the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 6, 4>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <1, 2, 5>
4. <1, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
