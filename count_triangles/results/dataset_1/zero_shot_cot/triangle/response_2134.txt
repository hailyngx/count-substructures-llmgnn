Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8)

5. Triangle <2, 1, 6>
6. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
7. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
8. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
9. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
10. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
11. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
12. Triangle <5, 7, 9>
13. Triangle <6, 3, 9>
14. Triangle <9, 6, 8>

There are a total of [14] triangles in the given graph.
