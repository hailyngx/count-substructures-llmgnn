Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's go through the nodes and edges to determine the triangles:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Triangles:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <1, 7, 8>
4. <1, 7, 9>
5. <1, 8, 4>
6. <2, 5, 6>
7. <2, 5, 9>
8. <2, 6, 9>
9. <3, 4, 7>
10. <4, 0, 3>
11. <4, 0, 9>
12. <4, 3, 7>
13. <4, 8, 1>
14. <6, 2, 9>
15. <9, 0, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
