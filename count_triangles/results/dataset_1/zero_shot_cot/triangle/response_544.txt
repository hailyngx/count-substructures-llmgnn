Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Count the total number of triangles in the graph
- For each node, check if there are two other nodes that are both connected to this node. If yes, then a triangle is formed.
- Calculate the total number of triangles by summing up the count from each node.

Step 2: Identify unique triangles
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 6>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
