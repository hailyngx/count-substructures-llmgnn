Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can go through each unique set of three nodes and check if they form a triangle based on the existing edges in the graph.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph: <0, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
