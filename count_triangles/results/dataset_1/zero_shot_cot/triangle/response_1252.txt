Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [5]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, and <2, 3, 9>.
