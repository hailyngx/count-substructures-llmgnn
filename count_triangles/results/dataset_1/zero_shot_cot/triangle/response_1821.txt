Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected.

Looking at the edges provided:
(0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6)

We can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <1, 5, 7>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <1, 4, 5>
6. <2, 1, 3>
7. <2, 1, 4>
8. <3, 1, 9>
9. <3, 6, 9>
10. <5, 6, 9>
11. <5, 1, 7>
12. <9, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [12].
