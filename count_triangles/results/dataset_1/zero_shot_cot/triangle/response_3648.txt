Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes.

Let's go step-by-step to count the triangles:

1. Check each possible combination of three nodes to see if they form a triangle by having edges between each pair of nodes:
   - Possible triangles: (0, 1, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 3, 7), (3, 4, 6), (3, 4, 8)

2. Calculate the total number of triangles formed by counting the unique triangles identified:
   - Total number of triangles: 0

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
