Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's count the number of triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 3.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle 2: <3, 5, 7>
- Triangle 3: <3, 6, 9>

There are 3 triangles in total. 

Therefore, the number of triangles is [3].
