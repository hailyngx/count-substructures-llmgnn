Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's identify all the unique triangles first:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles inside brackets []:
