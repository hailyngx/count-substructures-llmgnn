Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected to each other (i.e., form a triangle). Let's count the total number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Identify all the triangles in the graph:
- Triangles can be formed by selecting sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.
- Based on the given edges, the triangles in the graph are: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, and <1, 2, 7>.

2. Count the total number of triangles: Since we have found 3 unique triangles, the total number of triangles in brackets is [3].
