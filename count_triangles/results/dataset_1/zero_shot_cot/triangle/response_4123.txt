Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the given graph:

1. (0, 1, 5)
2. (0, 1, 9)
3. (0, 6, 4)
4. (0, 7, 2)
5. (1, 5, 2)
6. (1, 5, 9)
7. (2, 3, 5)
8. (2, 5, 8)
9. (4, 3, 5)
10. (5, 8, 2)
11. (5, 9, 1)

Count of triangles identified: 11

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
