Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's list the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
