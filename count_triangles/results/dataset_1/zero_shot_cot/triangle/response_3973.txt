Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected.

Let's list the triangles observed in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 2, 8>
4. <0, 5, 4>
5. <1, 2, 9>
6. <1, 8, 9>

Hence, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
