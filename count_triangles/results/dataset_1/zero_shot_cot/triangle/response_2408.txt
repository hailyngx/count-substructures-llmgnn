Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Write down the nodes and their connections for easier visualization:

0: 6, 9

1: 3, 4, 5, 9

2: 5

3: 1, 6, 7

4: 1

5: 1, 2, 6, 7

6: 0, 3, 5, 8

7: 3, 5

8: 6

9: 0, 1

Step 2:
Identify the triangles. Triangles are formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Triangles: 
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 6>

Step 3: 
Count the total number of triangles [3].


So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
