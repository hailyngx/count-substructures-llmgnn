Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triangles among the nodes connected by the given edges.

To form a triangle, we need to find sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected to each other. Let's start by identifying the triangles:

1. Triangle 1: Nodes (0, 2, 9) form a triangle because all three nodes are connected to each other.
2. Triangle 2: Nodes (3, 5, 7) form a triangle because all three nodes are connected to each other.
3. Triangle 3: Nodes (3, 5, 9) form a triangle because all three nodes are connected to each other.

Now that we have identified the triangles, let's count the total number of triangles in brackets []:

Total number of triangles: [3]
