Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can calculate the total number of triangles by examining each possible triangle in the graph.

Looking at the graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <2, 4, 5>
3. <4, 5, 9>
4. <6, 8, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
