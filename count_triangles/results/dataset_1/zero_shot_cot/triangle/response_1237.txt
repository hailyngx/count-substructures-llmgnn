Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are all connected with each other. Let's start by identifying the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. 

The total number of triangles is given by [7].
