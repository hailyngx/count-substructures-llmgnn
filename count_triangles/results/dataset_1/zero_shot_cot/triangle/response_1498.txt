Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with the provided edges, let's count the number of triangles.

We can find triangles by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangle-like manner. A triangle is formed when we have three nodes connected to each other.

Analyzing the given edges, we can find the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 1, 9>
4. <0, 5, 7>
5. <0, 5, 9>
6. <0, 7, 9>
7. <2, 4, 8>
8. <4, 2, 8>
9. <4, 2, 9>
10. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are total of 10 triangles in the graph as shown above. Hence, the total number of triangles is [10].
