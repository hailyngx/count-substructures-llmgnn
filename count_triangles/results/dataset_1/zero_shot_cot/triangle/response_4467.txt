Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles by examining the connections between nodes. A triangle occurs when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <1, 3, 6>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <1, 6, 8>
6. <2, 3, 6>
7. <2, 6, 7>
8. <2, 6, 8>
9. <2, 6, 9>
10. <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. Hence, the output is [10].
