Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each unique set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By examining the edges in the graph, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
