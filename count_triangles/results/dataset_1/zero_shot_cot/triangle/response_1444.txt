Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the given edges. Let's consider each potential triangle:

1. (1, 2, 3)
2. (1, 6, 9)
3. (2, 5, 6)
4. (4, 6, 9)
5. (4, 7, 8)
6. (7, 8, 9)

By examining the provided edges, we see that the following triangle exists: <1, 2, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [1].
