Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
1. Let's identify the triangles in this graph step by step:
    a. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
    b. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9.
    c. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9.
    d. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8.
    e. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
    f. Node 5 is connected to node 7.
    g. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
    h. Node 7 is connected to node 5.
    i. Node 8 is connected to node 3.
    j. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.

2. Now, let's find the triangles:
    a. <0, 1, 9>
    b. <0, 2, 9>
    c. <1, 2, 6>
