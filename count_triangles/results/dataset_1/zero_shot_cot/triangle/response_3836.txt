Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

From the given edges, we can see the following triangles:
1. <1, 2, 6>
2. <4, 5, 9>
3. <8, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
