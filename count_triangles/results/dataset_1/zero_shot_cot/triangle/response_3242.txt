Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph. A triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given graph, we can find the following triangles:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.

Hence, the total number of triangles is [8]. The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 0, 9>
<6, 1, 9>
