Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges in the graph.

Given the edges:
(0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8)
(1, 8)
(2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8)
(3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5)
(4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7)
(5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6)
(6, 0) (6, 5)
(7, 0) (7, 4)
(8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9)
(9, 8)

Let's find the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
