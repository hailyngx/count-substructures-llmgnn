Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <1, 2, 5>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <4, 6, 8>
7. <6, 8, 9>

There are a total of 7 triangles in the graph, so the output is [7].
