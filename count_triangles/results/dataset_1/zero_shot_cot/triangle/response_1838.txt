Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 7>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles which is [5].
