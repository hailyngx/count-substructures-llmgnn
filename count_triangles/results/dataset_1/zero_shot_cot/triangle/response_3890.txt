Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the triangles in the graph:

1. (0, 3, 2)
2. (0, 3, 5)
3. (0, 3, 8)
4. (0, 5, 8)
5. (1, 4, 7)
6. (5, 6, 1)
7. (5, 6, 9)
8. (5, 7, 4)
9. (5, 7, 8)

Counting the number of unique triangles, we have 9 triangles in total.

So, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
