Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {7, 8, 9}
2. Nodes connected to node 1: {2, 6, 7, 9}
3. Nodes connected to node 2: {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
4. Nodes connected to node 3: {6}
5. Nodes connected to node 4: {2, 5}
6. Nodes connected to node 5: {2, 4, 9}
7. Nodes connected to node 6: {1, 3, 7, 9}
8. Nodes connected to node 7: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
9. Nodes connected to node 8: {0, 2}
10. Nodes connected to node 9: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. Triangles involving node 0: <0, 7, 9>
2. Triangles involving node 1: <1, 2, 7>, <1, 6, 9>
3. Triangles involving node 2: 
   - <1, 2, 7>
   - <1, 2, 8>
   - <2, 5, 9>
4. Triangles involving node 3: None
5. Triangles involving node 4: None
6. Triangles involving node 5: None
7. Triangles involving node 6: <1, 6, 9>
8. Triangles involving node 7: <0, 7, 9>
9. Triangles involving node 8: None
10. Triangles involving node 9: None

Now, summing up all the unique triangles, we find a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
