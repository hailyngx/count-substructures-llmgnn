Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that form a triangle - meaning each node is connected to the other two nodes in the set.

Going through the provided edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <2, 3, 9>
3. <3, 7, 8>
4. <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
