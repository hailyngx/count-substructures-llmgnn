Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected in a closed loop.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [9].
