Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7

Step 2: Count the triangles by examining the possible triangles involving each node:
- For node 0: (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 9)
- For node 3: (3, 0, 9), (3, 0, 4), (3, 5, 9), (3, 9, 7)

Step 3: Calculate the total number of triangles:
- Total number of triangles = 2 (unique triangles found)
