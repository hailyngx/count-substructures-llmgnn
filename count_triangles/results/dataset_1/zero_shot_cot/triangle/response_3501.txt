Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges.
To find the number of triangles and list the unique triangles, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's start by listing the triangles found in this graph:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <3, 4, 7>
5. <3, 7, 8>
6. <4, 5, 7>
7. <4, 6, 7>
8. <5, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [8]
