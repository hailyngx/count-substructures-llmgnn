Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can determine the number of triangles it contains. 

A triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other. To count the number of triangles, we can look for each node and see if there are connected nodes that can form a triangle with the initial node.

Let's list the unique triangles found:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<5, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
