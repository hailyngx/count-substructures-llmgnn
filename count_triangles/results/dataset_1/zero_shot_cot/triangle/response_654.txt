Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 3, 8>
4. <2, 3, 4>
5. <2, 4, 9>
6. <3, 4, 9>
7. <5, 6, 8>
8. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
