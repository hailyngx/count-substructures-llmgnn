Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
