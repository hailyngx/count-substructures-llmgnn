Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every combination of three nodes and check if there is an edge between each pair of nodes in the combination. Let's do this step-by-step:

1. Check all possible triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 6)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 1, 9)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 6, 9)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 2, 6)
   - Triangle 5: (1, 2, 9)
   - Triangle 6: (2, 5, 9)
   - Triangle 7: (3, 5, 7)
   - Triangle 8: (5, 6, 9)

2. Count the total number of triangles found: [8]

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. Let's list the unique triangles below:
<0, 1, 6> <0, 1, 9> <0, 6, 9> <1, 2, 6> <1, 2, 9> <2, 5, 9> <3, 5, 7> <5, 6, 9>
