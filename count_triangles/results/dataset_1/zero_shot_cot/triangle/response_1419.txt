Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible triangles formed by the edges given. 

Let's calculate the total number of triangles step by step:

Step 1: Go through each node and see if there is a triangle formed.
- For node 0: (0, 7) and (7, 0) are connected. No triangles with node 0.
- For node 1: (1, 6), (1, 9), and (6, 9) form a triangle <1, 6, 9>.
- For node 2: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 5), (5, 6), and (6, 3) form multiple triangles.
- For node 3: (3, 2) and (3, 5) form a triangle.
- For node 4: (4, 7), (4, 9), and (7, 9) form a triangle <4, 7, 9>.
- For node 5: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), and (6, 2) form multiple triangles.
- For node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), and (6, 8) form multiple triangles.
- For node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 4), and (0, 4) form multiple triangles.
- For node 8: (8, 3) and (8, 6) form a triangle.
- For node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), and (1, 2) form a triangle.

Step 2: List the unique triangles found:
- <1, 6, 9>
- <4, 7, 9>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles: [2]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
