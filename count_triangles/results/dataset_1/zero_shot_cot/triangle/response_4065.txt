Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By examining the provided edges, we can identify the following triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle <1, 7, 8>
- Triangle <1, 9, 5>
- Triangle <1, 9, 7>
- Triangle <2, 0, 7>
- Triangle <2, 1, 9>
- Triangle <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle <3, 7, 9>
- Triangle <5, 8, 1>
- Triangle <5, 9, 1>
- Triangle <7, 8, 1>
- Triangle <8, 7, 1>
- Triangle <9, 1, 5>
- Triangle <9, 1, 7>
- Triangle <9, 2, 1>
- Triangle <9, 3, 4>
- Triangle <9, 3, 7>
- Triangle <9, 4, 3>
- Triangle <9, 5, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
