Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node

Node 0: 5
Node 1: 1
Node 2: 5
Node 3: 3
Node 4: 6
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 5
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 1

Step 2: Count the number of triangles

Let's analyze node by node:

Node 0: (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 6), (0, 5, 6), (0, 4, 7), (0, 5, 7), (0, 6, 7), (4, 5, 6), (4, 5, 7), (4, 6, 7), (5, 6, 7) - 10 triangles
Node 1: No triangles
Node 2: (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6), (2, 5, 6), (2, 4, 7), (2, 5, 7), (2, 6, 7), (4, 5, 6), (4, 5, 7), (4, 6, 7), (5, 6, 7) - 10 triangles
Node 3: (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 7), (3, 4, 7) - 3 triangles
Node 4: (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 6), (0, 4, 7), (0, 5, 6), (0, 5, 7), (0, 6, 7), (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6), (2, 4, 7), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 7), (2, 6, 7) - 12 triangles
Node 5: (0, 4, 5), (0, 5, 6), (0, 5, 7), (4, 5, 6), (4, 5, 7), (5, 6, 7) - 6 triangles
Node 6: (0, 4, 6), (0, 6, 7), (4, 6, 7) - 3 triangles
Node 7: (0, 4, 7), (0, 6, 7), (2, 4, 7), (2, 6, 7), (3, 4, 7) - 5 triangles
Node 8: No triangles
Node 9: No triangles

Total number of triangles = 10 + 0 + 10 + 3 + 12 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 0 + 0 = 49
