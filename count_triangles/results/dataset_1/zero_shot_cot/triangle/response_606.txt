Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
6. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
7. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
8. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
9. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
10. Triangle <4, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
