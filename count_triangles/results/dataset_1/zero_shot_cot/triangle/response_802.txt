Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].  

The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, and <5, 8, 9>.
