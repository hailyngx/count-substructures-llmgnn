Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. Let's start by identifying the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 3, 8
2. Triangle 2: Nodes 1, 2, 6
3. Triangle 3: Nodes 1, 2, 7
4. Triangle 4: Nodes 1, 5, 9
5. Triangle 5: Nodes 2, 3, 7
6. Triangle 6: Nodes 3, 5, 9

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [6]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
