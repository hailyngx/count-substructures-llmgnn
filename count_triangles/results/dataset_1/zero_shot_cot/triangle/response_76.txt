Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles in this graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle 2: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 3: <4, 8, 9>

There are a total of [3] triangles in this graph.
