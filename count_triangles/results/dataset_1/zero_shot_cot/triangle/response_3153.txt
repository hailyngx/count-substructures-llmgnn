Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. 

By observing the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:

1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <1, 2, 4>
4. <2, 4, 6>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
