Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's look for all triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. 

Let's start by listing all the triangles found in the graph:
- <0, 4, 2>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 5, 3>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 8, 9>
- <4, 7, 6>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <5, 3, 6>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 4>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <6, 9, 8>
- <8, 4, 7>
- <8, 4, 2>
- <8, 2, 9>
- <9, 2, 4>
- <9, 2, 8>
- <9, 6, 7>

Counting the unique triangles, we find a total of [19] triangles in this graph.
