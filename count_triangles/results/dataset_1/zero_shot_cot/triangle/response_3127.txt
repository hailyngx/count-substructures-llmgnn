Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Check if any node has at least two edges connecting to other nodes:
    - Node 0 has edges (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8).
    - Node 1 has edges (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9).
    - Node 2 has edges (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 8).
    - Node 3 has edges (3, 6), (3, 7).
    - Node 4 has edges (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 8).
    - Node 5 has edges (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 9).
    - Node 6 has edges (6, 3), (6, 5).
    - Node 7 has edges (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 9).
    - Node 8 has edges (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 7).
    - Node 9 has edges (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 7).

2. Review potential triangles involving nodes with at least two edges:
    - Triangle involving node 0: (0, 4), (0, 5), (4, 5). Triangle <0, 4, 5>.
    - Triangle involving node 1: (1, 4), (1, 5), (4, 5). Triangle <1, 4, 5>.
    - Triangle involving node 2: (1, 2), (2, 4), (1, 4). Triangle <1, 2, 4>.
    - Triangle involving node 4: (0, 4), (4, 2), (0, 2). Triangle <0, 2, 4>.
    - Triangle involving node 5: (5, 0), (0, 4), (4, 5). Triangle <0, 4, 5>.
    - Triangle involving node 7: (3, 7), (7, 8), (3, 8). Triangle <3, 7, 8>.
    - Triangle involving node 8: (2, 8), (4, 8), (2, 4). Triangle <2, 4, 8>.
    - Triangle involving node 9: (1, 9), (5, 9), (1, 5). Triangle <1, 5, 9>.

3. Count the total number of unique triangles: [5].
