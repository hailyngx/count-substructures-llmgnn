Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's start by listing all the triangles:

1. <0, 6, 7>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <7, 2, 8>
6. <0, 7, 1>
7. <0, 7, 2>
8. <0, 7, 9>
9. <6, 7, 1>
10. <6, 7, 2>
11. <6, 7, 9>
12. <7, 8, 2>
13. <7, 9, 0>
14. <7, 9, 1>

There are a total of 14 triangles in this graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [14].
