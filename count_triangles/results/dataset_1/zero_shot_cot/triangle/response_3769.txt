Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by finding the number of connected triples of vertices. A triangle is formed when three vertices are connected to each other. Let's count the total number of triangles in the given graph.

We can see that for a triangle to exist, there must be edges between each pair of the three vertices. We will list the triangles by examining each set of three connected vertices in the graph.

Triangular relationships:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <4, 6, 9>
3. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
