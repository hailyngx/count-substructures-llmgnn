Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected by edges. We'll consider each possible set of three nodes and check if there are edges connecting all three nodes.

Let's list the unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
