Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Here are the steps to determine the total number of triangles:

1. Identify all triangles present in the graph:
   - <0, 2, 3>
   - <0, 3, 5>
   - <0, 5, 6>
   - <1, 3, 5>
   - <1, 5, 6>
   - <3, 4, 9>
   - <5, 6, 8>
   - <8, 9, 4>

2. Count the total number of triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 8

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
