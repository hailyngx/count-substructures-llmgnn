Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
2. Node 2 is connected to node 3.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8.
7. Node 7 is connected to node 3.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
9. Node 9 is connected to node 5.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <3, 4, 6>
3. <3, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
