Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible triangles among the nodes based on the edges provided.
Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
8. Triangle <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
