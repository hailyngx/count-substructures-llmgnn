Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze each set of three nodes that are connected to each other. 

The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are total [10] triangles in this graph.
