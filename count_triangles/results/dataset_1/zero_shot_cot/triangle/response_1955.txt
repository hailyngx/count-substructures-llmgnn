Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other with edges.

Let's list out the unique triangles found:
1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <1, 5, 4>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <1, 8, 2>
6. <1, 9, 0>
7. <2, 4, 7>

Total number of triangles: [7]
