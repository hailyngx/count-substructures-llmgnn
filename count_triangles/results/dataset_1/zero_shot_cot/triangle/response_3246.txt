Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. 
Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify Triangles:**
   - Triangles are formed by 3 nodes connected by edges.
   - We will look for sets of 3 nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

2. **Nodes Connected in Triangles:**
   - From the given edges, we can identify potential triangles:
     - Triangles involving node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 5, 6), (1, 7, 9)
     - Triangles involving node 2: (2, 4, 7), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 7), (2, 6, 8)
     - Triangles involving node 4: (1, 2, 4), (4, 5, 8)
     - Triangles involving node 5: (1, 5, 9), (2, 5, 7), (4, 5, 8), (5, 6, 7)
     - Triangles involving node 6: (1, 5, 6), (2, 5, 6), (4, 6, 8), (5, 6, 7)
     - Triangles involving node 7: (1, 7, 9), (2, 4, 7), (2, 5, 7), (5, 6, 7)
     - Triangles involving node 8: (2, 6, 8), (4, 5, 8), (4, 6, 8)
     - Triangles involving node 9: (1, 5, 9), (1, 7, 9)

3. **Counting Unique Triangles:**
   - From the above list, we can see that the triangles are <1, 2, 4>, <1, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, and <4, 6, 8>.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
