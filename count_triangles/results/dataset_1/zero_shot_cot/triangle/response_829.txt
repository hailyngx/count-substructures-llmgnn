Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's start by counting the number of triangles in the given graph.

Now, let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
