Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:
```
0: [4, 5]
1: [7]
2: [3, 7, 8]
3: [2, 5]
4: [0]
5: [0, 3]
6: [9]
7: [1, 2]
8: [2]
9: [6]
```
Now, let's find the number of triangles in the graph. A triangle exists when three nodes are connected to each other forming a closed loop.

Let's list the unique triangles:
1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <2, 3, 7>
3. <2, 7, 8>

Count of triangles: [3]
