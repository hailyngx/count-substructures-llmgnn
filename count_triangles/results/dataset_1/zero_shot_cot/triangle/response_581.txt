Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <2, 1, 5>
4. <2, 3, 7>
5. <3, 4, 5>
6. <3, 5, 7>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
