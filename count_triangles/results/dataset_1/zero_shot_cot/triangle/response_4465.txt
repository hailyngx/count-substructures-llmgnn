Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Identify all the possible triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other forming a closed loop.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
