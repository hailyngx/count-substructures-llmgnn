Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's first find all possible triangles by examining the connections between nodes:

1. Triangles involving node 1:
   - No triangles involving node 1.

2. Triangles involving node 2:
   - No triangles involving node 2.

3. Triangles involving node 3:
   - Triangle <2, 3, 7>.

4. Triangles involving node 4:
   - No triangles involving node 4.

5. Triangles involving node 5:
   - No triangles involving node 5.

6. Triangles involving node 6:
   - No triangles involving node 6.

7. Triangles involving node 7:
   - Triangle <3, 7, 9>.

8. Triangles involving node 8:
   - No triangles involving node 8.

9. Triangles involving node 9:
   - No triangles involving node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 7> and <3, 7, 9>.
