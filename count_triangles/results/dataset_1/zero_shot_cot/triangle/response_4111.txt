Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can use the concept that a triangle is formed when three vertices are connected pairwise by edges. We will look for all possible triangles by checking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles found in the given graph are:
1. <1, 4, 7>
2. <1, 7, 8>
3. <1, 7, 9>
4. <1, 8, 9>
5. <2, 5, 8>
6. <2, 5, 3>
7. <5, 3, 8>

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in total in the given graph.
