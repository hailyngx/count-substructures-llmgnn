Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by connecting the nodes.

Given edges:
(0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8)
(1, 4) (1, 8)
(2, 0) (2, 3)
(3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5)
(4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8)
(5, 3) (5, 4)
(6, 4)
(7, 8)
(8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9)
(9, 8)

Let's list out the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in total in the given graph.
