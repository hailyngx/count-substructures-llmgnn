Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 9>.
