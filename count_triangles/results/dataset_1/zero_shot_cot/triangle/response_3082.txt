Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step by step to identify the triangles:

1. Nodes directly connected:
   - Nodes 0, 2, and 9 are connected, forming a triangle <0, 2, 9>.
   
2. Nodes indirectly connected through a common neighbor:
   - Nodes 0 and 9 are connected through node 2. So, there's another triangle <0, 2, 9>.
   
3. Nodes directly connected:
   - Nodes 1, 6, and 9 are connected, forming a triangle <1, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
