Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected. In other words, we need to find all the triangles in the graph.

Let's first list the triangles we can form in this graph:
1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <2, 6, 7>
3. <2, 6, 8>

These are the unique triangles we can find in the graph. So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
