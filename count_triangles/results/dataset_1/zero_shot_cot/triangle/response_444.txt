Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other in groups of three.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <1, 5, 9>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <5, 6, 7>
5. <8, 9, 5>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles identified.

Total number of triangles: [5]
