Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the given graph:

1. Look for triangles that consist of nodes connected by edges:

- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 3: <4, 5, 9>
- Triangle 4: <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle 5: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 6: <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle 7: <5, 8, 9>
- Triangle 8: <6, 8, 9>

2. Now count the number of unique triangles found: [8]
