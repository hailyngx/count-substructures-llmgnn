Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can go through each unique triplet of nodes and check if there is an edge between each pair of nodes in the triplet. If there is an edge between each pair of nodes in the triplet, then we have found a triangle.

From the given information, the nodes in the graph are {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's find the triangles:

1. Triangles with node 0:
   - <0, 3, 8>
   
2. Triangles with node 2:
   - <2, 5, 6>
   - <2, 6, 9>
   - <2, 5, 9>
   - <2, 6, 7>
   
3. Triangles with node 3:
   - <3, 0, 8>
   
4. Triangles with node 5: None

5. Triangles with node 6: None

6. Triangles with node 7:
   - <7, 6, 8>
   
7. Triangles with node 8: None

8. Triangles with node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <7, 6, 8>.
