Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are: <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 5, 8>.
