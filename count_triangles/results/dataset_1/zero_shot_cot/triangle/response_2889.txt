Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. For each node, check if there are any pairs of neighbors that are connected. These pairs combined with the original node will form a triangle.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.
3. Output the total number of triangles inside brackets [ ].

Based on the given graph, the triangles found are: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 8, 9>. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
