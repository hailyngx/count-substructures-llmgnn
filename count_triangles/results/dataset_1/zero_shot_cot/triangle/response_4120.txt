Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's start by listing the triangles:

1. <1, 2, 6>
2. <3, 7, 4>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <4, 8, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
