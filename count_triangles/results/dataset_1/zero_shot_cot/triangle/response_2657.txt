Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangle formation.

The triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<4, 5, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
