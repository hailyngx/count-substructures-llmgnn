Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 6, 3>
3. <0, 8, 4>
4. <3, 9, 4>
5. <0, 6, 8>

Counting the number of triangles: [5]
