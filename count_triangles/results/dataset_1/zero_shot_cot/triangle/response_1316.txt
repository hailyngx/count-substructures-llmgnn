Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the triangles in the given graph:

- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 5)
- Triangle 2: (4, 7, 8)
- Triangle 3: (4, 8, 9)
- Triangle 4: (5, 3, 9)

There are 4 triangles in total.  
Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [4].
