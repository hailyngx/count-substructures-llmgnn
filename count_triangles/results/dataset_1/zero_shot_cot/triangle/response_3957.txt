Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's start by listing all the triangles present in the graph: 
- <2, 0, 3>
- <2, 5, 1>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 9, 7>
- <4, 6, 1>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <7, 9, 2>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph:
[8] 

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
