Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 1.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <1, 2, 8>
- Triangle 2: <2, 3, 8>
- Triangle 3: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 4: <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle 5: <3, 4, 8>

Counting the total number of unique triangles in the given graph, we found 5 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
