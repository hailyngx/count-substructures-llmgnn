Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each set of three nodes and check if they form a triangle connected by edges.

Here is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<7, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
