Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's first list all the triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 6, 8>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <2, 3, 6>
5. <4, 7, 8>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
