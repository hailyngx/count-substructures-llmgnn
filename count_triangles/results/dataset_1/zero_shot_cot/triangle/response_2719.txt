Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, let's count the number of triangles present in the graph step by step.

1. Nodes 0, 1, and 3 form a triangle: <0, 1, 3>
2. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle: <1, 2, 3>
3. Nodes 1, 3, and 6 do not form a triangle since there is no edge between nodes 1 and 6.
4. Nodes 2, 3, and 9 form a triangle: <2, 3, 9>
5. Nodes 3, 5, and 9 form a triangle: <3, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
