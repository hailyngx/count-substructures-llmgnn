Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles present in the graph given the edge list:
1. <4, 8, 9>
2. <5, 8, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
