Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.
