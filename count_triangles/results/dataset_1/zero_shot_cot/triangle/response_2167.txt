Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's list out all the triangles with unique nodes:
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 0, 2>
<5, 1, 2>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 3, 8>

There are 8 unique triangles in total, so the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
