Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. Let's go step-by-step:

Possible triangles involving node 0:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 7, 0>

Possible triangles involving node 1:
- No triangles involving node 1.

Possible triangles involving node 2:
- No triangles involving node 2.

Possible triangles involving node 3:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 8, 9>

Possible triangles involving node 4:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <3, 4, 5>

Possible triangles involving node 5:
- No triangles involving node 5.

Possible triangles involving node 6:
- No triangles involving node 6.

Possible triangles involving node 7:
- No triangles involving node 7.

Possible triangles involving node 8:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <3, 8, 9>

Possible triangles involving node 9:
- <3, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [3]

Unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <3, 4, 5>
