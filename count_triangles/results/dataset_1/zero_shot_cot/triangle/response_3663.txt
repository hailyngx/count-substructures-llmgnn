Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for triangles formed by three connected nodes.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<6, 9, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
