Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can find the total number of triangles in the graph by looking for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. These sets of nodes represent triangles in the graph.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph step-by-step:
1. Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 5, 6)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 3, 6)
4. Triangle 4: (1, 6, 9)
5. Triangle 5: (2, 0, 5)
6. Triangle 6: (4, 2, 0)
7. Triangle 7: (4, 7, 8)

So, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles identified are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 0, 5>, <4, 2, 0>, and <4, 7, 8>.
