Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all interconnected with each other.

Looking at the graph provided, we will list the unique triangles:

1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <1, 2, 8>
4. <4, 6, 8>

Hence, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
