Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the three connected nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 9),
(1, 7),
(2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9),
(3, 5), (3, 9),
(4, 9),
(5, 8),
(7, 8),
(9, 4)

Now, we will identify the triangles formed by these edges:
1. Triangle 1: <0, 2, 7>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 2, 9>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 3, 5>
4. Triangle 4: <0, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
