Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 0
- Node 10: degree 0

Step 2: Find triangles in the graph:
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 4, 9> 

Step 3: Calculate the total number of triangles: [2]
