Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, let's first identify all triangles by looking for cycles of length 3.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 2>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <1, 2, 8>
5. <1, 2, 9>
6. <2, 3, 8>
7. <2, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
