Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, there are [5] total triangles.

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
