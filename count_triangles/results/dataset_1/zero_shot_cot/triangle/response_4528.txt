Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 3, 4)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 4, 7)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 5, 3)
4. Triangle 4: (1, 6, 7)

There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles = [4].
