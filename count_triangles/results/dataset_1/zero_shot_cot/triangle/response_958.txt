Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 4, 9>, and <9, 7, 6>. So, the total number of triangles is [10].
