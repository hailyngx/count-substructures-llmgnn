Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all the triangles in the graph:
   - <0, 4, 7>
   - <0, 4, 9>
   - <0, 7, 9>
   - <2, 4, 8>
   - <3, 4, 5>
   - <5, 7, 9>
   - <6, 4, 8>
   - <8, 5, 9>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles: [8]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
