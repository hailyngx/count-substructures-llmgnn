Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify triangles by finding nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle shape.
    
    Let's identify the triangles using the given edges:
    
    - Triangle 1: (0, 7, 8)
    - Triangle 2: (0, 7, 9)
    - Triangle 3: (0, 8, 9)
    - Triangle 4: (1, 2, 8)
    - Triangle 5: (1, 3, 9)

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles found.

    Total Number of Triangles: [5]

Step 3: List the unique triangles found.

    <0, 7, 8>
    <0, 7, 9>
    <0, 8, 9>
    <1, 2, 8>
    <1, 3, 9>
