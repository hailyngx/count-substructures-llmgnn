Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will examine all possible triangles formed by the nodes connected by the edges. 

Let's list all unique triangles in the graph:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 2, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 0, 7>
<5, 0, 8>
<8, 5, 9>

Now, calculating the total number of triangles: [11]
