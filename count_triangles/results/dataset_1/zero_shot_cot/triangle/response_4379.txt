Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
I will count the number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 3.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 0.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.

Now, let's determine the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <3, 4, 5>
- Triangle <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
