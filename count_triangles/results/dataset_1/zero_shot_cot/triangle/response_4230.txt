Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 2>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 2>
