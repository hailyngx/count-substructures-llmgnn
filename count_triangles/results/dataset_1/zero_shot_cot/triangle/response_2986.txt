Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes each node is connected to:

Node 0: 3, 9  
Node 1: 2, 4, 8  
Node 2: 1, 4, 8  
Node 3: 0, 7  
Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 9  
Node 5: 7  
Node 6: 7  
Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6  
Node 8: 1, 2, 9  
Node 9: 0, 4, 8  

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
