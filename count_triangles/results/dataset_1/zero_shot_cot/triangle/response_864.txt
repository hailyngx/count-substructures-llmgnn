Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Identify all the triangles by looking for nodes that are all connected to each other.
2. List the unique triangles.

After analyzing the given graph, the total number of triangles is [4] as listed below:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
