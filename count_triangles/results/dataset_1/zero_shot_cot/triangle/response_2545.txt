Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's first list all the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <1, 5, 8>
4. <5, 6, 8>
5. <5, 6, 7>
6. <5, 7, 9>

Count of triangles: [6]
