Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles in the graph by looking for cycles of length 3.
2. List all unique triangles found.
3. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's start by listing the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 1, 9>
4. <0, 2, 4>
5. <0, 2, 9>
6. <0, 4, 9>
7. <1, 2, 4>
8. <1, 4, 9>
9. <2, 3, 5>
10. <4, 9, 6>
11. <7, 5, 8>
12. <9, 6, 1>
13. <9, 8, 7>

Counting the total number of unique triangles, we find that there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
