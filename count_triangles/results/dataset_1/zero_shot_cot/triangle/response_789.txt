Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can describe each triangle as a unique combination of three nodes.

Let's identify the triangles using the given edges:
1. Triangle: <0, 6, 7>
2. Triangle: <3, 6, 8>
3. Triangle: <4, 5, 6>
4. Triangle: <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
