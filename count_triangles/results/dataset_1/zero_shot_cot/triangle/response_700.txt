Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Considering the given graph, we can determine the number of triangles by looking for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 5, 1>
3. <4, 3, 6>
4. <4, 6, 9>
5. <5, 9, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
