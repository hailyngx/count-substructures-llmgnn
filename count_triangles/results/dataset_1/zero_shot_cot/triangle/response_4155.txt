Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that form a triangle by having edges between each pair of nodes.

Let's list the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 1, 7>
4. <0, 1, 9>
5. <0, 5, 7>
6. <0, 6, 7>
7. <0, 9, 5>
8. <1, 3, 5>
9. <1, 3, 8>
10. <1, 5, 7>
11. <2, 5, 7>
12. <2, 5, 9>
13. <3, 5, 7>
14. <3, 5, 9>
15. <5, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [15]
