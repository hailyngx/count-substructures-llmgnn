Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's solve this step-by-step to count the number of triangles:

1. **Identify the triangles**: To find triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

2. **Count the triangles**:
    - Triangle 1: (3, 5, 6)
    - Triangle 2: (5, 6, 9)

3. **Output**:
    - Total number of triangles: [2]
    - Triangles found: <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>
