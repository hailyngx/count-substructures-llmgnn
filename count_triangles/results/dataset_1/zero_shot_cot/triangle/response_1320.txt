Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by sets of three interconnected nodes. Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes 0, 4, and 3 form a triangle: <0, 4, 3>
2. Nodes 1, 3, and 4 form a triangle: <1, 3, 4>
3. Nodes 1, 5, and 8 form a triangle: <1, 5, 8>
4. Nodes 2, 1, and 3 form a triangle: <2, 1, 3>
5. Nodes 2, 1, and 5 form a triangle: <2, 1, 5>
6. Nodes 2, 1, and 8 form a triangle: <2, 1, 8>
7. Nodes 2, 1, and 9 form a triangle: <2, 1, 9>
8. Nodes 2, 3, and 9 form a triangle: <2, 3, 9>
9. Nodes 3, 4, and 0 form a triangle: <3, 4, 0>
10. Nodes 3, 4, and 9 form a triangle: <3, 4, 9>
11. Nodes 5, 1, and 8 form a triangle: <5, 1, 8>
12. Nodes 5, 1, and 8 form a triangle: <5, 1, 8>
13. Nodes 5, 6, and 9 form a triangle: <5, 6, 9>
14. Nodes 6, 9, and 8 form a triangle: <6, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
