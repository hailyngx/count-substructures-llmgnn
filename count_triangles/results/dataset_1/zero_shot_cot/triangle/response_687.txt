Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every set of three nodes that are all mutually connected. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Check all possible triangles:
   - <0, 5, 4>
   - <0, 5, 4>
   - <0, 6, 0>
   - <0, 8, 4>
   - <0, 8, 9>
   - <0, 9, 4>
   - <4, 9, 8>

2. Total number of triangles found: [7]

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
