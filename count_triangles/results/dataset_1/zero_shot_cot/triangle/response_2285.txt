Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's look for all possible triangles formed by three connected nodes.

The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to node 2.
- Node 8 is connected to node 2.

Now, let's identify the triangles in this graph:
1. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
