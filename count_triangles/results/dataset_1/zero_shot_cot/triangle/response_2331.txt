Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 7>
   
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 4>
   - Triangle <1, 4, 7>
   
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
   
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
   
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7.
   - Triangle <1, 4, 7>
   - Triangle <3, 4, 5>
   
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
   
7. Node 6 is connected to node 7.
   
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 7>
   - Triangle <0, 4, 7>
   - Triangle <1, 4, 7>
   - Triangle <4, 5, 7>
   
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
   
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.

Total number of triangles: [6]
