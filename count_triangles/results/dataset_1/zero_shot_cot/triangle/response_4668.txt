Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

We can find triangles by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a way that forms a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 8>

So, there are a total of [8] triangles in the graph.
