Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph <10 nodes, 34 edges> is [8]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 0>, <5, 4, 8>, <6, 8, 4>, <8, 9, 1>.
