Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9. There is a triangle formed by nodes 1, 2, and 9: <1, 2, 9>.
2. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. There are triangles formed by nodes (2, 6, 9), (2, 6, 8), and (4, 6, 9): <2, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>.
3. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6. We already identified the triangles with node 2 and 6, so we don't need to consider this node further.

Adding up the identified unique triangles, we have found 3 triangles in total: <1, 2, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 8>. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
