Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's follow these steps:

1. First, identify all the triangles formed by 3 connected nodes.
2. List these triangles without repeating any.

Let's start by listing the triangles we can find:

<1, 5, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 7, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 9, 8>
<5, 9, 2>
<5, 1, 6>
<6, 3, 9>

Now, counting the total number of triangles: [12]
