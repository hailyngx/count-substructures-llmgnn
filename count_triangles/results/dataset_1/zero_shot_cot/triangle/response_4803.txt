Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all the possible triangles that can be formed using the given edges. 

Here is a step-by-step process:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 5 is connected to nodes 2 and node 4. Therefore, there is a triangle <1, 2, 4>.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 5 is connected to nodes 4. Therefore, there is a triangle <2, 4, 5>.
3. Node 3 is connected to node 8 and 8 is connected to node 5. However, node 5 is not connected to node 3. So, no triangle can be formed with node 3.
4. Node 4 is connected to node 5 and node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 2. Therefore, there is a triangle <1, 4, 5>.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8. Therefore, there are two triangles <1, 2, 5> and <1, 4, 5>.
6. Node 6 is connected to node 9, but no triangle can be formed with these connections.
7. Node 7 is connected to node 9, but no triangle can be formed with these connections.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 5. 5 is also connected to 1, 2, and 4. Therefore, there is a triangle <1, 3, 5>.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 7, but no triangle can be formed with these connections.

Summarizing the triangles found: [<1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 5>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [5].
