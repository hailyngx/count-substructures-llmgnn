Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify unique triangles formed by the nodes using the provided edge information.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<5, 4, 6>
<2, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
