Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its connections:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.

Now, we will identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 8, 3>
6. Triangle <3, 8, 7>

Thus, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
