Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list down all the triangles that can be formed in this graph:

1. Nodes (0, 2, 3)
2. Nodes (0, 3, 4)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [2].
