Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph can be found by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in this graph:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 6, 3>
<0, 8, 3>
<1, 2, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<8, 9, 1>
<8, 9, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
