Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we can identify the triangles in the graph by looking at sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <2, 4, 8>
3. <0, 2, 7>
4. <8, 9, 0>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph. 

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
