Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by three nodes.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <2, 4, 6>
3. <2, 7, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
