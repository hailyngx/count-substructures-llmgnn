Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's start by listing the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <2, 4, 9>
6. <3, 4, 7>
7. <3, 6, 7>
8. <4, 7, 8>
9. <4, 7, 5>
10. <6, 7, 8>

There are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the output should be [10].
