Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <1, 4, 8>
3. <2, 3, 6>
4. <2, 3, 9>
5. <2, 6, 9>
6. <3, 4, 7>
7. <4, 5, 7>
8. <4, 5, 8>
9. <4, 9, 7>
10. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
