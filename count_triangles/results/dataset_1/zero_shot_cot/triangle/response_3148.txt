Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other by edges.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <1, 5, 9>
2. <1, 6, 9>
3. <2, 3, 9>
4. <4, 7, 9>
5. <4, 8, 9>
6. <4, 9, 5>
7. <7, 4, 9>
8. <9, 1, 5>
9. <9, 1, 6>
10. <9, 3, 2>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
