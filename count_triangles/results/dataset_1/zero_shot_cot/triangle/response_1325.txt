Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Finding triangles in a graph involves looking for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's break it down step by step for this graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8.

Now, let's find the triangles in this graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 8, 9>
- Triangle 2: <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle 3: <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle 4: <2, 5, 1>
- Triangle 5: <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
