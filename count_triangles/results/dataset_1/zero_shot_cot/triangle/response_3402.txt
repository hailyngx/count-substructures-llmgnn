Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step by step:
1. Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
2. Edges: (0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 4)

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 2: <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle 3: <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle 4: <2, 1, 7>
- Triangle 5: <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle 6: <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle 7: <4, 5, 8>

Thus, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. So the total number of triangles is [7].
