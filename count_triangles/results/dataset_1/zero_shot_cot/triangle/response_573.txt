Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 3> is formed by edges (0, 3), (0, 2), and (2, 3).
2. Triangle <0, 2, 6> is formed by edges (0, 6), (0, 2), and (2, 6).
3. Triangle <0, 3, 6> is formed by edges (0, 6), (0, 3), and (3, 6).
4. Triangle <0, 4, 6> is formed by edges (0, 4), (0, 6), and (4, 6).
5. Triangle <0, 6, 9> is formed by edges (0, 9), (0, 6), and (6, 9).
6. Triangle <1, 7, 9> is formed by edges (1, 9), (1, 7), and (7, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
