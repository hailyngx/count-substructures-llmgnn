Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are interconnected.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 6, 9>
5. <2, 5, 6>
6. <2, 6, 7>
7. <5, 6, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
