Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Table of Connections:
   
   | Node | Neighbors            |
   |------|----------------------|
   | 0    | 4, 7, 8              |
   | 1    | 7, 9                |
   | 2    | 7                    |
   | 3    | 4                    |
   | 4    | 0, 3, 5, 6           |
   | 5    | 4, 7                 |
   | 6    | 4, 8                 |
   | 7    | 0, 1, 2, 5, 8        |
   | 8    | 0, 6, 7, 9           |
   | 9    | 1, 8                 |

2. Counting Triangles:
   
   - From the table above, we can observe the following triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.

3. Total Number of Triangles: 
   
   - The total number of triangles is [7].
