Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 1.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 2.

Now, we will find the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 1, 8>
4. <0, 3, 8>
5. <1, 2, 6>
6. <1, 4, 8>
7. <3, 0, 1>
8. <4, 1, 6>
9. <6, 2, 1>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in this graph. So, the total number of triangles is [9].
