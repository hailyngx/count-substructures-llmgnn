Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every unique set of three nodes that form a triangle. A triangle occurs when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Given the provided edges, let's go step by step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {1, 5, 6}
2. Nodes connected to node 1: {0, 2, 5, 7}
3. Nodes connected to node 2: {1, 4, 5}
4. Nodes connected to node 3: {4, 9}
5. Nodes connected to node 4: {2, 3, 6, 9}
6. Nodes connected to node 5: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
7. Nodes connected to node 6: {0, 4, 8}
8. Nodes connected to node 7: {1, 5, 8}
9. Nodes connected to node 8: {5, 6, 7}
10. Nodes connected to node 9: {3, 4}

Now, let's determine the triangles based on the connectivity mentioned above:

1. Triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, 5> and <0, 5, 6>
2. Triangles involving node 1: <0, 1, 5> and <1, 5, 7>
3. Triangles involving node 2: No triangles
4. Triangles involving node 3: No triangles
5. Triangles involving node 4: No triangles
6. Triangles involving node 5: <0, 1, 5>
7. Triangles involving node 6: No triangles
8. Triangles involving node 7: No triangles
9. Triangles involving node 8: No triangles
10. Triangles involving node 9: No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5> and <0, 5, 6>.
