Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the possible triangles:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <0, 5, 6>
5. <0, 5, 1>
6. <1, 4, 7>
7. <4, 7, 9>
8. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
