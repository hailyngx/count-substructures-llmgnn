Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
