Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique combinations of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's find the triangles and count them:

1. Possible Triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 2, 8)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 2, 5)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 2, 8)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 3, 6)
   - Triangle 5: (1, 3, 8)
   - Triangle 6: (2, 5, 6)
   - Triangle 7: (2, 5, 8)

2. Count of Triangles: [7]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 7.
