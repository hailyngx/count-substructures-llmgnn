Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>.
2. Triangle <0, 1, 6>.
3. Triangle <0, 1, 8>.
4. Triangle <0, 5, 6>.
5. Triangle <0, 6, 8>.
6. Triangle <1, 5, 7>.
7. Triangle <1, 6, 9>.
8. Triangle <5, 6, 7>.
9. Triangle <6, 7, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [9]
