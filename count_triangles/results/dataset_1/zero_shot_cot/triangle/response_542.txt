Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the triangle by checking each set of 3 nodes to see if they form a triangle. The formula for calculating triangles in a simple graph is given by: \( \binom{X}{3} \), where X is the number of common neighbors of two connected nodes. 

Let's check for triangles using each node as a common node:
1. Triangle with common node 0: (1, 2, 3), (0, 2, 6), (0, 3, 9).
2. Triangle with common node 1: (0, 2, 7), (1, 2, 7).
3. Triangle with common node 2: (0, 3, 4).
4. Triangle with common node 3: (0, 5, 9), (2, 5, 8), (4, 8, 9).
5. Triangle with common node 4: (2, 6, 9).
6. Triangle with common node 5: (3, 4, 8).
7. Triangle with common node 6: (0, 9, 4).
8. Triangle with common node 7: (1, 8, 2).
9. Triangle with common node 8: (3, 7, 4), (1, 7, 8).
10. Triangle with common node 9: (6, 0, 3).

Step 2: List unique triangles found:
<1, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<2, 7, 0>
<3, 4, 0>
<5, 9, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 3>
<9, 0, 6>
<8, 7, 1>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
