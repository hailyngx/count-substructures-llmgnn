Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the connected nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to count the triangles:

1. **Identifying triangles**:
   - Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
     - Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
     - Triangle 2: (1, 5, 6)
     - Triangle 3: (1, 6, 8)
     - Triangle 4: (2, 0, 1)
     - Triangle 5: (3, 6, 7)
     - Triangle 6: (3, 6, 8)
     - Triangle 7: (4, 6, 8)
     - Triangle 8: (6, 5, 9)
     - Triangle 9: (6, 7, 3)
     - Triangle 10: (6, 8, 1)
     - Triangle 11: (6, 9, 5)
     - Triangle 12: (6, 9, 8)
     - Triangle 13: (7, 0, 2)
     - Triangle 14: (7, 3, 8)
     - Triangle 15: (8, 1, 6)
     - Triangle 16: (8, 3, 6)

2. **Counting the number of triangles**:
   - There are 16 unique triangles identified in the given graph.

3. **Final Answer**:
   - The total number of triangles in the graph is **[16]**.
   - List of unique triangles found: 
     - <0, 2, 4>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 0, 1>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 8, 1>, <6, 9, 5>, <6, 9, 8>, <7, 0, 2>, <7, 3, 8>, <8, 1, 6>, <8, 3, 6>.
