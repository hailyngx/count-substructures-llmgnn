Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 1.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <1, 2, 8>
- Triangle 2: <1, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
