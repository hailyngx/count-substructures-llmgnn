Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7.
5. Node 5 is connected to node 4.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7.

To find the number of triangles, we need to look for nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
