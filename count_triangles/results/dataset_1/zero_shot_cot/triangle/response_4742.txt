Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that form a triangle by being directly connected to each other.

Let's list all the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <0, 4, 9>
5. <2, 5, 7>
6. <4, 5, 7>
7. <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
