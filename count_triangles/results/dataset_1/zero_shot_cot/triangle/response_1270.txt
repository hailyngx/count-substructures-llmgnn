Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming triangles.

Given the list of edges, let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 6>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
6. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
7. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
8. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
9. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
10. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
11. Triangle <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph.

The number of triangles is [11].
