Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can iterate through all possible combinations of three nodes and check if there is an edge between each pair.

2 triangles were found:
<4, 1, 6>
<9, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
