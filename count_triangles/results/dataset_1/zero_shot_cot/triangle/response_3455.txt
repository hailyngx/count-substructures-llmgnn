Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8.

Let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 3: <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle 4: <0, 4, 2>
- Triangle 5: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 6: <0, 6, 8>
- Triangle 7: <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle 8: <1, 3, 8>
- Triangle 9: <6, 8, 9>

There are 9 triangles in total. So, the answer is [9].
