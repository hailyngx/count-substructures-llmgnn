Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
We can start by listing all the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
5. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Count of triangles: [6]
