Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given graph:

```
    0 -- 2       4 -- 8
    |    |       |
    9 -- 1       |   
        |       |
        3       5 -- 7
                |   |
                6   2
```

Let's count the total number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes with the total number of edges connected to them:
   - Node 0: 2 edges
   - Node 1: 1 edge
   - Node 2: 5 edges
   - Node 3: 1 edge
   - Node 4: 1 edge
   - Node 5: 2 edges
   - Node 6: 1 edge
   - Node 7: 3 edges
   - Node 8: 1 edge
   - Node 9: 2 edges

2. For each node, find nodes that connect to a shared third node forming a triangle:
   - Triangle involving node 0: (0, 2, 9)
   - Triangle involving node 2: (0, 2, 7), (0, 2, 6), (0, 2, 9), (2, 7, 5), (2, 7, 6), (2, 7, 3)
   - Triangle involving node 5: (5, 7, 2)
   - Triangle involving node 7: (5, 7, 2)

3. List of unique triangles:
   - <0, 2, 7>
   - <0, 2, 6>
   - <0, 2, 9>
   - <2, 7, 5>
   - <2, 7, 6>
   - <2, 7, 3>
   - <5, 7, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
