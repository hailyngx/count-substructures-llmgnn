Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all the possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's list down the unique triangles and then count them.

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<8, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
