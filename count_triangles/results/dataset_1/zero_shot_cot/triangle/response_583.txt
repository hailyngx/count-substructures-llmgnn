Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for the triangles formed by the connected nodes.

Given the edges:
(0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7)

Let's list the triangles:
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 0>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 5, 1>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 9, 1>
<3, 9, 4>
<3, 9, 7>
<4, 9, 1>
<5, 1, 4>
<5, 1, 9>
<6, 3, 8>
<7, 0, 1>
<7, 1, 9>
<8, 2, 5>
<8, 2, 6>
<9, 3, 1>
<9, 3, 4>
<9, 3, 7>
<9, 4, 1>
<9, 7, 0>

Total number of triangles: [ 24 ]
