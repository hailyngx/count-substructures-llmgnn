Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph by listing the neighbors for each node:
0: 4, 6, 8
1: 5
2: 9
3: 4, 5
4: 0, 3, 8
5: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
6: 0, 5
7: 5
8: 0, 4, 9
9: 2, 5, 8

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in this graph: [12]

Next, let's list the unique triangles: 
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 8, 9>
<4, 3, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 0>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 5>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 9, 2>
<8, 4, 0>
<8, 9, 2>
