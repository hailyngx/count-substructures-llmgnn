Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
From the given graph, we can count the number of triangles present. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's list the triangles first:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle 4: <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle 5: <3, 4, 8>
- Triangle 6: <6, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
