Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are interconnected. In the provided graph, we can analyze the triangles by considering each possible combination of three nodes.

Let's start by listing unique triangles and then count the total number of triangles at the end:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <0, 6, 1>
5. <0, 6, 8>
6. <1, 4, 2>
7. <1, 6, 8>
8. <2, 4, 1>
9. <2, 4, 9>
10. <4, 1, 6>
11. <5, 0, 8>
12. <6, 0, 8>
13. <6, 1, 8>
14. <8, 5, 6>
15. <8, 5, 0>
16. <8, 6, 1>
17. <9, 2, 4>
18. <9, 7, 3>
19. <9, 7, 8>

Considering the above unique triangles, there are a total of 19 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [19].
