Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we can determine the number of triangles present. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 1.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

Now let's find the triangles:
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
