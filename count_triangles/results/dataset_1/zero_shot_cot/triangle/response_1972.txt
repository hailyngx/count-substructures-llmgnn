Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.

Now, let's find the triangles by looking at each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 3, 8>
2. Triangle 2: <2, 1, 8>
3. Triangle 3: <2, 7, 5>
4. Triangle 4: <3, 4, 9>

Therefore, in this graph, there are a total of [4] triangles.
