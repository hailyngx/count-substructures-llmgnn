Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There seem to be several unique triangles in this graph. Let's identify and count them:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle <7, 5, 8>

There are [9] triangles in total.
