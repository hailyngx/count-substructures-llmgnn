Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check for every unique set of three nodes that form a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <0, 6, 8>
5. <2, 3, 4>
6. <4, 6, 7>
7. <4, 6, 9>
8. <4, 7, 9>
9. <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
