Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by connecting three nodes. Let's look at each unique triangle:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 4, 5>
4. <0, 4, 8>
5. <0, 5, 6>
6. <0, 8, 9>
7. <1, 4, 8>
8. <1, 5, 6>
9. <2, 4, 5>
10. <4, 5, 8>

Hence, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
