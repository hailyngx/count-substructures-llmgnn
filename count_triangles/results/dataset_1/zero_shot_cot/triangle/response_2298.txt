Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 7, 2>
<1, 8, 3>
<1, 8, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
