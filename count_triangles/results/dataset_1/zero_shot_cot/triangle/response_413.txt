Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <1, 2, 9>
4. <1, 7, 9>
5. <2, 5, 8>
6. <2, 9, 3>
7. <3, 6, 9>

Counting the triangles: [7]
