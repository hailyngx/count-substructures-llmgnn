Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After analyzing the provided edges in the graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
