Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in a graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Each triangle consists of three nodes and three edges between those nodes forming a closed loop. 

Given the edges provided:
(0, 4, 1), (0, 4, 2), (0, 4, 7), (0, 7, 2), (1, 4, 2), (1, 4, 5), (2, 4, 7), (2, 4, 9), (2, 7, 6), (4, 5, 1), (4, 5, 8), (4, 1, 5), (5, 8, 6), (7, 6, 8)

This graph has 14 unique triangles:
<0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 2>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 7, 6>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 1, 5>, <5, 8, 6>, <7, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
