Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first find all the triangles in the given graph:

- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 4)  
- Triangle 2: (0, 7, 4)  
- Triangle 3: (0, 3, 7)  
- Triangle 4: (0, 3, 8)  
- Triangle 5: (2, 4, 7)  
- Triangle 6: (3, 4, 7)  
- Triangle 7: (3, 7, 8)  

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.  
Total number of triangles: [7]
