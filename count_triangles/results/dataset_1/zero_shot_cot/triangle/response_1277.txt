Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles and list them out, we can start by analyzing each node pair that shares a common neighbor. 

1. For node 0: (0, 3), (0, 9), (3, 9) - <0, 3, 9>
2. For node 1: (1, 6) - No triangles
3. For node 2: (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 9), (5, 8), (5, 9), (8, 9) - <2, 5, 9>, <2, 8, 9>
4. For node 3: (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (0, 4), (0, 6), (4, 6) - <0, 3, 4>
5. For node 4: (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (3, 5), (3, 7), (5, 7) - <3, 4, 5>
6. For node 5: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7), (2, 4), (2, 7), (4, 7) - Already counted in 4.
7. For node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3), (1, 3) - Corrected to <1, 3, 6>
8. For node 7: (7, 4), (7, 5), (4, 5) - Already counted in 4.
9. For node 8: (8, 2), (8, 4), (2, 4) - Already counted in 4.
10. For node 9: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 5), (0, 2), (0, 5), (2, 5) - Already counted in 1.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
