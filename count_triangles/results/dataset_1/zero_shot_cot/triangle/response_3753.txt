Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

First, let's list out the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <1, 2, 3>
5. <1, 3, 8>
6. <1, 3, 9>
7. <2, 1, 3>
8. <3, 4, 8>
9. <4, 7, 9>
10. <4, 8, 9>

There are a total of 10 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
