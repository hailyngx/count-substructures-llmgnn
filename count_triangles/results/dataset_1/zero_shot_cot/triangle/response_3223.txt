Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all pairwise connected. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 1.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7.

Now, let's list the triangles:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <7, 6, 8>

Hence, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
