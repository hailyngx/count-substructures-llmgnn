Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles by finding nodes that are connected to each other.
2. List the unique triangles found.

After going through the given edges, we can see the following triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle <1, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
