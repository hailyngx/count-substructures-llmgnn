Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected in such a way that they form a triangle.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <2, 3, 4>
4. <0, 2, 3>
5. <0, 2, 9>
6. <2, 4, 8>
7. <0, 6, 9>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
