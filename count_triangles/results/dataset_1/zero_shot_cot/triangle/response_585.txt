Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 7, 9>.
