Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in a graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes. Let's start by listing all the unique triangles in this graph:

1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <1, 2, 5>
3. <1, 2, 8>
4. <1, 5, 0>
5. <2, 1, 8>
6. <2, 3, 7>
7. <2, 3, 8>
8. <3, 0, 5>
9. <3, 2, 8>
10. <3, 4, 7>
11. <3, 4, 8>
12. <3, 7, 8>
13. <4, 2, 3>
14. <5, 0, 1>
15. <8, 1, 5>
16. <8, 2, 3>
17. <8, 3, 9>
18. <9, 3, 8>

There are a total of 18 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [18].
