Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 6, 4>
4. <1, 8, 9>
5. <2, 5, 8>
6. <2, 5, 1>
7. <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
