Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: degree = 5
- Node 1: degree = 5
- Node 2: degree = 2
- Node 3: degree = 1
- Node 4: degree = 5
- Node 5: degree = 3
- Node 6: degree = 2
- Node 7: degree = 6
- Node 8: degree = 3
- Node 9: degree = 2

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles by evaluating the nodes' connections.
- Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle: <0, 4, 7>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
