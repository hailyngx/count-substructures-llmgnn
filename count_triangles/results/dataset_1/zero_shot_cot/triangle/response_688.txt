Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by the nodes. Here is the step-by-step process to calculate the number of triangles:

1. Look for all possible triangles within the graph:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 2, 7)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 2, 9)
   - Triangle 3: (2, 5, 6)
   - Triangle 4: (3, 6, 9)

2. Count the number of unique triangles found:
   - There are 4 unique triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, and <3, 6, 9>.
