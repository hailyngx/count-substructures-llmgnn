Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <6, 8, 9>.
