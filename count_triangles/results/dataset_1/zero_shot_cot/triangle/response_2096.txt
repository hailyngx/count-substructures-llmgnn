Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we will count the total number of triangles present. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other creating a closed loop. Let's identify the unique triangles and then count the total number of triangles.

1. Possible triangles involving node 0: None
2. Possible triangles involving node 2: <2, 4, 6>
3. Possible triangles involving node 4: None
4. Possible triangles involving node 5: None
5. Possible triangles involving node 6: None
6. Possible triangles involving node 7: None
7. Possible triangles involving node 8: None
8. Possible triangles involving node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [1]
