Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph based on the provided edges, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the triangles by looking for nodes that form a cycle of length 3.
2. Check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Now, let's go through the process:

The unique triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 2, 5>,
<0, 5, 7>,
<1, 5, 7>,
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
