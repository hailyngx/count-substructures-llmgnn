Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's follow these steps:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.

Now, we will identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 8, 9>
2. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
