Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find all triangles in the given graph by identifying all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by three edges.

The possible triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 6, 9>
2. <1, 4, 6>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <1, 6, 9>
5. <2, 3, 8>
6. <2, 3, 9>
7. <3, 4, 6>
8. <3, 4, 9>
9. <6, 7, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [9]
