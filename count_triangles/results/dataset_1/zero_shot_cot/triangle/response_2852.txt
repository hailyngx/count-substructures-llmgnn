Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

If we examine the connections between nodes based on the given edges, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <1, 5, 8>
4. <1, 5, 9>
5. <2, 5, 9>
6. <4, 7, 9>
7. <5, 8, 9>
8. <5, 9, 0>
9. <5, 9, 2>
10. <5, 9, 8>
11. <9, 4, 7>
12. <9, 4, 5>
13. <9, 6, 2>
14. <9, 8, 1>

Therefore, there are 14 unique triangles in total. So, the output is: [14].
