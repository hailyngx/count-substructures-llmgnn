Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Check all possible triangles formed by the nodes connected through edges.
2. Count the total number of triangles.

Let's start by listing the possible triangles:

1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <1, 7, 9>
3. <3, 4, 6>
4. <3, 5, 9>
5. <3, 7, 9>
6. <4, 6, 0>
7. <5, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
