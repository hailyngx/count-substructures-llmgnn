Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges arranged in terms of nodes:
0: {2, 4}
1: {8}
2: {0, 3}
3: {2, 4, 6, 7}
4: {0, 3, 6}
6: {3, 4, 8, 9}
7: {3}
8: {1, 6}
9: {6}

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph.
There are a total of [4] triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <2, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>.
