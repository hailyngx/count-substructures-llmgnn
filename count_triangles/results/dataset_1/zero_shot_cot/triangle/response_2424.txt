Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine all possible triangles formed by three connected nodes. 

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
