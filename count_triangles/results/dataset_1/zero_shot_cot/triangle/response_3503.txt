Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles in the graph by identifying the nodes that form triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 8, 9)
- Triangle 2: (1, 2, 6)
- Triangle 3: (1, 7, 8)
- Triangle 4: (2, 5, 9)
- Triangle 5: (3, 4, 6)
- Triangle 6: (7, 9, 8)

Next, let's count the total number of triangles: [6].
