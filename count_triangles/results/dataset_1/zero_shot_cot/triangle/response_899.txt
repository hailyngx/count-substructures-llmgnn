Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>.
