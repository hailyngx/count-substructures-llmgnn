Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles found and count them:

1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 3, 2>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <1, 5, 8>
5. <1, 7, 8>
6. <2, 3, 5>
7. <2, 5, 8>
8. <3, 4, 5>
9. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
