Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's count the number of triangles present.

We can identify triangles by looking for nodes that are connected in a way that forms a closed loop of length 3.

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <2, 3, 6>
2. <2, 4, 6>
3. <2, 6, 8>
4. <3, 4, 6>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [4]
