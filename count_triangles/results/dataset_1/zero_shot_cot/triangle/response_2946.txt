Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will examine every triplet of nodes to see if they form a closed triangle.

The triangles in this graph are:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
