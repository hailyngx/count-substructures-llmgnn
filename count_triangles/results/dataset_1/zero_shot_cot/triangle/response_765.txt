Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's build an adjacency matrix based on the given edges:

```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
0   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  1
1   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0
2   0  0  0  0  1  0  1  0  0  0
3   0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0
4   0  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  0  0
5   0  0  0  1  1  0  0  0  0  1
6   0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0
7   1  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
8   0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1
9   1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  1
