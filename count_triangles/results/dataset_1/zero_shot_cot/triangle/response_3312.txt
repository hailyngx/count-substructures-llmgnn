Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each possible triangle formed by three nodes and check if they are connected by edges. Let's identify the triangles and count the total number of triangles step by step.

1. Triangles formed by nodes (0, 1):
   - (0, 1, 6)
   
2. Triangles formed by nodes (0, 2):
   - No triangles

3. Triangles formed by nodes (0, 3):
   - (0, 3, 4)
   
4. Triangles formed by nodes (0, 4):
   - (0, 4, 5)
   
5. Triangles formed by nodes (0, 5):
   - No triangles

6. Triangles formed by nodes (0, 6):
   - No triangles

7. Triangles formed by nodes (0, 8):
   - No triangles

8. Triangles formed by nodes (0, 9):
   - No triangles

9. Triangles formed by nodes (1, 2):
   - No triangles

10. Triangles formed by nodes (1, 3):
    - No triangles
    
11. Triangles formed by nodes (1, 4):
    - No triangles

12. Triangles formed by nodes (1, 5):
    - No triangles

13. Triangles formed by nodes (1, 6):
    - No triangles

14. Triangles formed by nodes (1, 8):
    - No triangles

15. Triangles formed by nodes (1, 9):
    - No triangles

16. Triangles formed by nodes (2, 3):
    - No triangles

17. Triangles formed by nodes (2, 4):
   - No triangles

18. Triangles formed by nodes (2, 5):
   - (2, 4, 5)

19. Triangles formed by nodes (2, 6):
   - (0, 2, 6)

20. Triangles formed by nodes (2, 8):
   - No triangles

21. Triangles formed by nodes (2, 9):
   - No triangles

22. Triangles formed by nodes (3, 4):
   - No triangles

23. Triangles formed by nodes (3, 5):
   - No triangles

24. Triangles formed by nodes (3, 6):
   - No triangles

25. Triangles formed by nodes (3, 8):
   - No triangles

26. Triangles formed by nodes (3, 9):
   - No triangles

27. Triangles formed by nodes (4, 5):
   - No triangles

28. Triangles formed by nodes (4, 6):
   - (0, 4, 6)

29. Triangles formed by nodes (4, 8):
   - No triangles

30. Triangles formed by nodes (4, 9):
   - No triangles

31. Triangles formed by nodes (5, 6):
   - No triangles

32. Triangles formed by nodes (5, 8):
   - No triangles

33. Triangles formed by nodes (5, 9):
   - No triangles

34. Triangles formed by nodes (6, 8):
   - No triangles

35. Triangles formed by nodes (6, 9):
   - (0, 6, 9)
   
36. Triangles formed by nodes (8, 9):
   - No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6] and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 9>.
