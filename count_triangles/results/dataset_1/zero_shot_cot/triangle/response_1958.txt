Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for every possible triangle by checking if each set of three nodes is connected to each other. Let's start by listing out the triangles we find:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 8, 6>
3. <2, 7, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
