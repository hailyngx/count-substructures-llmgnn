Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for cycles of length three, or in other words, sets of three nodes connected to each other.

Let's analyze the graph by examining each node individually:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.

Now we can identify the triangles based on the connections between nodes:
- Triangles involving node 0: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>
- Triangles involving node 1: <1, 3, 4>
- Triangles involving node 2: <1, 2, 9>
- Triangles involving node 3: <5, 6, 9>
- Triangles involving node 4: None
- Triangles involving node 5: None
- Triangles involving node 6: None
- Triangles involving node 7: None
- Triangles involving node 8: None
- Triangles involving node 9: <3, 6, 9>

So, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
