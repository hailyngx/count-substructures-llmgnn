Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's first list all the triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <1, 2, 5>
3. <3, 6, 8>
4. <4, 9, 5>
5. <7, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in this graph: [5].
