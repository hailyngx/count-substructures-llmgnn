Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for cycles of length 3, which represent triangles. Let's list the triangles first and then count the total number of triangles.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <3, 5, 8>
3. <3, 5, 9>
4. <3, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
