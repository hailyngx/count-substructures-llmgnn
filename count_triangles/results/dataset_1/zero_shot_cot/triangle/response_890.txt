Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
8. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
9. Triangle <4, 8, 9>
10. Triangle <4, 9, 6>
11. Triangle <8, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [11].
