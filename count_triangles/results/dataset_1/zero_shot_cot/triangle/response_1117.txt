Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze each set of three connected nodes and check if they form a triangle.

1. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
6. Triangle <3, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
8. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
9. Triangle <7, 9, 3>
  
Total number of triangles: [9]
