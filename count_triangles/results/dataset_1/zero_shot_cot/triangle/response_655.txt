Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the potential triangles:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
   - Node 3 is connected to node 7.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
   - Node 8 is connected to node 2.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.

2. Identify the unique triangles:
   - <0, 2, 9>
   - <2, 4, 6>

3. Calculate the total number of triangles: 2

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
