Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

After analyzing the given edges, we can visualize the triangles in the graph:

- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle 2: <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle 3: <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle 4: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 5: <3, 4, 5>
- Triangle 6: <3, 6, 9>

Hence, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
