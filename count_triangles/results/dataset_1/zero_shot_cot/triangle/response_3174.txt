Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles step-by-step.

1. From the given edges, let's identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 3)
   - Triangle 2: (3, 4, 9)

2. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3> and <3, 4, 9>.
