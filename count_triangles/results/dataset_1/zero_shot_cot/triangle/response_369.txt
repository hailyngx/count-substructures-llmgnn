Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every possible set of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step by step:

1. **Identify triangles:**
   - Triangle 1: Nodes (0, 3, 4) form a triangle.
   - Triangle 2: Nodes (0, 4, 6) form a triangle.
   - Triangle 3: Nodes (0, 5, 6) form a triangle.
   - Triangle 4: Nodes (1, 4, 6) form a triangle.
   - Triangle 5: Nodes (6, 8, 9) form a triangle.

2. **Count the total number of triangles:**
   - Total number of triangles = 5

3. **List of unique triangles:**
   - <0, 3, 4>
   - <0, 4, 6>
   - <0, 5, 6>
   - <1, 4, 6>
   - <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
