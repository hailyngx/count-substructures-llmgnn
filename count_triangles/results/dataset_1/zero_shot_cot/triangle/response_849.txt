Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's count the number of triangles:

Let's look for triangles by checking each combination of 3 nodes:
1. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
5. Triangle <6, 8, 4>
6. Triangle <6, 8, 7>

Counting them all, we find there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
