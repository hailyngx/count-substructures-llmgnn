Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph by looking for nodes that have mutual connections. 

Here are the triangles found in the graph: 
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<9, 1, 3>
<9, 4, 6>
<9, 4, 8>
<9, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
