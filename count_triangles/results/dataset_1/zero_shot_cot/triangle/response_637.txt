Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we can look for every set of three nodes that are fully connected. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected only to node 2.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.

Now, we can start finding the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle 2: <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle 3: <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle 4: <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle 5: <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. So, the output is [5].
