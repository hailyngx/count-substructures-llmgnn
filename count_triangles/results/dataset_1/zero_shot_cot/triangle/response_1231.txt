Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to each other in groups of three.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <1, 7, 9>
2. <1, 7, 8>
3. <2, 6, 7>
4. <2, 7, 8>
5. <1, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
