Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. By examining the edges, we see that the possible triangles can be formed by nodes: (0, 4, 6), (1, 3, 5), (1, 4, 5), (1, 5, 7), (2, 8, 9).

2. Counting the number of triangles:
   
   - <0, 4, 6>
   - <1, 3, 5>
   - <1, 4, 5>
   - <1, 5, 7>
   - <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
