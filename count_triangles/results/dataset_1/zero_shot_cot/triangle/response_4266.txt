Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of 3 nodes that form triangles. Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 4: <0, 2, 4>
2. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 5: <0, 3, 5>
3. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 9: <0, 4, 9>
4. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 6: <2, 5, 6>
5. Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 6: <3, 5, 6>
6. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 9: <4, 6, 9>
7. Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 9: <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 7, which can be represented as [7].
