Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [\<1, 2, 8\> <1, 2, 9\> <1, 8, 5\> <1, 9, 5\> <2, 3, 5\> <2, 7, 5\> <5, 6, 9\>]. There are a total of [7] triangles.
