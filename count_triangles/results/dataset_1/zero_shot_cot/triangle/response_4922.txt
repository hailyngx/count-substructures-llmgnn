Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<8, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [5]
