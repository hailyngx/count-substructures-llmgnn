Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here's a step-by-step process to count the number of triangles:

1. Nodes {0, 3, 8} form a triangle.
2. Nodes {2, 3, 5} form a triangle.
3. Nodes {2, 3, 6} form a triangle.
4. Nodes {4, 8, 9} form a triangle.
5. Nodes {7, 8, 9} form a triangle.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <4, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.

So, the total number of triangles is [5].
