Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's calculate this step by step.

1. From the given edges, we identify the triangles formed by checking for nodes that are connected to each other:

Triangles:
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 6, 0>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 9, 2>
- <3, 1, 7>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <5, 3, 1>
- <5, 3, 8>
- <5, 4, 7>
- <5, 8, 2>
- <8, 2, 9>
- <9, 0, 4>
- <9, 0, 2>
- <9, 5, 8>

Now, count the total number of unique triangles and output the result:

Total number of triangles: [15]
