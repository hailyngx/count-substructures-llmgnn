Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in this graph.

To count the triangles, we will look for each possible triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges.

We will then list the unique triangles found.

Here are the unique triangles:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
