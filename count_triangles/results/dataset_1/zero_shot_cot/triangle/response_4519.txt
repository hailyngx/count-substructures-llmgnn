Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here are the unique triangles in the given graph:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
