Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node pairs connected by edges:
   - (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9)
   - (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9)
   - (2, 4) (2, 9)
   - (3, 1)
   - (4, 2) (4, 6)
   - (5, 0) (5, 1)
   - (6, 0) (6, 4)
   - (7, 1) (7, 8)
   - (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7)
   - (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2)

2. Triangles can be formed using three nodes connected by edges. Let's find the triangles:
   - <0, 5, 1>
   - <0, 5, 6>
   - <0, 5, 8>
   - <0, 5, 9>
   - <0, 6, 4>
   - <0, 6, 5>
   - <0, 6, 8>
   - <0, 6, 9>
   - <0, 8, 1>
   - <0, 8, 5>
   - <0, 8, 6>
   - <0, 8, 9>
   - <0, 9, 5>
   - <0, 9, 6>
   - <0, 9, 8>
   - <1, 5, 0>
   - <1, 5, 7>
   - <1, 5, 8>
   - <1, 5, 9>
   - <1, 7, 1>
   - <1, 7, 8>
   - <1, 8, 0>
   - <1, 8, 5>
   - <1, 8, 7>
   - <1, 8, 9>
   - <1, 9, 0>
   - <1, 9, 5>
   - <1, 9, 8>

3. Counting the total number of unique triangles: [28]

Therefore, the total number of unique triangles in the given graph is [28].
