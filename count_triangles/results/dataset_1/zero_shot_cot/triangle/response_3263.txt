Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify triangles formed by each node.
- Node 0: (0, 5, 7)
- Node 2: (2, 7, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 5, 7), (3, 5, 9), (3, 6, 9), (3, 7, 8)
- Node 4: No triangles
- Node 5: (5, 0, 3), (5, 3, 6), (5, 3, 9), (5, 6, 9)
- Node 6: (6, 3, 5)
- Node 7: (7, 0, 2), (7, 2, 8), (7, 3, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 2, 3), (8, 3, 7), (8, 3, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 3, 5), (9, 3, 8)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles based on the identified triangles from each node.
- Total number of triangles = 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) + 3 (from node 7) + 3 (from node 8) + 2 (from node 9)
- Total number of triangles = 19

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
