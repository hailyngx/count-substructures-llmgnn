Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles present in the given graph. The triangles can be found by looking for nodes that are connected in such a way that they form a closed loop of three edges. Let's list the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <1, 5, 8>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <1, 6, 3>
5. <1, 4, 5>
6. <1, 7, 6>
7. <3, 5, 8>
8. <3, 6, 8>
9. <4, 5, 8>
10. <6, 7, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. We found 10 unique triangles. So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
