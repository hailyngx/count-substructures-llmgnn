Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected with each other. We will examine each triplet of nodes and check if they form a triangle based on the given edges.

Here are the unique triangles present in the graph:

<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 1>
<1, 8, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
