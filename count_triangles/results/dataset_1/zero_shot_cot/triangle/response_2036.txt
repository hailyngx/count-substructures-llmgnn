Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges in the graph. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <1, 2, 6>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <2, 5, 3>
7. <2, 5, 9>
8. <3, 5, 9>
9. <3, 6, 9>
10. <8, 4, 9>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
