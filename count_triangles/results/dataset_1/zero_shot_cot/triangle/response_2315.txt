Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 4 and 9.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 3 and 5.
3. Node 2 doesn't form any triangles.
4. Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 1, 4, 8.
5. Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, 5.
6. Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 1, 4, 9.
7. Node 6 doesn't form any triangles.
8. Node 7 doesn't form any triangles.
9. Node 8 doesn't form any triangles.
10. Node 9 forms triangles with nodes 0 and 5.

Now, let's list the unique triangles:
<0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the provided graph.
