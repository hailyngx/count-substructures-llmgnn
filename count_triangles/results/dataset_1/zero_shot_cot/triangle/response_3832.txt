Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by the edges. Here are the triangles and the total count:

Triangles:
1. <3, 4, 5>
2. <3, 5, 7>
3. <1, 9, 5>

Total number of triangles: [3]
