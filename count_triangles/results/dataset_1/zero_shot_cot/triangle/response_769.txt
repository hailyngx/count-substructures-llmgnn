Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the given edges, we can see that the triangles can only be formed through nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 because they are interconnected within these nodes.

2. Possible triangles can be formed by selecting 3 different nodes out of these nodes where each node is connected to the other two.

3. The possible triangles in this graph are:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 3, 5>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 2, 5>
   - Triangle 5: <1, 5, 9>
   - Triangle 6: <2, 6, 5>
   - Triangle 7: <3, 5, 9>
   - Triangle 8: <4, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 9: <5, 8, 4>
   - Triangle 10: <5, 9, 7>

4. Counting each unique triangle, we have a total of [10 triangles] in this graph.
