Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the definition that a triangle is a set of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two, we can identify the triangles in this graph. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

Step 1: List all possible triangles without repetitions:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 9, 8>

Step 2: Count the number of unique triangles: 14
