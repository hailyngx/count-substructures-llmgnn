Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 9>.
