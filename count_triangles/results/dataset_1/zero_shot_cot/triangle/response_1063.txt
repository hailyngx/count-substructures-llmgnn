Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. **Triangle 1:** (2, 5, 7)
2. **Triangle 2:** (2, 7, 9)

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is **2** [<2, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 9>].
