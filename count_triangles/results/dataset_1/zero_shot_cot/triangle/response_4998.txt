Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in an adjacency list format for better visualization:

0: [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]
1: [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9]
2: [1, 3]
3: [0, 1, 2, 4, 8]
4: [3, 6, 7, 8]
5: [0, 1, 9]
6: [0, 4]
7: [0, 1, 4]
8: [1, 3, 4, 9]
9: [1, 5, 8]

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph. We need to find all possible triangles formed by three connected nodes.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [7].
