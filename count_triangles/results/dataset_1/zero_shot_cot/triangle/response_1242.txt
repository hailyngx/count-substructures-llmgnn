Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify them by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Upon analyzing the provided edges, the triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <1, 4, 6>
4. <1, 4, 9>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <3, 4, 6>
7. <3, 4, 9>
8. <3, 5, 6>
9. <4, 6, 9>
10. <7, 1, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
