Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <0, 8, 2>.
