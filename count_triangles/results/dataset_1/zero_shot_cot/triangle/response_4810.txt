Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we will list out all possible triangles by examining each triplet of nodes in the graph and checking if they form a triangle.

The nodes given in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}

Triplet 1: (0, 1, 5) - Not a triangle
Triplet 2: (0, 1, 6) - Not a triangle
Triplet 3: (0, 1, 9) - Triangle <0, 1, 9>
Triplet 4: (0, 5, 6) - Not a triangle
Triplet 5: (0, 5, 9) - Triangle <0, 5, 9>
Triplet 6: (0, 6, 9) - Not a triangle
Triplet 7: (1, 5, 6) - Not a triangle
Triplet 8: (1, 5, 9) - Not a triangle
Triplet 9: (1, 6, 9) - Not a triangle
Triplet 10: (5, 6, 9) - Not a triangle

Now, counting the total number of triangles found from the above calculations:

[2] 

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2.
