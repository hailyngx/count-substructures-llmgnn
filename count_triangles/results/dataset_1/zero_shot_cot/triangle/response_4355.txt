Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, we can count the number of triangles by examining each possible set of three nodes that form a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other by edges. Here are the steps to count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Consider each node in the graph and check for triangles:
   - Node 0 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 1 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 0, 5, and 9.
   - Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 6.
   - Node 4 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 7 and 8.
   - Node 6 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 7 does not form any triangles.
   - Node 8 forms a triangle with node 9.
   - Node 9 does not form any additional triangles.

2. Count the total number of triangles:
   - The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

3. List the unique triangles found:
   - <0, 2, 5>
   - <2, 5, 8>
   - <2, 5, 9>
   - <3, 5, 8>
