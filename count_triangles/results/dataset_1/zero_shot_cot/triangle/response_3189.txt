Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. 

Let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 1>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
4. Triangle <0, 8, 6>
5. Triangle <0, 8, 3>
6. Triangle <0, 9, 6>
7. Triangle <1, 2, 3>
8. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
9. Triangle <3, 4, 6>
10. Triangle <6, 8, 3>
11. Triangle <6, 8, 9>
12. Triangle <6, 9, 7>
13. Triangle <7, 9, 5>

Hence, there are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
