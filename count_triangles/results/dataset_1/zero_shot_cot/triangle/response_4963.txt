Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to find all the triangles in the graph. A triangle is a set of three nodes where each node is connected to every other node in the set.

Let's list all the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <2, 3, 5>
4. <5, 7, 8>
5. <3, 5, 9>
6. <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
