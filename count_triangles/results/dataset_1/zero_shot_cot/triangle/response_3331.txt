Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look at each triplet of nodes and see if they form a triangle. Triangles are formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly in a cyclic manner.

Let's identify the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
4. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
5. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
6. Triangle <0, 7, 1>
7. Triangle <3, 6, 9>
8. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
