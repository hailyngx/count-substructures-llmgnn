Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify all the triangles present in the graph. A triangle is a set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down all the triangles present in the given graph:
1. Nodes 1, 4, and 6 form a triangle.
2. Nodes 2, 4, and 5 form a triangle.
3. Nodes 3, 5, and 9 form a triangle.
  
Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
