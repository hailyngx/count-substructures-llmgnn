Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are total of 12 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are:

<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 9, 6>
<5, 4, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
