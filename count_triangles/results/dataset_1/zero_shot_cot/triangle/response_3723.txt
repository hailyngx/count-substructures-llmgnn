Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <1, 3, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 5, 4>
6. Triangle <2, 7, 6>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
8. Triangle <4, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
