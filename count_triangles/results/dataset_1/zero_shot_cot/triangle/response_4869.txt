Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 8, 7>
<7, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 3>
<8, 9, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in this graph.
