Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by the edges provided. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Node connections based on the provided edges:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 9
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 9
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 9
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8

2. Identify the triangles:
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5>
   - Triangle <0, 2, 6>
   - Triangle <0, 5, 6>
   - Triangle <1, 2, 8>
   - Triangle <1, 2, 9>
   - Triangle <1, 8, 9>
   - Triangle <2, 7, 5>
   - Triangle <3, 2, 7>
   - Triangle <5, 6, 7>
   - Triangle <5, 7, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
