Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to identify and count the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {3, 9}
2. Nodes connected to node 2: {3, 6}
3. Nodes connected to node 3: {0, 2, 8}
4. Nodes connected to node 5: {9}
5. Nodes connected to node 6: {2}
6. Nodes connected to node 7: {8}
7. Nodes connected to node 8: {3, 7}
8. Nodes connected to node 9: {0, 5}

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle 2: <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle 3: <0, 3, 2>
- Triangle 4: <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle 5: <8, 3, 7>
- Triangle 6: <0, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
