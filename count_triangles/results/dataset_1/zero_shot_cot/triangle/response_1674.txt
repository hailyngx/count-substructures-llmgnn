Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2

Step 2: As the graph has 10 nodes, we will look for triangles involving each node.

Triangles involving Node 0:
- Node 0, 2 are connected. 

Triangles involving Node 1:
- Node 1, 2 are connected.
- Node 1, 5 are connected.
- Node 1, 6 are connected.
- Node 1, 7 are connected.

Triangles involving Node 2:
- Node 2, 5 are connected.
- Node 2, 6 are connected.

Triangles involving Node 3: 
No triangles with Node 3.

Triangles involving Node 4:
No triangles with Node 4.

Triangles involving Node 5:
- Node 5, 7 are connected.

Triangles involving Node 6:
- Node 3, 6 are connected.
- Node 6, 7 are connected.

Triangles involving Node 7:
- Node 7, 9 are connected.

Triangles involving Node 8:
No triangles with Node 8.

Triangles involving Node 9:
No triangles with Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 9.
The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 1>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 2>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
