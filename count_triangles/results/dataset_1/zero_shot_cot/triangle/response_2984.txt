Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. 

By examining the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <2, 4, 5>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <1, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
