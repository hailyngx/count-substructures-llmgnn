Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

After analyzing the given edges, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <1, 7, 9>
5. <5, 4, 8>
6. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
