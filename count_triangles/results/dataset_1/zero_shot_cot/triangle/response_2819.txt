Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph.

To find a triangle, we need three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's look for all possible triangles in this graph:

1. Nodes (0, 1, 2) - Not a triangle as node 1 and node 2 are not connected.
2. Nodes (0, 1, 4) - Triangle found: <0, 1, 4>.
3. Nodes (0, 1, 9) - Not a triangle as node 1 and node 9 are not directly connected.
4. Nodes (0, 2, 5) - Not a triangle as node 0 and node 5 are not directly connected.
5. Nodes (0, 2, 6) - Not a triangle as node 0 and node 6 are not directly connected.
6. Nodes (0, 1, 5) - Not a triangle as node 0 and node 5 are not directly connected.
7. Nodes (0, 1, 6) - Not a triangle as node 0 and node 6 are not directly connected.
8. Nodes (0, 4, 9) - Triangle found: <0, 4, 9>.
9. Nodes (1, 5, 7) - Not a triangle as node 5 and node 7 are not directly connected.
10. Nodes (2, 5, 6) - Not a triangle as node 2 and node 6 are not directly connected.
11. Nodes (3, 4, 6) - Not a triangle as node 3 and node 4 are not directly connected.
12. Nodes (3, 4, 9) - Not a triangle as node 3 and node 9 are not directly connected.
13. Nodes (4, 5, 6) - Triangle found: <4, 5, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
