Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

- Nodes 0, 1, 4 form a triangle: <0, 1, 4>
- Nodes 1, 4, 9 form a triangle: <1, 4, 9>
- Nodes 2, 5, 9 form a triangle: <2, 5, 9>
- Nodes 3, 4, 9 form a triangle: <3, 4, 9>
- Nodes 3, 5, 9 form a triangle: <3, 5, 9>
- Nodes 2, 3, 8 form a triangle: <2, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
