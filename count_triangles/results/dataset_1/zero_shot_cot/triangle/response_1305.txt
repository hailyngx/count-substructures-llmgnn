Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the graph and count the number of triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

Now, let's list out the triangles in the graph:
1. <2, 1, 4>
2. <2, 5, 3>
3. <2, 5, 4>
4. <2, 5, 8>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <4, 9, 7>
7. <5, 3, 2>
8. <5, 3, 4>
9. <5, 4, 7>
10. <5, 8, 2>
11. <5, 8, 6>
12. <7, 4, 9>
13. <7, 9, 6>
14. <8, 5, 2>
15. <9, 4, 7>
16. <9, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
