Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. Remember that a triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 3>
   - Triangle <0, 1, 5>
   - No additional triangles for node 0.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8.
   - Existing triangle <0, 1, 3>
   - Triangle <1, 3, 5>
   - No additional triangles for node 1.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
   - No new triangles involving node 2.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6.
   - Existing triangles <0, 1, 3> and <1, 3, 5>
   - Triangle <2, 3, 6>
   - No additional triangles for node 3.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
   - No new triangles involving node 4.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6.
   - Existing triangle <0, 1, 5>
   - No additional triangles for node 5.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
   - Existing triangle <2, 3, 6>
   - No additional triangles for node 6.

8. Node 7 is connected to node 2.
   - No new triangles involving node 7.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9.
   - No new triangles involving node 8.

10. Node 9 is connected to node 8.
   - No new triangles involving node 9.

By following the steps above, we found the following triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
