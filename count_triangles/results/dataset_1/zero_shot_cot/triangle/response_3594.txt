Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for loops of size 3 (triangles) formed by the edges. Let's count the number of triangles step by step.

1. Triangle formed by nodes (0, 1, 2)
2. Triangle formed by nodes (0, 2, 9)
3. Triangle formed by nodes (1, 2, 5)
4. Triangle formed by nodes (1, 2, 9)
5. Triangle formed by nodes (1, 5, 2)
6. Triangle formed by nodes (1, 5, 3)
7. Triangle formed by nodes (1, 8, 3)
8. Triangle formed by nodes (2, 5, 3)
9. Triangle formed by nodes (2, 6, 3)
10. Triangle formed by nodes (2, 9, 6)
11. Triangle formed by nodes (3, 5, 2)
12. Triangle formed by nodes (3, 5, 6)
13. Triangle formed by nodes (3, 8, 1)
14. Triangle formed by nodes (3, 9, 6)

There are 14 triangles in total. Therefore, the answer is [14]. The unique triangles found are:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <1, 2, 5>
4. <1, 2, 9>
5. <1, 5, 2>
6. <1, 5, 3>
7. <1, 8, 3>
8. <2, 5, 3>
9. <2, 6, 3>
10. <2, 9, 6>
11. <3, 5, 2>
12. <3, 5, 6>
13. <3, 8, 1>
14. <3, 9, 6>
