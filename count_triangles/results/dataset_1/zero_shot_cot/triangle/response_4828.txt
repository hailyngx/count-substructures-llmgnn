Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, and <4, 5, 6>.
