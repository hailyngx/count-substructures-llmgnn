Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
By counting the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Look for all possible triangles formed by choosing 3 vertices from the 10 nodes.
2. Check if there is an edge connecting each possible pair of vertices in the selected triangle, indicating the presence of a triangle.

Based on the provided edges, we can see that the triangles in the graph are as follows:

1. <0, 4, 2>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 6, 1>
4. <2, 3, 5>
5. <2, 3, 9>
6. <2, 5, 9>
7. <2, 6, 1>
8. <2, 6, 7>
9. <4, 8, 6>
10. <5, 3, 9>
11. <6, 1, 7>
12. <6, 8, 4>
13. <9, 1, 7>
14. <9, 5, 3>
15. <0, 4, 9>
16. <0, 6, 1>
17. <0, 6, 2>
18. <0, 9, 1>
19. <0, 9, 5>
20. <1, 9, 7>
21. <3, 2, 5>
22. <4, 0, 2>
23. <4, 2, 8>
24. <4, 6, 8>
25. <5, 2, 9>
26. <6, 0, 1>
27. <6, 0, 2>
28. <6, 2, 7>
29. <6, 7, 1>
30. <6, 7, 9>
31. <7, 1, 9>
32. <8, 4, 6>
33. <9, 0, 1>
34. <9, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [34].
