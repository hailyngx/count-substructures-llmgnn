Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a triangle. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8. So, we have triangles <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, and <0, 7, 8>.

2. Node 1 is connected to node 5. No triangles can be created with this setup.

3. Node 2 is connected to node 9. No triangles can be created with this setup.

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8. So, we have triangles <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, and <4, 7, 8>.

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 1. No triangles can be created with this setup.

6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8. So, we have triangles <6, 0, 4> and <6, 4, 8>.

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 4. No triangles can be created with this setup.

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6. So, we have triangles <8, 0, 4> and <8, 4, 6>.

9. Node 9 is connected to node 2. No triangles can be created with this setup.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <6, 0, 4>, <8, 0, 4>.
