Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: 6
2. Nodes connected to node 1: 7
3. Nodes connected to node 2: 4, 5
4. Nodes connected to node 3: 4, 6
5. Nodes connected to node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
6. Nodes connected to node 5: 2, 4, 8
7. Nodes connected to node 6: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
8. Nodes connected to node 7: 1
9. Nodes connected to node 8: 4, 5, 6
10. Nodes connected to node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's identify the triangles present in the graph:
- Triangle 1: Nodes 2, 4, 5
- Triangle 2: Nodes 4, 6, 8
- Triangle 3: Nodes 4, 6, 9

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] (found inside brackets). The unique triangles are <2, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 8>, and <4, 6, 9>.
