Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 1.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 1.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 1.

To find the triangles, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
