Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph.

To find a triangle, we need to look for three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go through the nodes and see how many triangles we can find:

1. (0, 4, 5)
2. (0, 4, 9)
3. (0, 5, 2)
4. (0, 4, 1)
5. (0, 4, 6)
6. (0, 9, 8)
7. (1, 4, 6)
8. (2, 5, 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 9, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
