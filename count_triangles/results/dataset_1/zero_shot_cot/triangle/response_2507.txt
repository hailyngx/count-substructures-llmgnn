Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list to easily visualize the connections between the nodes:
- Node 1: [2, 3, 5]
- Node 2: [1, 8]
- Node 3: [1, 5, 7, 8]
- Node 4: [7]
- Node 5: [1, 3, 6, 7, 9]
- Node 6: [5, 7, 9]
- Node 7: [3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
- Node 8: [2, 3, 7]
- Node 9: [5, 6]

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by connecting three nodes. A triangle consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two.

Let's calculate the total number of triangles: []
Let's list the unique triangles found:
- <1, 3, 5>
- <5, 6, 7>
