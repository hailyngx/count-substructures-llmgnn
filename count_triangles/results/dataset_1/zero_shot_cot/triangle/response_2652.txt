Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected. Let's list the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle 1: (2, 3, 6)
2. Triangle 2: (3, 5, 7)
3. Triangle 3: (2, 3, 6)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
