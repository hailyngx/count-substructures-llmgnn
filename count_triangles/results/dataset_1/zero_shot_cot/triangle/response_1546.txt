Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <5, 7, 9>

There are [9] triangles in the given graph.
