Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph based on the given edges, we can first identify the triangles formed by nodes in the graph. 

Let's list the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <1, 8, 4>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <2, 4, 9>
7. <2, 5, 1>
8. <2, 5, 8>
9. <4, 8, 9>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
