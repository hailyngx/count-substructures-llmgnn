Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, and <4, 7, 9>.
