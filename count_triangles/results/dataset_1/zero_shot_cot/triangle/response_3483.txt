Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:
1. Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 1, 8 <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle 2: Nodes 0, 1, 9 <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle 3: Nodes 1, 5, 6 <1, 5, 6>
4. Triangle 4: Nodes 1, 8, 6 <1, 8, 6>
5. Triangle 5: Nodes 2, 3, 4 <2, 3, 4>
6. Triangle 6: Nodes 3, 8, 4 <3, 8, 4>
7. Triangle 7: Nodes 3, 6, 4 <3, 6, 4>
8. Triangle 8: Nodes 1, 8, 0 <1, 8, 0>
9. Triangle 9: Nodes 1, 6, 0 <1, 6, 0>
10. Triangle 10: Nodes 1, 8, 3 <1, 8, 3>
11. Triangle 11: Nodes 6, 3, 4 <6, 3, 4>
12. Triangle 12: Nodes 1, 5, 9 <1, 5, 9>
13. Triangle 13: Nodes 8, 6, 4 <8, 6, 4>

Therefore, there are 13 unique triangles in the given graph. Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
