Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
1. First, let's represent the given graph in an adjacency list format for easier visualization:

```
1: [2, 7, 8]
2: [1, 4, 5, 8]
4: [2, 5]
5: [2, 4, 8]
7: [1, 9]
8: [1, 2, 5]
9: [7]
```

2. Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph. A triangle exists when there are three nodes connected forming a cycle.

3. Let's go through each <node pair> and check if there is a third node completing the triangle:

- <1, 2>: Potential triangle found <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 7>: No triangle found
- <1, 8>: No triangle found
- <2, 4>: No triangle found
- <2, 5>: Potential triangle found <2, 5, 8>
- <2, 8>: No triangle found
- <4, 5>: No triangle found
- <5, 8>: Potential triangle found <2, 5, 8>
- <7, 1>: No triangle found
- <7, 9>: No triangle found
- <8, 1>: No triangle found
- <8, 2>: Potential triangle found <1, 2, 8>
- <8, 5>: Potential triangle found <2, 5, 8>
- <9, 7>: No triangle found

4. Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 8>, <2, 5, 8>

5. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
