Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <1, 7, 8>
3. <3, 5, 8>

There are total [3] triangles in the graph.
