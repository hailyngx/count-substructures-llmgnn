Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's analyze the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 4, 5)
- Triangle 2: (1, 3, 5)
- Triangle 3: (2, 3, 4)
- Triangle 4: (2, 3, 9)
- Triangle 5: (2, 4, 7)
- Triangle 6: (2, 8, 9)
- Triangle 7: (3, 4, 6)
- Triangle 8: (4, 6, 7)

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
