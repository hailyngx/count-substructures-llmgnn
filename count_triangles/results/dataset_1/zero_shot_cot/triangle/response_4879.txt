Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected by edges.

Let's list the triangles we can find in this graph:

1. <1, 3, 4>
2. <1, 3, 7>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <2, 7, 3>
5. <2, 7, 6>
6. <3, 5, 8>
7. <3, 6, 7>
8. <4, 7, 6>
9. <5, 8, 7>

Total number of triangles: [9]
