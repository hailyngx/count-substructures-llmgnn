Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. 

1. Let's list all the triangles:
<0, 2, 5> 
<0, 2, 8> 
<0, 5, 8> 
<1, 3, 6> 
<3, 4, 5> 
<5, 6, 8>

2. Now, we count the total number of triangles found: [6]
