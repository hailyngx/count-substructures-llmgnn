Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Finding all unique triangles in the graph
Let's list out all the triangles in the given graph:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <0, 3, 4>
5. <0, 4, 5>
6. <2, 3, 4>
7. <2, 4, 7>
8. <2, 6, 9>
9. <3, 4, 5>
10. <4, 5, 8>
11. <5, 8, 9>

Step 2: Counting the total number of triangles
Since we have found 11 unique triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
