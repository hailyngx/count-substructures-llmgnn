Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
I will calculate the number of triangles present in this graph by examining all possible combinations of 3 nodes. Let's start the process:

For each node, we will look at all pairs of its neighbors and check whether an edge exists between them to form a triangle with the node.
The total number of triangles will be the sum of triangles formed by each node.
Let's list the unique triangles as we find them:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 5), (0, 5, 8)

2. Node 1: (1, 0, 2)

3. Node 2: (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 6)

4. Node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 2, 6), (3, 4, 6), (3, 6, 9)

5. Node 4: (4, 0, 2), (4, 0, 5), (4, 2, 6), (4, 2, 9), (4, 5, 6), (4, 5, 9)

6. Node 5: (5, 0, 4)

7. Node 6: (6, 2, 3), (6, 3, 4), (6, 4, 7)

8. Node 7: (7, 6, 8)

9. Node 8: (8, 0, 7), (8, 0, 9)

10. Node 9: (9, 3, 4), (9, 4, 8)

By counting the unique triangles listed above, we find that there are 14 triangles in total. Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [14].
