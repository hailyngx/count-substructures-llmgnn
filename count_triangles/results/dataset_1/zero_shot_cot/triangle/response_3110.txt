Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle 1: (1, 4, 2)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 4, 3)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 4, 9)
4. Triangle 4: (1, 2, 8)
5. Triangle 5: (1, 3, 8)
6. Triangle 6: (1, 8, 9)
7. Triangle 7: (2, 4, 3)
8. Triangle 8: (2, 4, 8)
9. Triangle 9: (3, 4, 8)
10. Triangle 10: (4, 1, 8)
11. Triangle 11: (4, 2, 8)
12. Triangle 12: (4, 3, 8)
13. Triangle 13: (4, 8, 9)
14. Triangle 14: (1, 8, 2)
15. Triangle 15: (1, 8, 3)
16. Triangle 16: (2, 8, 3)
17. Triangle 17: (7, 8, 9)

In total, there are 17 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the number of triangles inside brackets is [17].
