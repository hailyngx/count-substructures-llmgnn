Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by identifying unique triangles. Here are the unique triangles in the graph along with their vertices:

1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <2, 1, 3>
4. <3, 6, 9>

Count of Total Triangles: [4]
