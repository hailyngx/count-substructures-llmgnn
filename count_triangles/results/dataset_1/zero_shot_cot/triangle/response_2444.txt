Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 2 is connected to nodes 1, so there is a triangle <0, 2, 1>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8, so there is a triangle <1, 2, 8>.
3. Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 4, and 8, so there is a triangle <1, 7, 4>.
4. Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 6, so there is a triangle <1, 7, 6>.
5. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, so there is a triangle <2, 0, 1>.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 9, so there is a triangle <6, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
