Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's denote the nodes as follows:
Node 0: {3, 6, 7, 8}
Node 1: {8}
Node 2: {5, 9}
Node 3: {0, 7}
Node 4: {}
Node 5: {2, 8}
Node 6: {0}
Node 7: {0, 3}
Node 8: {0, 1, 5}
Node 9: {2}

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to find all the sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

Let's start by listing the possible triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
