Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Three nodes form a triangle if each node is connected to the other two nodes. Let's go step-by-step to count the number of triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges:

1. Node 0 can form triangles with nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1 can form triangles with nodes 0, 7, and 9.
3. Node 2 can form a triangle with nodes 7 and 9.
4. Node 3 can form a triangle with node 0.
5. Node 4 can form a triangle with node 7.
6. Node 5 can form a triangle with node 9.
7. Node 6 can form a triangle with node 0 and 9.
8. Node 7 can form a triangle with nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9.
9. Node 8 can form a triangle with node 9.
10. Node 9 can form triangles with nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's list down the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<9, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
