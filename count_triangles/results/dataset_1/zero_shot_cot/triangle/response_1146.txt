Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that form a connected triangle. We can see that there are three triangles in this graph: <3, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, and <5, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
