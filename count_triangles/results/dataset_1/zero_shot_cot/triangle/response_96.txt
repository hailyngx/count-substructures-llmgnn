Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify triangles formed by each node:

- Node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 4, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 4, 6)
- Node 2: (2, 0, 5)
- Node 3: (3, 6, 1)
- Node 4: Already counted in Node 0
- Node 5: (5, 2, 4)
- Node 6: Already counted in Node 1
- Node 7: Already counted in Node 0
- Node 8: (8, 4, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 7, 8)

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 0, 5>, <3, 6, 1>, <5, 2, 4>, <8, 4, 7>, <9, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
