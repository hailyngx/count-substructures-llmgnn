Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list down all the unique triangles first:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <1, 3, 9>
4. <1, 4, 8>
5. <2, 3, 9>
6. <4, 6, 8>
7. <5, 6, 9>
8. <8, 9, 2>
9. <8, 9, 3>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
