Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can check for each possible triangle using the given edges. Let's analyze the graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to Node 0: 3, 5
2. Nodes connected to Node 1: 9
3. Nodes connected to Node 2: 5
4. Nodes connected to Node 3: 0, 6, 9
5. Nodes connected to Node 4: 5, 9
6. Nodes connected to Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
7. Nodes connected to Node 6: 3, 5, 8, 9
8. Nodes connected to Node 7: 5, 8
9. Nodes connected to Node 8: 6, 7
10. Nodes connected to Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's find the triangles using these edges:
- Triangles involving Node 0: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangles involving Node 3: <0, 3, 6>, <3, 6, 9>
- Triangles involving Node 5: <0, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 7>
- Triangles involving Node 6: <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
