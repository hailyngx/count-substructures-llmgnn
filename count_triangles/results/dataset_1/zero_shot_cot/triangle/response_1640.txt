Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <1, 3, 6>
3. <2, 3, 7>
4. <2, 5, 7>
5. <5, 6, 9>
6. <3, 5, 9>
7. <3, 7, 9>
8. <2, 6, 9>
9. <1, 5, 6>
  
There are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
