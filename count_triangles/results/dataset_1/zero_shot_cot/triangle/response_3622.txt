Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Let's list the unique triangles found step-by-step:
1. <0, 6, 7>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <1, 3, 9>
6. <1, 4, 5>
7. <1, 4, 7>
8. <1, 5, 7>
9. <2, 7, 9>
10. <3, 4, 5>
11. <3, 4, 7>
12. <3, 5, 7>
13. <4, 5, 7>
14. <4, 7, 9>
15. <5, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [15]
