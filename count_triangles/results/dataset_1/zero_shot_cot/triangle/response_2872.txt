Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Looking at the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to node 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to node 3.

2. To form a triangle, we need to find sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. After analyzing the given graph, we find that there are three triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle 2: Nodes <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle 3: Nodes <3, 8, 9>

3. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
