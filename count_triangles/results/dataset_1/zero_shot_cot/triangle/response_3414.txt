Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we first need to look for all possible triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to Node 0: 8
2. Nodes connected to Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 9
3. Nodes connected to Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
4. Nodes connected to Node 3: 1, 2, 7
5. Nodes connected to Node 4: 5, 7
6. Nodes connected to Node 5: 1, 2, 4
7. Nodes connected to Node 6: 2
8. Nodes connected to Node 7: 3, 4, 8
9. Nodes connected to Node 8: 0, 2, 7
10. Nodes connected to Node 9: 1, 2

Now, we identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle 2: <2, 3, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
