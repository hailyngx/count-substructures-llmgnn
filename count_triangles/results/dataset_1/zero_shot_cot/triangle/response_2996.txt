Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify each unique set of three nodes that are all interconnected.

From the given edges, the triangles in the graph can be represented as:

1. <0, 7, 8>
2. <1, 7, 9>
3. <2, 7, 4>
4. <4, 6, 7>
5. <6, 4, 5>
6. <6, 5, 9>
7. <6, 7, 4>
8. <7, 0, 1>
9. <7, 1, 9>
10. <7, 2, 4>

So, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
