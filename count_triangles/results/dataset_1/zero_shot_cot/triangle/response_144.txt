Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other forming a closed loop.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (1, 3, 5)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 3, 7)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 5, 7)
4. Triangle 4: (3, 5, 7)
5. Triangle 5: (1, 3, 8)
6. Triangle 6: (1, 5, 8)
7. Triangle 7: (3, 5, 8)
8. Triangle 8: (3, 7, 8)
9. Triangle 9: (5, 7, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 8>.
