Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed by three nodes connected in such a way that each node is connected to the other two.

Given the graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will analyze the connection between nodes to find triangles. Let's list the unique triangles found:

1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <1, 9, 4>
4. <2, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
