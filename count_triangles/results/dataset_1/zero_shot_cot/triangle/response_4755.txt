Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected.

Analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 5, 9>
2. <1, 2, 4>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <3, 4, 8>
5. <3, 4, 7>
6. <5, 6, 7>
7. <5, 6, 9>
8. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
