Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected with each other. Let's break it down step by step.

Given edges:
- (0, 3) (0, 9) 
- (1, 2)
- (2, 1) (2, 6)
- (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8)
- (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9)
- (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9)
- (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4)
- (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9)
- (8, 3) (8, 7)
- (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7)

Now, let's list down the triangles that can be formed:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <2, 6, 4>
3. <5, 7, 9>

Count of triangles in the graph: [3]
