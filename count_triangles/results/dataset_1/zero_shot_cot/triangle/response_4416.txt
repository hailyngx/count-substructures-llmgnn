Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to node 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 1.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6.

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
