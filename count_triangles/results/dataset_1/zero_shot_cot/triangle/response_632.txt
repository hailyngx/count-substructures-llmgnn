Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
- (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (4, 2), (5, 7), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 7)

Let's identify the triangles in this graph.

The triangles are:
1. <1, 6, 9>
2. <2, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
