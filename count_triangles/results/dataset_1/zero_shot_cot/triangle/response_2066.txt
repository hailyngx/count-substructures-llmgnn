Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
The unique triangles are <1, 3, 2>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 8, 5>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 1, 9>, <9, 7, 4>.
