Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's go step-by-step to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. The graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges.
2. Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. In this case, we will look for sets of three nodes that have edges between all pairs of nodes in the set.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: (2, 5, 6)
- Triangle 2: (2, 5, 7)
- Triangle 3: (2, 6, 7)
- Triangle 4: (3, 5, 6)
- Triangle 5: (3, 5, 7)
- Triangle 6: (3, 6, 7)

Now, counting the total number of triangles in the graph, we have found 6 unique triangles. So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
