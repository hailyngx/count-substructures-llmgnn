Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
