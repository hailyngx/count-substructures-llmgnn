Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the steps to count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 5> is present.
2. Triangle <1, 2, 7> is present.
3. Triangle <1, 3, 7> is present.
4. Triangle <2, 6, 7> is present.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
