Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
In order to find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by connected nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8)
2. Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 9)
3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 5)
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 9)
6. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3)
7. Node 6: (6, 4)
8. Node 7: (7, 1)
9. Node 8: (8, 0)
10. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4)

Now, let's list the unique triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <2, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
