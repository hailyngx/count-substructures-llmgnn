Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow a step-by-step approach:

1. Identify triangles formed by nodes connected by edges:
   - Triangles can be formed by nodes connected by edges. For each node pair connected by an edge, we check if there exists a third node that is connected to both nodes. If such a third node exists, a triangle is formed.

2. Check for triangles:
   - For each pair of nodes connected by an edge, we check if there is a third node connected to both nodes involved in the edge. We identify the triangles accordingly.

Following this approach, we can count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles found. Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

There are [6] triangles in the given graph, which are: 
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 8, 4>.
