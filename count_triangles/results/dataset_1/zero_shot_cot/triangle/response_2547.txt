Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in a graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's analyze the given graph step by step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <1, 4, 5>
- Triangle 2: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 3: <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle 4: <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle 5: <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle 6: <5, 6, 7>
- Triangle 7: <5, 6, 8>
- Triangle 8: <6, 7, 9>
- Triangle 9: <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [9].
