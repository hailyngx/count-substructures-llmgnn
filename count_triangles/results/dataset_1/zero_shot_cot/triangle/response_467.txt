Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and itself.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5.

Now, let's identify the triangles in this graph:

- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle 3: <0, 7, 6>
- Triangle 4: <2, 0, 5>
- Triangle 5: <2, 5, 0>
- Triangle 6: <5, 0, 8>
- Triangle 7: <5, 8, 0>
- Triangle 8: <0, 7, 1>
- Triangle 9: <1, 7, 4>
- Triangle 10: <7, 4, 3>
- Triangle 11: <4, 3, 1>
- Triangle 12: <5, 6, 7>
- Triangle 13: <6, 7, 0>
- Triangle 14: <5, 0, 2>
- Triangle 15: <7, 0, 8>

There are a total of 15 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [15].
