Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 6:
   - <0, 1, 6>

2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 0, 2, 3:
   - <0, 1, 2>
   - <0, 1, 3>
   
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 1, 7:
   - <1, 2, 7>

4. Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 1, 4, 7, 8:
   - <1, 3, 4>
   - <1, 3, 7>

5. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 0, 7:
   - <0, 6, 7>

6. Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 2, 3, 6:
   - <2, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [6].
