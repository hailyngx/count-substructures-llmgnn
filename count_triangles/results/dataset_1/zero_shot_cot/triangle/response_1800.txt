Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: 3 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 2: 3 edges
- Node 3: 2 edges
- Node 4: 2 edges
- Node 5: 3 edges
- Node 6: 4 edges
- Node 7: 2 edges
- Node 8: 3 edges
- Node 9: 4 edges

Step 2: Check for triangles:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <2, 8, 9>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <6, 4, 5>
- <6, 4, 9>
- <6, 5, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 9]
