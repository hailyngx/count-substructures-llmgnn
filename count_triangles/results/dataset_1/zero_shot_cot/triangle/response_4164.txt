Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by listing the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 3, 7>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 5, 7>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 6, 9>
4. Triangle 4: <2, 5, 7>
5. Triangle 5: <2, 6, 7>
6. Triangle 6: <4, 5, 7>
7. Triangle 7: <4, 6, 7>
8. Triangle 8: <5, 9, 7>
9. Triangle 9: <6, 8, 7>
10. Triangle 10: <6, 9, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
