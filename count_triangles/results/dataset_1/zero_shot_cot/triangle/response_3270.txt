Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming triangles. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.

Based on the connections described, the triangles in the graph can be formed by the following node combinations:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
