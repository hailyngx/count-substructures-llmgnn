Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles and list them out, we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the triangles by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular manner.
Step 2: List out the unique triangles found.
Step 3: Count the total number of triangles.

Based on the given graph, the triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 0>
<4, 7, 3>
<2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
