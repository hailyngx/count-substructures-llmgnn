Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine every triplet of nodes and check if they form a triangle. A triangle is formed when all three nodes in the triplet are mutually connected to each other.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is directly connected to Node 4: (0, 4)
2. Node 1 is directly connected to Node 3 and Node 9: (1, 3), (1, 9)
3. Node 2 is directly connected to Node 3, Node 6, and Node 8: (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8)
4. Node 3 is directly connected to Node 1, Node 2, and Node 8: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8)
5. Node 4 is directly connected to Node 0 and Node 6: (4, 0), (4, 6)
6. Node 5 is directly connected to Node 9: (5, 9)
7. Node 6 is directly connected to Node 2 and Node 4: (6, 2), (6, 4)
8. Node 8 is directly connected to Node 2, Node 3, and Node 9: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 9)
9. Node 9 is directly connected to Node 1, Node 5, and Node 8: (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the triangles:

Potential triangles involving each node:
- Node 0: None
- Node 1: <1, 3, 9>
- Node 2: None
- Node 3: None
- Node 4: None
- Node 5: None
- Node 6: None
- Node 8: None
- Node 9: None

From the potential triangles list, there is only one triangle: <1, 3, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
