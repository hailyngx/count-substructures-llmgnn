Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected.

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
1. <1, 3, 4>
2. <1, 4, 6>
3. <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
