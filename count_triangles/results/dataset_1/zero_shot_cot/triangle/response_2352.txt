Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph as an adjacency list for better visualization:

0: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9]
1: [0, 7, 9]
2: [0, 6]
3: [5, 9]
4: [0, 5, 7]
5: [0, 3, 4, 9]
6: [0, 2, 7, 8]
7: [1, 4, 6]
8: [6, 9]
9: [0, 1, 3, 5, 8]

Now, let's find the triangles in this graph:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <0, 6, 9>

Thus, there are total of [4] triangles in this graph.
