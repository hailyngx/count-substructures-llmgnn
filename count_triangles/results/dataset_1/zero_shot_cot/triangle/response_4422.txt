Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of 3 nodes that are all interconnected with each other.

Let's list the triangles we can find in this graph:

1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <1, 5, 8>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <3, 5, 9>
5. <6, 7, 9>
6. <7, 8, 9>

Counting the triangles, we find that there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
