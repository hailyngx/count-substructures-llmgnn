Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 ---- 2 ---- 4
|      |      |
|      |      |
3 ---- 6      |
|             |
|             |
1 ---- 7 ----- 9
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's first list down the unique triangles present in the graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
