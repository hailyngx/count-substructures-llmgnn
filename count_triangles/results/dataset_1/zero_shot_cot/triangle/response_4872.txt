Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all possible unique sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
4. Triangle <3, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **5**.  
The unique triangles found are: [<0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>].

So, the output is: **[5]**
