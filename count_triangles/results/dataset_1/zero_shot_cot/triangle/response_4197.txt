Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all the triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's go through the given graph and identify the unique triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 3>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle 3: <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle 4: <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 6: <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle 7: <4, 5, 8>

Thus, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
