Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 8>.
