Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
From the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <2, 3, 4>
3. <3, 4, 7>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <3, 6, 4>
6. <3, 6, 5>
7. <4, 6, 5>
8. <7, 3, 4>
9. <9, 3, 4>
10. <9, 3, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
