Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be determined by identifying unique triangles formed by three interconnected nodes. Let's calculate the number of triangles step by step.

1. From the given edges, let's identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 3, 6)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 3, 8)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 3, 6)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 3, 6)
   - Triangle 6: (2, 3, 8)
   - Triangle 7: (2, 5, 6)
   - Triangle 8: (3, 5, 6)
   - Triangle 9: (3, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 10: (4, 6, 8)

2. Count the total number of triangles and list them uniquely:
   - Total number of triangles: [10]
   - Unique triangles: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>
