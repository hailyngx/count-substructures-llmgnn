Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node in the graph:
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 2
- Node 2: degree = 5
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 2
- Node 5: degree = 3
- Node 6: degree = 3
- Node 7: degree = 1
- Node 8: degree = 2
- Node 9: degree = 4

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles by examining each possible triangle:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle <3, 8, 9>
- Total number of triangles = 7
