Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by 3 interconnected nodes. Let's list the unique triangles below and then calculate the total number of triangles:

1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <2, 4, 5>
5. <2, 5, 7>
6. <3, 5, 7>
7. <3, 5, 9>
8. <5, 7, 9>
9. <8, 3, 9>

There are a total of 9 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
