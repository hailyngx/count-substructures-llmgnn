Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected. We can do this by examining each possible group of three nodes and checking if there is an edge between each pair in the group.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 1, 7>
4. <0, 2, 4>
5. <1, 2, 7>
6. <1, 4, 7>
7. <1, 4, 8>
8. <2, 4, 9>
9. <3, 4, 5>
10. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
