Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the steps we can take:

1. Find all triangles by examining each set of 3 nodes:
   - Possible triangle combinations:
     - (0, 1, 7)
     - (0, 2, 4)
     - (0, 3, 4)
     - (0, 7, 8)
     - (3, 4, 5)
     - (4, 5, 6)
     - (4, 7, 9)

2. Count the total number of triangles found.

3. List each unique triangle found.

Let's go through the possible triangles and identify the unique ones:

- Unique triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
