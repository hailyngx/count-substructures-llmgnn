Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <2, 6, 9>
2. <2, 8, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
