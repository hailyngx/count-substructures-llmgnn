Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

Step 1: We will list down all triangles by checking all possible combinations of nodes connected by edges.

Triangles:
1. <0, 8, 5>
2. <0, 8, 6>
3. <1, 3, 4>
4. <4, 7, 6>
5. <6, 7, 4>
6. <8, 0, 5>
7. <8, 0, 6>
8. <8, 5, 6>
9. <7, 4, 3>
10. <7, 4, 6>
11. <7, 3, 4>
12. <7, 6, 8>
13. <8, 6, 7>

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles.
[13] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 13.
