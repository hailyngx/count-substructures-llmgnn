Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges provided.

Let's go step by step:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <2, 5, 9>
4. <2, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
