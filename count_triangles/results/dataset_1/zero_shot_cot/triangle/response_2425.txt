Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
I will determine the number of triangles in this graph by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 9 (0-9).
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7 (1-2, 1-4, 1-7).
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7 (2-1, 2-7).
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9 (3-6, 3-7, 3-9).
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 9 (4-1, 4-6, 4-7, 4-9).
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8 (5-6, 5-7, 5-8).
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 7 (6-3, 6-4, 6-5, 6-7).
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (7-1, 7-2, 7-3, 7-4, 7-5, 7-6).
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 9 (8-5, 8-9).
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8 (9-0, 9-3, 9-4, 9-8).

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (1, 2, 4)
- Triangle 2: (4, 6, 7)
- Triangle 3: (6, 7, 3)
- Triangle 4: (3, 9, 4)
- Triangle 5: (5, 6, 7)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
