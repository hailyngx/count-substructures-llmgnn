Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can check all possible combinations of 3 nodes and see if they form a triangle by having edges between each pair of nodes.

By analyzing the given edges, we can see that the triangles in this graph are:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [2].
