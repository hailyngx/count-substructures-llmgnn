Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes. This can be achieved by finding all the possible triangles formed by the edges given. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 9, 4>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 5, 9>
<7, 4, 9>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 6>
<2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
