Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. Let's list out the triangles first:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <0, 5, 6>
5. <2, 5, 9>
6. <3, 5, 6>
7. <4, 5, 9>
8. <6, 4, 9>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
