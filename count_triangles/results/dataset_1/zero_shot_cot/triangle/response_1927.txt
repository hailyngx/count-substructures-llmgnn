Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <1, 4, 8>
2. <1, 8, 4>
3. <4, 5, 8>
4. <4, 6, 8>
5. <5, 6, 8>
6. <3, 4, 7>
7. <3, 7, 5>
8. <3, 4, 8>
9. <7, 4, 5>
10. <0, 1, 9>
11. <0, 9, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [11].
