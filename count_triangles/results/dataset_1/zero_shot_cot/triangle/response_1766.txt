Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 8.

Now, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <0, 6, 8>.
2. Triangle <6, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
