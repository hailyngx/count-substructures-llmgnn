Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
4. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
6. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
8. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
9. Triangle <5, 7, 8>
10. Triangle <8, 9, 4>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
