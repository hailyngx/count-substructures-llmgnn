Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected.

First, let's list all the triangles in the graph:
1. <1, 4, 7>
2. <1, 7, 8>
3. <2, 3, 6>
4. <2, 3, 7>
5. <2, 6, 7>
6. <3, 4, 7>
7. <3, 6, 8>
8. <3, 9, 2>
9. <3, 9, 4>
10. <6, 1, 4>
11. <6, 2, 7>
12. <6, 3, 8>
13. <8, 1, 4>
14. <8, 1, 6>
15. <8, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are 15 unique triangles in the graph. So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
