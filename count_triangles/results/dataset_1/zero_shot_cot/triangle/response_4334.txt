Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

To form a triangle, we need 3 nodes that are all connected to each other. 

From the given graph, we can see the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 4, 8>
3. <1, 4, 6>
4. <2, 3, 7>
5. <2, 3, 9>
6. <2, 7, 8>
7. <4, 8, 9>
8. <6, 4, 9>
9. <9, 5, 6>
10. <9, 8, 2>
11. <9, 8, 4>
12. <9, 8, 1>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
