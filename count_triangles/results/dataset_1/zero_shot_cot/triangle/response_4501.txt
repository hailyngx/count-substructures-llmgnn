Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are connected by edges to each other. Let's start by listing out the triangles:

1. <0, 4, 1>
2. <0, 4, 2>
3. <0, 5, 2>
4. <0, 6, 2>
5. <1, 4, 2>
6. <1, 9, 6>
7. <2, 1, 4>
8. <2, 5, 0>
9. <2, 5, 6>
10. <2, 6, 3>
11. <2, 6, 7>
12. <2, 6, 9>
13. <3, 6, 9>
14. <4, 1, 2>
15. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.
