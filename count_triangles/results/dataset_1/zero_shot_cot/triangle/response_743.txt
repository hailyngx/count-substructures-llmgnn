Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 0.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 0.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.

To find the triangles, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
