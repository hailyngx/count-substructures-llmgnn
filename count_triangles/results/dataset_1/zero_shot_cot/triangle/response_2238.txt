Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all the triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other to form a closed loop of three nodes.
2. Count each unique triangle only once.
3. Provide the total number of triangles found in the graph.

Here are the triangles identified in the given graph:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <1, 2, 4>
4. <2, 3, 5>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
