Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
From the given information, we can see that the graph consists of the following edges:
(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 9), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 9), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 7), (6, 8), (7, 9)

Let's calculate the total number of triangles formed in this graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. We will list the unique triangles found.

[Total number of triangles: 2]
1. <1, 6, 8>
2. <3, 6, 8>
