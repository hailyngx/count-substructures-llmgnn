Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle <0, 2, 3>
- Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle <3, 5, 8>
- Triangle <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle <8, 1, 2>
- Triangle <8, 2, 3>
  
Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
