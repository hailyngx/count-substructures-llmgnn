Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges.

Starting with the provided edges:
- (0, 3) forms a triangle with edge (3, 6): <0, 3, 6>
- (3, 6) forms a triangle with edge (6, 9): <3, 6, 9>
- (3, 9) forms a triangle with edge (9, 6): <3, 9, 6>
- (2, 7) does not form a triangle as it does not have any common vertices with other edges
- (5, 7) does not form a triangle as it does not have any common vertices with other edges

Counting the unique triangles found:
- <0, 3, 6>
- <3, 6, 9>

Hence, there are 2 triangles in total in the given graph [2].
