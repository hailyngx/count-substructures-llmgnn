Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly or indirectly. Here is the list of triangles found in the graph:

1. <1, 4, 7>
2. <1, 3, 7>
3. <1, 7, 2>
4. <3, 5, 7>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <4, 5, 6>
7. <4, 8, 7>
8. <7, 5, 3>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph. 

The total number of triangles in the given graph is: [8]
