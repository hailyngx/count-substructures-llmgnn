Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Three nodes connected in the form of a triangle will create a unique triangle. Let's go step-by-step to identify and count the triangles:

1. Look for triangles connected by three edges:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 5, 2)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 5, 7)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 7, 2)
   
2. Calculate the total number of unique triangles found:
   - Total number of triangles = 3
   
 Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
