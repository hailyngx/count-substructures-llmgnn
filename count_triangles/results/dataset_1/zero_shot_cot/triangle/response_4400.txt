Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Looking at the edges, we can see the triangles can be formed by nodes that are interconnected.

2. We start by identifying the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 4, 9)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 5, 8)
   - Triangle 4: (4, 5, 8)
   - Triangle 5: (4, 5, 6)
   - Triangle 6: (4, 6, 9)
   - Triangle 7: (4, 9, 0)
   - Triangle 8: (5, 8, 3)
   - Triangle 9: (5, 8, 9)
   - Triangle 10: (5, 9, 0)
   - Triangle 11: (6, 4, 9)
   - Triangle 12: (9, 0, 4)
   - Triangle 13: (9, 0, 2)
   - Triangle 14: (9, 0, 5)
   - Triangle 15: (9, 2, 7)
   - Triangle 16: (9, 6, 4)
   - Triangle 17: (9, 6, 7)

3. Counting the total number of unique triangles found: [17]

Therefore, there are a total of 17 triangles in the given graph.
