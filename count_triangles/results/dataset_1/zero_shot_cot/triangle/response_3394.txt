Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's list out the unique triangles and then count them.

Unique triangles in the graph:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
[4 unique triangles]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
