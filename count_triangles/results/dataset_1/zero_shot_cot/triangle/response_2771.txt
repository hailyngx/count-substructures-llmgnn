Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles that exist within the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in such a way that there is an edge between each pair of nodes.

Let's list down the unique triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <2, 3, 5>
4. <3, 4, 6>
5. <5, 6, 9>
6. <8, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
