Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Look for triangles formed by nodes connected by edges:
   - Triangle <0, 1, 5>
   - Triangle <1, 3, 5>
   - Triangle <1, 5, 7>
   - Triangle <1, 5, 2>
   - Triangle <3, 5, 7>
   - Triangle <3, 5, 2>
   - Triangle <4, 9, 2>
   - Triangle <6, 3, 9>
   - Triangle <6, 5, 7>
   - Triangle <9, 4, 2>
   
2. There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 2>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 2>, <4, 9, 2>, <6, 3, 9>, <6, 5, 7>, <9, 4, 2>.
