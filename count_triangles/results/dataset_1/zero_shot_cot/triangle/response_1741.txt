Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Let's first consider each node and find all possible triangles that can be formed with it.
- Node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 8), (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 8), (0, 4, 8)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 5), (1, 4, 5)
- Node 2: No triangles
- Node 3: No triangles
- Node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 9), (4, 1, 5), (4, 1, 9)
- Node 5: No triangles
- Node 6: No triangles
- Node 7: No triangles
- Node 8: (8, 0, 2), (8, 0, 6), (8, 0, 9), (8, 2, 6), (8, 6, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 4, 7), (9, 4, 8), (9, 7, 8)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles by looking at the unique triangles found in Step 1.
- Total number of triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, <8, 0, 2>, <8, 0, 6>, <8, 0, 9>, <8, 2, 6>, <8, 6, 9>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 4, 8>, <9, 7, 8>
- Total number of triangles: [14]
