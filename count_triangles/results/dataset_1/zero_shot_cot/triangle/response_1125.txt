Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's consider all possible triangles formed by the edges provided.

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
0 - A
1 - B
2 - C
3 - D
4 - E
5 - F
6 - G
7 - H
8 - I
9 - J

Now, we can identify the triangles using the given edges:
1. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 1, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
6. Triangle <4, 0, 7>
7. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
8. Triangle <7, 0, 4>
9. Triangle <7, 0, 8>
10. Triangle <7, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
