Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find the number of triangles:

Node 0: Neighbors [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Node 1: Neighbors [5]
Node 2: Neighbors [0, 4, 5, 9]
Node 3: Neighbors [6, 8, 9]
Node 4: Neighbors [0, 2, 5, 9]
Node 5: Neighbors [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]
Node 6: Neighbors [0, 3, 5]
Node 7: Neighbors [0, 8]
Node 8: Neighbors [0, 3, 7]
Node 9: Neighbors [2, 3, 4]

Let's count the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
7. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
8. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
9. Triangle <3, 6, 8>
10. Triangle <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
