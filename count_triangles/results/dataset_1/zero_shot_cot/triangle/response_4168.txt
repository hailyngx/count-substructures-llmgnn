Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each triplet of nodes and check if they form a triangle.
Let's list the triangles:

1. <0, 5, 9>
2. <2, 5, 8>
3. <3, 5, 9>
4. <4, 5, 6>
5. <3, 4, 7>
6. <0, 5, 2>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
