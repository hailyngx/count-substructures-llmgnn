Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's list all the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 5, 1>
3. <0, 7, 6>
4. <2, 4, 8>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <3, 4, 8>
7. <4, 6, 8>
8. <4, 6, 9>
9. <4, 8, 9>
10. <5, 1, 9>
11. <6, 7, 0>
12. <8, 9, 1>

There are 12 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
