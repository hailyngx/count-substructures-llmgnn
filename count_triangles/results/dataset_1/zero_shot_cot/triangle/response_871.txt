Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each vertex is part of and then dividing by 3 because each triangle is counted three times, once for each of its vertices. Let's find the triangles in this graph step-by-step:
    
Vertices connected to each other directly:  
Vertex 0: 8, 9  
Vertex 1: 5  
Vertex 2: 3, 7, 8  
Vertex 3: 2, 6, 7, 8  
Vertex 4: 5, 6, 7  
Vertex 5: 1, 4  
Vertex 6: 3, 4, 8  
Vertex 7: 2, 3, 4  
Vertex 8: 0, 2, 3, 6  
Vertex 9: 0  

Triangles formed by vertices connected to each other:
<2, 3, 7>  
<2, 3, 8>  
<2, 7, 8>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<3, 4, 6>  
<4, 6, 7>  
Total number of triangles: [ 6 ]
