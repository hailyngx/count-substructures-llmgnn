Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph.
To find the triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that all have edges connecting them to each other. Let's list all the triangles we can find:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 2: <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle 3: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 4: <3, 4, 5>
- Triangle 5: <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle 6: <4, 5, 9>
- Triangle 7: <5, 6, 8>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.
By listing out the unique triangles, we have found 7 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [7].
