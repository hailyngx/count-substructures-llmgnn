Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the connected nodes. A triangle is formed when there are three nodes connected in a closed loop.

Let's list the triangles first:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<8, 7, 9>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
