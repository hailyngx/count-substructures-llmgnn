Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the given information, the graph can be visualized as:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7)

To count the number of triangles, we need to find all possible triangles formed by the given graph. Let's list the unique triangles and count the total number of triangles at the end:

1. <1, 2, 6>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <1, 4, 6>
4. <1, 4, 9>
5. <1, 7, 9>
6. <2, 6, 9>
7. <3, 4, 9>
8. <6, 4, 9>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
