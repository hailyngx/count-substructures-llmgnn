Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given graph information:
- Number of nodes: 10
- Number of edges: 34

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list out the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <0, 4, 9>
5. <0, 6, 7>
6. <0, 6, 8>
7. <0, 7, 8>
8. <0, 7, 9>
9. <2, 3, 7>
10. <2, 4, 7>
11. <2, 4, 9>
12. <3, 4, 7>
13. <4, 6, 7>
14. <4, 6, 8>
15. <4, 7, 8>
16. <4, 7, 9>
17. <6, 7, 8>
18. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [18]
