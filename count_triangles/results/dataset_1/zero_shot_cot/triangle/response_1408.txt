Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the triangles in the graph. A triangle exists when three nodes are each connected to the other two. Let's list them step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {2, 4, 6, 7}
2. Nodes connected to node 1: {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
3. Nodes connected to node 2: {0, 1, 7}
4. Nodes connected to node 3: {1, 4, 5}
5. Nodes connected to node 4: {0, 3, 5, 9}
6. Nodes connected to node 5: {3, 4, 6, 8}
7. Nodes connected to node 6: {0, 1, 5}
8. Nodes connected to node 7: {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
9. Nodes connected to node 8: {1, 5, 7}
10. Nodes connected to node 9: {4, 7}

After checking the connections, the triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <1, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
