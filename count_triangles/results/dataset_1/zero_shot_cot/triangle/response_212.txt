Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Considering the given graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can calculate the number of triangles present.

<strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify triangles formed by each node:
- Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 7), (0, 2, 9), (0, 7, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 6), (1, 5, 6)
- Node 2: (2, 0, 7), (2, 0, 9), (2, 4, 7), (2, 7, 9), (2, 9, 0)
- Node 3: Not part of any triangle
- Node 4: (4, 2, 3)
- Node 5: (5, 1, 9)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 9), (6, 7, 9)
- Node 7: (7, 0, 2), (7, 0, 6), (7, 0, 9), (7, 2, 9), (7, 6, 9)
- Node 8: Not part of any triangle
- Node 9: (9, 0, 5), (9, 0, 6), (9, 0, 7), (9, 2, 5), (9, 2, 6), (9, 2, 7), (9, 5, 6), (9, 5, 7), (9, 6, 7), (9, 7, 8)

<strong>Step 2:</strong> Count the total number of triangles and list unique triangles:
- Total number of triangles: 17
- Unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 0, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, 
<4, 2, 3>, <5, 1, 9>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 0, 2>, <7, 0, 6>, <7, 0, 9>, <7, 2, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
