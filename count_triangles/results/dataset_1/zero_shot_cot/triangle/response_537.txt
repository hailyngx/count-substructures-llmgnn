Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to first identify all the triangles based on the provided edge list. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other forming a closed loop. Let's list down the triangles:

1. <0, 6, 8>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <0, 8, 2>
4. <0, 8, 6>
5. <0, 8, 9>
6. <0, 9, 5>
7. <1, 7, 2>
8. <5, 3, 7>
9. <5, 3, 9>
10. <5, 7, 6>
11. <6, 7, 8>
12. <7, 1, 2>
13. <7, 2, 5>
14. <7, 2, 8>
15. <7, 5, 6>
16. <7, 6, 8>
17. <8, 0, 6>
18. <8, 2, 6>
19. <8, 2, 7>
20. <8, 6, 7>
21. <9, 0, 5>
22. <9, 5, 0>

There are a total of [22] triangles in the given graph.
