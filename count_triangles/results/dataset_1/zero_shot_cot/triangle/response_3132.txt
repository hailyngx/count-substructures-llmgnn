Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to consider all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are interconnected.

Let's list out the triangles one by one:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
