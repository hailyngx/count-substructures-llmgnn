Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's analyze the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7.

Let's now calculate the total number of triangles: [16].

The unique triangles found in the graph are as follows:
<1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 1, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>.
