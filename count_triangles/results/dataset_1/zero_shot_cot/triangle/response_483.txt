Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
We can find the number of triangles in this graph by looking for all possible sets of three nodes that are mutually connected by edges. Let's list all the unique triangles first:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 9, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 8, 0>
<1, 7, 9>

Now let's count the total number of triangles in the graph: [7].
