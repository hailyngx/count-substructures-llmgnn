Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [10] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 2>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 8, 4>, <1, 9, 3>, <2, 8, 4>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 9, 0>, and <8, 9, 3>.
