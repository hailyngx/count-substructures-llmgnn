Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles one by one.

Triangles:
1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
