Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's enumerate the triangles present in this graph:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 9>

There are a total of 10 triangles in this graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in brackets is [10].
