Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can identify all possible triangles by examining each set of three nodes. A triangle is formed when there are edges between all three nodes in the set.

Let's determine the triangles by examining all possible combinations:

1. Triangle involving Node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 9), (0, 5, 9)
2. Triangle involving Node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 9), (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 9), (1, 5, 9)
3. Triangle involving Node 3: (3, 1, 5), (3, 1, 9), (3, 2, 1), (3, 2, 5), (3, 2, 9)
4. No triangles involving Node 2 or Node 4 as they are not connected to other nodes in triangles.
5. No triangles involving Node 5 as it does not form any new triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 2, 1>, <3, 2, 5>, <3, 2, 9>.
