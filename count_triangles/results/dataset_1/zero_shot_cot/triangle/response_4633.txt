Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each possible triangle formed by three nodes.

Given the edges provided, the possible triangles can be formed in the following ways:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 3, 4>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <2, 5, 7>
7. <2, 5, 8>
8. <2, 7, 8>
9. <3, 4, 8>
10. <4, 5, 7>
11. <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in total in this graph. So, the answer is [11].
