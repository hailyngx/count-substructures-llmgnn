Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by looking for closed loops of length 3. In this case, we will count the triangles using the given list of edges.

Let's denote the nodes as follows based on the given list of edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 8.

Now, we need to find the triangles. A triangle consists of three nodes connected to each other. Let's identify the unique triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
