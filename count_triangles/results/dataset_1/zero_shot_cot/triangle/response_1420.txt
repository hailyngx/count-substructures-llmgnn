Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each unique triangle formed by three connected nodes. Let's find all the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
3. Triangle <3, 4, 6>
4. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <6, 7, 2>
6. Triangle <8, 1, 9>

After listing all the unique triangles, we count a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
