Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's look for unique triangles among the nodes based on the given edges:

1. Possible triangles involving node 0: None
2. Possible triangles involving node 1: None
3. Possible triangles involving node 2: None
4. Possible triangles involving node 3: None
5. Possible triangles involving node 4: (0, 4, 7)
6. Possible triangles involving node 5: None
7. Possible triangles involving node 6: None
8. Possible triangles involving node 7: None
9. Possible triangles involving node 8: None
10. Possible triangles involving node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 4, 7>.
