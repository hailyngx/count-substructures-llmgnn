Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are each connected to each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
