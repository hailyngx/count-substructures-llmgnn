Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming triangles. Let's go step-by-step to find the total number of triangles in the graph:

1. For every node pair (i, j), check if there exists a node k such that there are edges (i, k) and (j, k).
2. Count the number of triangles formed by the node triplets (i, j, k).
3. List the unique triangles found.

Let's start by finding all the triangles in the graph:
- Triangles:
    - <0, 6, 9>
    - <2, 3, 6>
    - <2, 4, 6>
    - <3, 4, 6>
    - <4, 6, 8>
    - <6, 8, 9>

From the above list, we found 6 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [6].
