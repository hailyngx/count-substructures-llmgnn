Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's calculate the number of triangles step by step:

1. For each node, identify its neighbors:
   - Node 0: {5}
   - Node 1: {2, 4, 5}
   - Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 9}
   - Node 3: {2, 4, 7, 9}
   - Node 4: {1, 3}
   - Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
   - Node 7: {3, 5, 8}
   - Node 8: {5, 7}
   - Node 9: {2, 3, 5}

2. Count the triangles:
   - <1, 2, 5> is a triangle.
   - <2, 3, 9> is a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
