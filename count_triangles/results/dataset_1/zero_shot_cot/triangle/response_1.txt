Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step.

1. Node 0: Neighbors - 2, 4, 6
2. Node 1: Neighbors - 4, 5, 8
3. Node 2: Neighbors - 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
4. Node 3: Neighbors - 5, 7, 8
5. Node 4: Neighbors - 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
6. Node 5: Neighbors - 1, 2, 3, 4
7. Node 6: Neighbors - 0, 4, 8, 9
8. Node 7: Neighbors - 3, 4
9. Node 8: Neighbors - 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
10. Node 9: Neighbors - 2, 6

Now, let's find the triangles:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <5, 4, 1>

Total number of triangles: [9]
