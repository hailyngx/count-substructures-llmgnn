Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first look for sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <1, 5, 7>
4. <1, 5, 8>
5. <2, 3, 5>
6. <2, 4, 5>
7. <4, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [7]
