Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangles involving node 0:  
   - (0, 3, 7)
   
2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - (1, 5, 7)

3. Triangles involving node 3:
   - (0, 3, 7)
   - (3, 4, 8)

4. Triangles involving node 4:
   - (3, 4, 8)

5. Triangles involving node 5:
   - (1, 5, 7)

6. Triangles involving node 7:
   - (0, 3, 7)
   - (1, 5, 7)
   - (3, 7, 8)

7. Triangles involving node 8:
   - (3, 4, 8)
   - (1, 7, 8)

Now counting the unique triangles, we have:  
[6] (0, 3, 7), (1, 5, 7), (3, 4, 8), (3, 7, 8), (0, 3, 7), (1, 7, 8)
