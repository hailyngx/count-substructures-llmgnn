Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, and <6, 7, 9>.
