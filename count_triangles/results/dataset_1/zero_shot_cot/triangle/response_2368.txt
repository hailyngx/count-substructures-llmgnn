Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Here are the triangles present in the given graph:

1. <1, 3, 5>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <2, 3, 6>
5. <3, 5, 9>
6. <3, 7, 9>
7. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
