Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. <0, 7, 9>
2. <5, 7, 8>

So, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
