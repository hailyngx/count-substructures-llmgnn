Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze each possible triangle formed by three nodes connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
