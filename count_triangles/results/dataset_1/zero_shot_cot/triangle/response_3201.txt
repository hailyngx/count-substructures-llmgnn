Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, and 3: 
   - <0, 1, 2>
   - <0, 1, 3>
   - <0, 2, 3>
   
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with node 7:
   - <1, 7, 0>
   
3. Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 4 and 6:
   - <2, 4, 7>
   - <2, 6, 7>
   
4. Node 3 forms a triangle with node 9:
   - <3, 0, 9>
   
5. Node 4 forms a triangle with node 7:
   - <4, 7, 2>
   
6. Node 7 forms triangles with nodes 5, 6, and 8:
   - <7, 5, 4>
   - <7, 6, 2>
   - <7, 8, 1>
   
7. Node 8 forms a triangle with node 9:
   - <8, 9, 2>

Now, counting the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = 9

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
