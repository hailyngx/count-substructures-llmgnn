Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the graph using the given edges:
1. (1, 3, 7)
2. (3, 5, 8)
3. (3, 7, 8)
4. (7, 4, 1)
5. (8, 5, 3)
6. (8, 9, 2)
7. (9, 2, 8)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [7]
