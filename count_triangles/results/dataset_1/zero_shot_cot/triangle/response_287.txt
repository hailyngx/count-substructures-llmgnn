Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's first list down all the triangles we can find in this graph:

1. <0, 6, 5>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <1, 5, 4>
4. <1, 5, 6>
5. <1, 5, 7>
6. <4, 5, 6>
7. <6, 7, 1>
8. <6, 7, 8>

There are 8 unique triangles in total. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
