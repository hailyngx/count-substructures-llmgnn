Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to check each possible set of three nodes to see if they form a triangle. A triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Given the edges in the graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
