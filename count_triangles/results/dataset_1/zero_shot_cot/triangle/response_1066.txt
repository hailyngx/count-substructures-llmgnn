Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to Node 2: (0, 2)
2. Node 1 is connected to Node 5, 6: (1, 5), (1, 6)
3. Node 2 is connected to Node 0: (2, 0)
4. Node 4 is connected to Node 5, 6, 7, 9: (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9)
5. Node 5 is connected to Node 1, 4: (5, 1), (5, 4)
6. Node 6 is connected to Node 1, 4, 7, 9: (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9)
7. Node 7 is connected to Node 4, 6, 8, 9: (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9)
8. Node 8 is connected to Node 7: (8, 7)
9. Node 9 is connected to Node 4, 6, 7: (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle formed by nodes 4, 5, 6: <4, 5, 6>
2. Triangle formed by nodes 4, 6, 7: <4, 6, 7>
3. Triangle formed by nodes 6, 7, 9: <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
