Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 9: <0, 3, 9>
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 8: <1, 6, 8>
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 7: <2, 5, 7>
4. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 9: <2, 7, 9>
5. Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 7: <3, 6, 7>
6. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 8: <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
