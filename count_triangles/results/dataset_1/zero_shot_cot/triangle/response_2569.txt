Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 5.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Triangles:
1. <0, 5, 9>
2. <0, 6, 5>
3. <0, 7, 5>
4. <5, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
