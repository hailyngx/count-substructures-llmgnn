Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <2, 6, 7>
5. <2, 3, 8>
6. <7, 8, 9>

Counting the unique triangles found: [6]
