Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's list out all the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 3, 4>
4. <0, 3, 8>
5. <0, 3, 9>
6. <0, 4, 9>
7. <1, 3, 4>
8. <4, 5, 9>
9. <5, 7, 9>
10. <3, 6, 4>
11. <5, 8, 9>

There are a total of 11 unique triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
