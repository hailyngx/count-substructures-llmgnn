Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>.
