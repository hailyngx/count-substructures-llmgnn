Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in a graph, we look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's find the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangles involving node 0: None
2. Triangles involving node 1: None
3. Triangles involving node 2: None
4. Triangles involving node 3: (0, 2, 3)
5. Triangles involving node 4: (0, 3, 4) and (3, 5, 4)
6. Triangles involving node 5: None
7. Triangles involving node 6: (2, 3, 6) and (3, 4, 6)
8. Triangles involving node 7: None
9. Triangles involving node 8: None
10. Triangles involving node 9: (3, 5, 9) and (3, 6, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **6**, and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <3, 5, 4>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, and <3, 5, 9>.
