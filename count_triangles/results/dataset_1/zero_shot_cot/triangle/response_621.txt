Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 8, 9.
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7.
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1.
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 5.
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 3, 7.
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 9.
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 7, 9.
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 9.
9. Node 8: Connected to node 0.
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7.

Using the given edges, we can identify the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 1>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <1, 3, 5>
5. <1, 3, 7>
6. <1, 5, 9>
7. <3, 5, 9>
8. <7, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
