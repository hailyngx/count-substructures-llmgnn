Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, the unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
