Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected to each other. Here's the step-by-step approach to find the total number of triangles:

1. Identify the triangles by looking for nodes that form closed loops of length 3.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

From the given edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 3, 7>
3. <3, 6, 7>

Counting the above unique triangles, we find that there are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
