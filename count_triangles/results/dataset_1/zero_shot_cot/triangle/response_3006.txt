Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique combinations of three nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected with edges to each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <2, 8, 9>
4. <3, 6, 7>
5. <3, 8, 9>
6. <4, 5, 7>
7. <5, 6, 7>
8. <6, 7, 9>
9. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
