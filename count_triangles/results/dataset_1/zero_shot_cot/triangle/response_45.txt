Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every possible triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles formed in the graph:

1. <0, 7, 9>
2. <1, 5, 6>
3. <1, 5, 7>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <1, 9, 8>
6. <2, 4, 8>
7. <4, 7, 5>
8. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. So, the output is [8].
