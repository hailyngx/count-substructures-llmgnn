Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We can calculate the number of triangles in the graph by looking for loops of length 3. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find all the unique triangles:

1. Starting from node 0, we check all the neighbors of node 0 which are 1 and 6. Since there is an edge between 1 and 6, there is a triangle <0, 1, 6>.

2. Next, moving to node 1, we check its neighbors 0, 4, and 9. There is an edge between 0 and 4, forming a triangle <0, 1, 4>.

3. Moving to node 2, the only neighbor it has is node 3.

4. Node 3 has neighbors 2, 6, and 9. However, there is no edge between these neighbors, so no triangles are formed using node 3.

5. Moving to node 4, we find the neighbors 1, 5, 6, and 8. The edge between 1 and 5 forms a triangle <1, 4, 5>.

6. Node 5 has edges with 4, 7, and 8, but no new triangles are formed.

7. Node 6 has neighbors 0, 3, 4, and 8. The edge between 0 and 3 forms a triangle <0, 6, 3>.

8. Node 7 has neighbors 5 and 9, but no new triangles are formed.

9. Node 8 has neighbors 4, 5, 6, and 9. The edge between 4 and 5 forms a triangle <4, 8, 5>. The edge between 6 and 8 also forms a triangle <6, 8, 4>.

10. Finally, node 9 has neighbors 1, 3, 7, and 8. The edge between 1 and 3 forms a triangle <1, 9, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
