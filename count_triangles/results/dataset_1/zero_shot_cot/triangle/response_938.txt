Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. One way to approach this is to look for nodes that have two edges connecting them and check if there is a third edge completing the triangle.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <0, 3, 8>
4. <1, 2, 3>
5. <2, 3, 8>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
