Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles:
1. <1, 4, 5>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <3, 4, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles in the given graph:
