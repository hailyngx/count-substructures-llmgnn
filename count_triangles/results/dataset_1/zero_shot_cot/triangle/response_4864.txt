Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [1]. Here is the unique triangle found: <0, 4, 8>.
