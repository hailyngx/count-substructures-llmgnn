Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of closed loops of length 3, also known as triangles.

Let's list the triangles present in this graph:

<3, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<8, 9, 7>

Counting the triangles results in a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
