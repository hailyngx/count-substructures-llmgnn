Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 11 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 1>
<6, 9, 7>
<7, 9, 0>
<8, 0, 4>
<9, 6, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
