Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will enumerate all possible triangles without repetitions to find the total count. Let's begin:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 3, 4>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 5, 8>
4. Triangle 4: <1, 7, 9>
5. Triangle 5: <2, 4, 9>
6. Triangle 6: <3, 4, 6>
7. Triangle 7: <3, 5, 9>
8. Triangle 8: <4, 5, 9>
9. Triangle 9: <5, 6, 9>
10. Triangle 10: <1, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
