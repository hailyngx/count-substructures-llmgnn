Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 6, 1>
2. Triangle <0, 6, 3>
3. Triangle <0, 7, 1>
4. Triangle <0, 7, 4>
5. Triangle <0, 8, 1>
6. Triangle <1, 6, 3>
7. Triangle <1, 7, 4>
8. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
9. Triangle <6, 1, 3>
10. Triangle <7, 0, 1>
11. Triangle <8, 0, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
