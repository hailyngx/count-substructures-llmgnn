Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle in the graph and count them.

The possible triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 2, 5>
4. <0, 4, 6>
5. <6, 7, 8>
6. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [6]
