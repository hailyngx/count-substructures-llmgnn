Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a matrix representation of the graph to visualize the connections:

```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
0   0  0  0  1  0  0  1  1  1  1
1   0  0  0  1  0  0  0  1  0  1
2   0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  1  1
3   1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0
4   0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
5   0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
6   1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1
7   1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1
8   1  0  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  1
9   1  1  1  0  0  0  1  1  1
