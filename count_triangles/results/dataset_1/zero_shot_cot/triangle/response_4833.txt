Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the edges given. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Since counting all triangles with the given edges directly might be cumbersome, let's first identify the unique triangles in the graph and then count them:

1. <2, 4, 7>
2. <3, 5, 7>
3. <5, 7, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph by listing the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [3]
