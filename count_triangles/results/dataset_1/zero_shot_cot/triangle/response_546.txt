Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By examining the edges provided, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 6>

So, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
