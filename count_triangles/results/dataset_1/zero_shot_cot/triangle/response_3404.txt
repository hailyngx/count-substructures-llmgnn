Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the connected nodes. 

Let's list the triangles that can be formed:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 2, 5>
4. <0, 2, 7>
5. <1, 3, 5>
6. <1, 4, 6>
7. <1, 4, 7>
8. <2, 5, 3>
9. <2, 6, 4>
10. <2, 7, 0>
11. <2, 7, 3>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
