Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in a graph, we need to identify each combination of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles first and then count them.

The triangles in the given graph are:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
