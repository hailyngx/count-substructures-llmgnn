Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each triplet of nodes and see if they form a triangle by having edges between each pair of nodes in the triplet. Let's determine the number of triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 4>
6. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
8. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
9. Triangle <4, 8, 9>
10. Triangle <5, 8, 9>
11. Triangle <6, 7, 9>
12. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
