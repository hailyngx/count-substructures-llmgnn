Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Identify any triangles:
   - Nodes 0, 2, and 7 form a triangle.
   - Nodes 0, 2, and 8 form a triangle.
   - Nodes 0, 2, and 9 form a triangle.
   - Nodes 0, 7, and 9 form a triangle.
   - Nodes 2, 7, and 9 form a triangle.
   - Nodes 1, 2, and 4 form a triangle.
   - Nodes 3, 6, and 8 form a triangle.
   - Nodes 4, 7, and 9 form a triangle.

2. Count the total number of triangles and list them as unique sets:
   - Total number of triangles: [8]
   - Unique triangles: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 9>
