Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we have to look for sets of three nodes that are all pairwise connected. 

Let's identify the possible triangles step-by-step:
1. Triangle formed by nodes (0, 4, 5): <0, 4, 5>
2. Triangle formed by nodes (2, 5, 9): <2, 5, 9>
3. Triangle formed by nodes (3, 5, 8): <3, 5, 8>

Count of triangles: [3]
