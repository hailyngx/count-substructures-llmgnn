Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for combinations of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's identify the triangles in the graph by looking at each possible combination of three nodes:

1. Triangles involving node 1:
   - (1, 5, 8)
   - <1, 5, 7>
   - <1, 7, 3>
   - <1, 5, 8>

2. Triangles involving node 3:
   - None

3. Triangles involving node 4:
   - None

4. Triangles involving node 5:
   - None

5. Triangles involving node 6:
   - None

6. Triangles involving node 7:
   - None

7. Triangles involving node 8:
   - (1, 5, 8)

8. Triangles involving node 9:
   - None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
