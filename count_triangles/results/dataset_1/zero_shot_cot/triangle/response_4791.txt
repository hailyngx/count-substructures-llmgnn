Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles first:
1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <1, 5, 8>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <4, 6, 7>
7. <4, 7, 8>
8. <4, 8, 5>
9. <7, 6, 4>
10. <7, 4, 8>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. Hence, the total number of triangles is [10].
