Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes.

The triangles in this graph are as follows:
1. <3, 0, 8>
2. <3, 1, 6>
3. <3, 6, 8>
4. <6, 4, 9>
5. <6, 5, 9>
6. <7, 2, 8>
7. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
