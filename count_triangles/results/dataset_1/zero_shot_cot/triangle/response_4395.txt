Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each unique triangle formed by three connected nodes. Let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <1, 5, 9>
5. <2, 6, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
