Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique triangles formed by connecting three vertices.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <3, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
