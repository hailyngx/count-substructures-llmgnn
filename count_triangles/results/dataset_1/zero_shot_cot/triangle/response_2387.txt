Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique sets of 3 nodes that are all interconnected. Let's start by listing the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <0, 6, 9>
5. <0, 8, 9>
6. <1, 4, 8>
7. <4, 5, 6>
8. <5, 7, 8>
9. <8, 9, 4>
10. <0, 1, 8>
11. <0, 5, 4>
12. <0, 6, 4>
13. <0, 8, 5>
14. <0, 9, 6>
15. <0, 9, 8>
16. <1, 8, 4>
17. <4, 6, 5>
18. <5, 8, 7>
19. <8, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [19] triangles in the given graph.
