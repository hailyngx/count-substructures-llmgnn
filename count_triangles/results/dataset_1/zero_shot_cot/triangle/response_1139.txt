Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in a graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Given the edges:
(1, 7), (2, 6), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 4), (6, 2), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 4), (8, 6)

We can identify the possible triangles:
- Triangle 1: (1, 7), (1, 7), (7, 1) => <1, 7>
- Triangle 2: (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 4) => <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle 3: (2, 6), (2, 6), (6, 2) => <2, 6>
- Triangle 4: (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 4) => <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle 5: (6, 8), (6, 8), (8, 6) => <6, 8>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. So, the output will be:
[5]
