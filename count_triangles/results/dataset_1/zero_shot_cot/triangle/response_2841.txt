Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a triangle. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to Node 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to Node 3, 5, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to Node 4, 5, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to Node 1, 4, and 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to Node 2, 3, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to Node 1, 2, and 3.
7. Node 6 is connected to Node 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to Node 1 and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to Node 1 and 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to Node 0 and 2.

Now, let's list down the unique triangles:

1. <1, 3, 5>
2. <1, 4, 8>
3. <1, 5, 2>
4. <1, 7, 6>
5. <2, 4, 3>
6. <2, 5, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
