Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, and <5, 6, 8>.
