Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are interconnected.

Let's list out the triangles found in this graph:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<8, 7, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph: [10]
