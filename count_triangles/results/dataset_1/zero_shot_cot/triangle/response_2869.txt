Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for closed loops of length 3 (triangles). Let's analyze the graph step-by-step.

1. Starting from node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 8. By connecting nodes 0, 1, and 8, we get the triangle <0, 1, 8>.
   
2. Moving on to other nodes:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9. There are no triangles formed with these connections.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8. No triangles are formed with these connections.
   - Node 4 is connected to node 2, forming no triangles.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9, without forming any triangles.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5, resulting in no triangles.
   - Node 7 is connected to node 9, creating no triangles.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3, completing the triangle <0, 1, 8>.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7, with no triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2, and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8> and <0, 1, 8>. Hence, the answer is [2].
