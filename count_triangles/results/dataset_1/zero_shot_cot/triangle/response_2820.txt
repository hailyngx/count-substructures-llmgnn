Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges given. Here are the unique triangles:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <1, 4, 5>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <2, 3, 9>
7. <5, 7, 8>
8. <8, 9, 2>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
