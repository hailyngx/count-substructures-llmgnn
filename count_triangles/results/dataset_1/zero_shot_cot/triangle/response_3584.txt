Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <0, 2, 1>
3. <1, 2, 5>
4. <2, 5, 3>
5. <4, 6, 8>
6. <5, 3, 6>
7. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
