Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

0. **Node 0:** Neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8
    - <0, 1, 5>
    - <0, 1, 6>
    - <0, 5, 6>
    - No new triangles found.

1. **Node 1:** Neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 8
    - <1, 0, 5> (already counted)
    - No new triangles found.

2. **Node 2:** Neighbors: 3, 7, 9
    - No triangles involving node 2.

3. **Node 3:** Neighbors: 1, 2, 6
    - No triangles involving node 3.

4. **Node 4:** Neighbors: 8, 9
    - No triangles involving node 4.

5. **Node 5:** Neighbors: 0, 1, 6
    - <5, 0, 1> (already counted)
    - No new triangles found.

6. **Node 6:** Neighbors: 0, 3, 5
    - <6, 0, 5>
    - No new triangles found.

7. **Node 7:** Neighbors: 0, 2, 8
    - No triangles involving node 7.

8. **Node 8:** Neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7
    - <8, 0, 1> (already counted)
    - No new triangles found.

9. **Node 9:** Neighbors: 2, 4
    - No triangles involving node 9.

Total number of triangles: [4]
