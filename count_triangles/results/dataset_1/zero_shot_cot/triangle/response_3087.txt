Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle by having edges between all three nodes.

Let's list down the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <1, 2, 5>
6. <1, 4, 5>
7. <1, 5, 9>
8. <2, 3, 5>
9. <2, 4, 5>
10. <3, 5, 9>
11. <4, 5, 9>
12. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
