Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can calculate the total number of triangles by examining each node pair that shares a common neighbor. A triangle consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two. Let's go through the nodes step by step:

1. For node 1 (neighbors: 4, 7): No triangles can be formed with node 1.
2. For node 2 (neighbors: 5, 8): No triangles can be formed with node 2.
3. For node 3 (neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 9):
   - Triangle with nodes 5, 6, 3 <3, 5, 6>.
   - Triangle with nodes 5, 7, 3 <3, 5, 7>.
   - Triangle with nodes 5, 9, 3 <3, 5, 9>.
   
4. For node 4 (neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 8):
   - Triangle with nodes 1, 5, 4 <1, 4, 5>.
   - Triangle with nodes 1, 7, 4 <1, 4, 7>.
   - Triangle with nodes 5, 7, 4 <4, 5, 7>.
   - Triangle with nodes 5, 8, 4 <4, 5, 8>.

5. For node 5 (neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9): No additional triangles can be formed with node 5.
6. For node 6 (neighbors: 3): No triangles can be formed with node 6.
7. For node 7 (neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5): No additional triangles can be formed with node 7.
8. For node 8 (neighbors: 2, 4, 5): No additional triangles can be formed with node 8.
9. For node 9 (neighbors: 3, 5): No triangles can be formed with node 9.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6] and the unique triangles found are <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>.
