Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will identify the triangles in the graph by looking for cycles of length 3. Let's go step by step:

1. For node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 4)
2. For node 1: (1, 0, 2)
3. For node 2: (2, 0, 4), (2, 1, 6)
4. For node 4: (4, 0, 2), (4, 2, 6)
5. For node 5: No triangles.
6. For node 6: (6, 1, 5), (6, 1, 0), (6, 1, 2), (6, 1, 9), (6, 2, 0), (6, 2, 4), (6, 2, 9), (6, 4, 0), (6, 4, 2), (6, 5, 8), (6, 8, 5)
7. For node 7: No triangles.
8. For node 8: No triangles.
9. For node 9: No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12] and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 0, 2>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 1, 6>, <4, 0, 2>, <4, 2, 6>, <6, 1, 5>, <6, 1, 0>, <6, 1, 2>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 2, 0>.
