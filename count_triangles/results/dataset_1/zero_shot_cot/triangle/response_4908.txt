Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Let's write down all the triangles that can be formed using the given edges:
- Triangle 1: (0, 4, 6)
- Triangle 2: (0, 4, 1)
- Triangle 3: (0, 4, 5)
- Triangle 4: (0, 6, 1)
- Triangle 5: (1, 4, 5)
- Triangle 6: (1, 6, 7)
- Triangle 7: (1, 6, 4)
- Triangle 8: (1, 4, 8)
- Triangle 9: (1, 4, 8)
- Triangle 10: (1, 8, 2)
- Triangle 11: (4, 8, 2)
- Triangle 12: (4, 8, 9)
- Triangle 13: (6, 7, 1)
- Triangle 14: (6, 4, 8)
- Triangle 15: (0, 9, 8)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles:
Total triangles = 15

The total number of triangles in the graph is [15]. 

Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 1>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 8, 2>, <4, 8, 2>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 1>, <6, 4, 8>, <0, 9, 8>.
