Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We can find the triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected in a way that forms a triangle.

Let's list the triangles found in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 3, 4>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
6. Triangle <4, 6, 8>
7. Triangle <7, 1, 9>
8. Triangle <8, 0, 9>
9. Triangle <8, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in total. So, the answer is [9].
