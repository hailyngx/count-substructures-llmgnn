Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Nodes connected to Node 0: {2, 5}
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5>
   
2. Nodes connected to Node 1: {2, 7}
   - No triangle here.

3. Nodes connected to Node 2: {0, 1, 3}
   - No triangle here.

4. Nodes connected to Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 7}
   - No triangle here.

5. Nodes connected to Node 4: {5, 7}
   - No triangle here.

6. Nodes connected to Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 6}
   - No triangle here.

7. Nodes connected to Node 6: {3, 5, 8}
   - No triangle here.

8. Nodes connected to Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 9}
   - No triangle here.

9. Nodes connected to Node 8: {6}
   - No triangle here.

10. Nodes connected to Node 9: {7}
   - No triangle here.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1]. The only triangle found is <0, 2, 5>.
