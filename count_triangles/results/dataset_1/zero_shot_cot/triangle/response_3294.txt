Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. For Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
   - Among these neighbors, we can form triangles with (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 6). So, we have <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, and <0, 1, 6>.

2. For Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
   - Among these neighbors, we can form triangles with (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (2, 4), and (4, 5). So, we have <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 6>, <1, 2, 4>, and <1, 4, 5>.

3. For Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
   - Among these neighbors, we can form a triangle with (0, 1). So, we have <0, 1, 2>.

4. For Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.
   - Among these neighbors, we can form triangles with (0, 6). So, we have <0, 3, 6>.

5. For Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 6.
   - Among these neighbors, we can form a triangle with (1, 5). So, we have <1, 4, 5>.

Now, let's count the total number of triangles from the unique triangles found:
- Total number of triangles: [5]
