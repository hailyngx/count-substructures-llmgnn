Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
From the given graph, we can count the number of triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 4>
4. Triangle <3, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <8, 3, 5>
6. Triangle <8, 4, 5>

Count of triangles = [6]
