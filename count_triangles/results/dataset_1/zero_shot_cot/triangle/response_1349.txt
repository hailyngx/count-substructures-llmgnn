Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles in this graph using the provided edges:

1. Identify the triangles by checking all possible combinations of nodes connected by edges.
2. List down the unique triangles found.
3. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Based on the provided edges, we can find the following triangles:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <1, 3, 5>
4. <1, 3, 6>
5. <1, 4, 9>
6. <2, 4, 7>
7. <2, 4, 9>
8. <3, 6, 8>
9. <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
