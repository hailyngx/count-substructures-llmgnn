Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's start by listing the triangles found in this graph:

1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <2, 3, 7>
5. <3, 6, 9>
6. <3, 7, 9>
7. <6, 7, 9>
8. <7, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
