Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>.
