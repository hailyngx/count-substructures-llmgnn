Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 3. The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, and <6, 8, 9>.
