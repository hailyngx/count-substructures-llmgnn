Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's identify the triangles present in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 3 is connected to nodes 1, forming a triangle <0, 3, 1>.
2. Nodes 4, 5, and 9 form a triangle <4, 5, 9>.
3. Nodes 5, 6, and 8 form a triangle <5, 6, 8>.
4. Nodes 6, 7, and 1 form a triangle <6, 7, 1>.
5. Nodes 6, 7, and 8 form a triangle <6, 7, 8>.

Hence, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
