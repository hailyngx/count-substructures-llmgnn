Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected by edges.

First, let's list out all the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <0, 8, 4>
5. <0, 8, 9>
6. <1, 4, 6>
7. <4, 5, 9>
8. <4, 6, 7>
9. <4, 8, 9>
10. <6, 7, 0>
11. <8, 9, 5>

There are 11 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
