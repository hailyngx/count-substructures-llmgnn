Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 8.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
4. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8.
6. Node 3 is connected to node 5.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
