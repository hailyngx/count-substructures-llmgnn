Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles are <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <8, 4, 9>, and <8, 9, 5>.
