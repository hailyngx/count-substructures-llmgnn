Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are pairwise connected. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 8, forming a triangle <0, 8, 8>. [1 triangle]
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 4, forming two triangles <1, 3, 4>. [2 triangles]
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9, forming a triangle <2, 5, 9>. [3 triangles]
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9, forming a triangle <1, 3, 7> and <1, 3, 9>. [5 triangles]
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 8, forming no triangles (since node 4 is not directly connected to node 8).
6. Node 5 is connected to node 2, forming no triangles.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9, forming a triangle <2, 3, 9>. [6 triangles]
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9, forming a triangle <0, 8, 9>. [7 triangles]
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8, forming a triangle <2, 9, 8>. [8 triangles]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
