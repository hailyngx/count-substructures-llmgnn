Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's find the triangles step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 2> is found.
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5> is found.
   - Triangle <0, 8, 9> is found.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
   - No new triangles are found.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 8.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 2> is already counted.
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5> is already counted.
   - Triangle <0, 2, 8> is found.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
   - No new triangles are found.

5. Node 4 is connected to node 3 and 5.
   - No new triangles are found.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7.
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5> is already counted.
   - Triangle <0, 2, 8> is already counted.
   - Triangle <0, 5, 4> is found.
   - Triangle <2, 5, 6> is found.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9.
   - No new triangles are found.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
   - No new triangles are found.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 6.
   - Triangle <0, 2, 8> is already counted.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6.
   - No new triangles are found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4] as listed in brackets. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 8, 9>, and <0, 5, 4>.
