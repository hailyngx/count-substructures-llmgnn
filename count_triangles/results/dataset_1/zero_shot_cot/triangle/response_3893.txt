Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 1.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7.

Now, let's list the unique triangles:
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <8, 5, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
