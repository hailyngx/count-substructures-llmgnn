Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in a cyclic manner.

Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
