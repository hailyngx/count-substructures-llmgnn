Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph:

To form a triangle, we need to find three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the graph:

Nodes 0, 6, 7 form a triangle.
Nodes 0, 6, 8 form a triangle.
Nodes 0, 7, 8 form a triangle.
Nodes 1, 5, 8 form a triangle.
Nodes 2, 6, 8 form a triangle.
Nodes 4, 6, 9 form a triangle.
Nodes 6, 8, 5 form a triangle.

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, and <4, 6, 9>.
