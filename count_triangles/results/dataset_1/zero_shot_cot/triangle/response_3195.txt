Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 2, 9)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 3, 9)
3. Triangle 3: (2, 3, 9)
4. Triangle 4: (3, 6, 9)
5. Triangle 5: (2, 8, 9)

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
