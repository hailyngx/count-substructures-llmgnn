Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 6, 9
   - Triangle <0, 4, 6>
   - Triangle <0, 4, 9>
   - Triangle <0, 6, 9>

2. Node 1: Connected to node 3 (no triangles)

3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 5
   - Triangle <2, 3, 4>
   - Triangle <2, 3, 5>
   - Triangle <2, 4, 5>

4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 8
   - Triangle <1, 2, 3>
   - Triangle <2, 3, 6>
   - Triangle <2, 3, 8>

5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 7
   - Triangle <0, 2, 4>
   - Triangle <0, 4, 7>
   - Triangle <2, 4, 7>

6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 7, 9
   - Triangle <2, 5, 7>
   - Triangle <5, 7, 9>

7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 8
   - Triangle <0, 3, 6>
   - Triangle <3, 6, 8>

8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 5
   - Triangle <4, 5, 7>

9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 3, 6
   - Triangle <3, 6, 8>

10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 5
   - Triangle <0, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
