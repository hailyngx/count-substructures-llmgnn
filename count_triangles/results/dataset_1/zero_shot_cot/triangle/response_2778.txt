Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to determine the total number of triangles.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 7.

Next, let's list down the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <2, 5, 7>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
