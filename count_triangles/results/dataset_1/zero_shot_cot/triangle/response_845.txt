Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's analyze the graph and find the triangles:

1. Triangle 1: (1, 2, 5)

2. Triangle 2: (1, 3, 4)

3. Triangle 3: (1, 5, 7)

4. Triangle 4: (1, 5, 9)

5. Triangle 5: (2, 5, 7)

6. Triangle 6: (3, 4, 5)

7. Triangle 7: (5, 7, 9)

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are: <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <5, 7, 9>.
