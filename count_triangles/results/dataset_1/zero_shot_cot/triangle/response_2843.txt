Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <5, 6, 1>

[Total number of triangles: [4]]
