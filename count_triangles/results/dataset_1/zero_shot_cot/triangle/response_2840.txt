Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 6, 4>
3. Triangle <1, 0, 6>
4. Triangle <1, 7, 4>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
6. Triangle <3, 7, 4>

Counting the total number of triangles: [6]
