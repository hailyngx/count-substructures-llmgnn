Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a matrix form to make it easier to identify triangles. We will use 1 to indicate an edge between two nodes and 0 for no edge.

Matrix representation of the graph:
```
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
```

Now, let's count the number of triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 8, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 6, 8>
8. Triangle <4, 6, 9>
9. Triangle <4, 8, 9>
10. Triangle <6, 7, 9>
11. Triangle <8, 9, 7>

Total number of triangles: [11]
