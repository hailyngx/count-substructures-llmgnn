Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's examine each possible triangle:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>: (0, 1), (1, 4), and (0, 4) are present.
2. Triangle <0, 1, 5>: (0, 1), (1, 5), and (0, 5) are present.
3. Triangle <0, 4, 5>: (0, 4), (4, 5), and (0, 5) are present.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
