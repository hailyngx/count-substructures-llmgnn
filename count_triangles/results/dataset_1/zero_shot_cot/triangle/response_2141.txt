Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can check for each possible triangle involving three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other forming a closed loop. Let's identify the triangles present in the graph:

1. Nodes (1, 3, 5) form a triangle.
2. Nodes (1, 4, 8) form a triangle.
3. Nodes (1, 5, 9) form a triangle.
4. Nodes (2, 7, 9) form a triangle.
5. Nodes (3, 5, 9) form a triangle.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, and <3, 5, 9>.
