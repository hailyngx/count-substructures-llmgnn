Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles formed by the given edges.
    
    - For a triangle to exist, all three nodes must be interconnected. Let's list down all the triangles:
    
    Triangles:
    <0, 3, 7>
    <0, 6, 9>
    <1, 2, 5>
    <1, 5, 6>
    <3, 4, 5>
    <3, 6, 7>
    <3, 7, 9>
    <4, 5, 6>
    <5, 6, 7>
    
Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles.

    Total number of triangles: [9]
