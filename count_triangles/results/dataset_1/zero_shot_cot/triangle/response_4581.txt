Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, and <4, 6, 8>.
