Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify sets of three vertices that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Look for all possible triangles by checking each group of three vertices to see if they form a triangle. We will not repeat triangles (i.e., permutations and combinations will not apply).

2. Possible Triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (1, 5, 9)
   - Triangle 2: (2, 3, 9)
   - Triangle 3: (3, 4, 6)
   - Triangle 4: (3, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 5: (4, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 6: (1, 5, 9)

3. Count of Unique Triangles: 5

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
