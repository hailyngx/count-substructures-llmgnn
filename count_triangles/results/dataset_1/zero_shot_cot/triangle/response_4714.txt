Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 20 unique triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles are: 
<1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 9, 3>, <1, 9, 4>, 
<2, 6, 5>, <3, 1, 9>, <3, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, 
<3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 9, 4>, <3, 9, 5>, 
<5, 6, 2>, <5, 8, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [20].
