Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. There are two steps to do this:

Step 1: Identify triangles using the given edges:
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 6>

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles:
- Total number of triangles: [3]
