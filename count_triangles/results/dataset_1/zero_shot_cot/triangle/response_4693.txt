Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique combinations of nodes that form triangles. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles in the graph:
   - Triangles are formed by 3 nodes connected in a closed loop.
   - Each triangle should have 3 edges.

2. Consider each possible combination of 3 nodes and check if they form a triangle.

By examining the edges, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 2, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
