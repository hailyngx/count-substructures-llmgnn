Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices can be listed as follows:
0: {4, 5, 8}
1: {4, 9}
2: {3, 5, 7}
3: {2, 4, 5, 9}
4: {0, 1, 3, 5}
5: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}
6: {8}
7: {2, 8}
8: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
9: {1, 3, 8}

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles = 0

List of unique triangles:
[<0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <8, 5, 0>, <8, 5, 2>, <8, 5, 3>, <8, 9, 1>, <8, 9, 3>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
