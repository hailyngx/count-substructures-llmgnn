Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can follow these steps:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.

Now let's count the triangles by examining each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes:

1. Triangles involving Node 0: None
2. Triangles involving Node 1: None
3. Triangles involving Node 2: None
4. Triangles involving Node 3: None
5. Triangles involving Node 4: None
6. Triangles involving Node 5: None
7. Triangles involving Node 6: None
8. Triangles involving Node 7: None
9. Triangles involving Node 8: None
10. Triangles involving Node 9: (0, 1, 9)

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, which is: <0, 1, 9>. The total number of triangles is [1].
