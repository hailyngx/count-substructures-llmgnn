Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down all the triangles present in the given graph:

1. <2, 4, 6>
2. <4, 5, 7>
3. <6, 8, 9>

There are a total of 3 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the output is [3].
