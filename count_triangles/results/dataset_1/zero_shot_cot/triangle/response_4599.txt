Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for unique combinations of nodes that form triangles.

1. First, let's list the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <2, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 2: 

2. Now, let's count the total number of triangles, which is 1. Therefore, the answer is [1].
