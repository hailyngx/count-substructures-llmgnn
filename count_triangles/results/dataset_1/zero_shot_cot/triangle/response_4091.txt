Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0: No triangles include node 0.
2. Node 1: Possible triangles with node 1 are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, and <2, 1, 3>.
3. Node 2: No triangles include node 2.
4. Node 3: No triangles include node 3.
5. Node 4: No triangles include node 4.
6. Node 5: No triangles include node 5.
7. Node 6: No triangles include node 6.
8. Node 7: No triangles include node 7.
9. Node 8: No triangles include node 8.
10. Node 9: No triangles include node 9.

Total number of triangles: [3]
