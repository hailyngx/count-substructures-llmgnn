Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangles involving node 0: <0, 4, 5> and <0, 5, 9>.
- Triangles involving node 1: No new triangles.
- Triangles involving node 2: No new triangles.
- Triangles involving node 3: No new triangles.
- Triangles involving node 4: <0, 4, 5>.
- Triangles involving node 5: <0, 4, 5>.
- Triangles involving node 6: No new triangles.
- Triangles involving node 7: No new triangles.
- Triangles involving node 8: No new triangles.
- Triangles involving node 9: No new triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5> and <0, 5, 9>.
