Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Starting from the first node 0, we see its neighbors are nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9. Checking for triangles:
- Nodes 0, 5, 7 form a triangle <0, 5, 7>.
- Nodes 0, 5, 8 form a triangle <0, 5, 8>.
- Nodes 0, 7, 8 form a triangle <0, 7, 8>.
- Nodes 0, 7, 9 form a triangle <0, 7, 9>.

Moving to the second node 1:
- Nodes 1, 5, 7 form a triangle <1, 5, 7>.
- Nodes 1, 5, 9 form a triangle <1, 5, 9>.

Continuing this process, we find the following additional triangles:
-  <2, 3, 4>
-  <3, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
