Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph. A triangle exists when there are three nodes connected to each other. We can count them manually by examining each group of three nodes to see if they are all connected. 

All possible triangles in the graph are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 2>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 2>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 3>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 4, 2>, <5, 4, 6>, <6, 8, 7>, <8, 9, 7>, <8, 9, 4>, <8, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [24].
