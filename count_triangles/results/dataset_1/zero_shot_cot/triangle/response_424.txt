Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each set of three nodes that form a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected with edges between all three of them.

Let's list all the triangles that can be formed in this graph:

1. <0, 5, 4>
2. <0, 5, 1>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <1, 3, 4>
5. <1, 4, 7>
6. <3, 4, 7>
7. <4, 2, 5>
8. <7, 9, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
