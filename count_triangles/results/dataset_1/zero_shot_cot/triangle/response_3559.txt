Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

1. Let's write down all the triangles we find:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <2, 3, 5>
   - Triangle 3: <2, 5, 7>
   - Triangle 4: <3, 5, 7>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 4, 9>
   - Triangle 6: <3, 6, 9>

2. Count the total number of triangles we found.  
   Total number of triangles: [6]
