Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here is how we can proceed:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9. However, there are no triangles involving node 0 since nodes 5, 8, and 9 are not directly connected to each other.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7, but they are not connected to each other.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9. There are two triangles involving node 2: <2, 3, 4> and <2, 7, 9>.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6. There is one triangle involving node 3: <2, 3, 4>.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 9. There is one triangle involving node 4: <2, 3, 4>.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6. However, they are not connected in a triangle formation.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, 8. There is one triangle involving node 6: <3, 6, 7>.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 8, 9. There is one triangle involving node 7: <2, 7, 9>.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7. However, there are no triangles involving node 8.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7. There is one triangle involving node 9: <2, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is **[4]**. The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 4>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, and <2, 7, 9>.
