Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 2.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles (cycles of length 3) in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 2>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 3>
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 2>
- Triangle 4: <0, 5, 3>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 3>
- Triangle 6: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 7: <2, 5, 3>
- Triangle 8: <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle 9: <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle 10: <3, 4, 8>
- Triangle 11: <3, 5, 7>
- Triangle 12: <3, 7, 9>
- Triangle 13: <4, 8, 3>
- Triangle 14: <7, 5, 3>

There are 14 triangles in total, so the output should be: [14].
