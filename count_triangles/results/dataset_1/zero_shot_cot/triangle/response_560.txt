Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step. A triangle in a graph is a set of three nodes where each pair of nodes is connected by an edge.

1. Given Edges:
- (0, 3), (0, 9)
- (1, 8)
- (2, 6)
- (3, 0), (3, 8)
- (4, 6), (4, 7)
- (5, 6)
- (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9)
- (7, 4), (7, 6)
- (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 9)
- (9, 0), (9, 6), (9, 8)

2. Now, let's find the triangles:
-  (0, 3, 9) is a triangle.
-  (2, 4, 6) is a triangle.
-  (6, 8, 9) is a triangle.

3. Counting the total number of triangles: [3]

Therefore, in this graph, there are 3 triangles: <0, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <6, 8, 9>.
