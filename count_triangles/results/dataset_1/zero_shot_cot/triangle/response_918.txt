Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles can be found by examining all possible combinations of three nodes. Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:

1. <1, 6, 8>
2. <1, 6, 9>
3. <1, 8, 9>
4. <2, 6, 8>
5. <2, 6, 9>
6. <2, 7, 8>
7. <2, 8, 9>
8. <4, 7, 8>
9. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
