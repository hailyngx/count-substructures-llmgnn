Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
