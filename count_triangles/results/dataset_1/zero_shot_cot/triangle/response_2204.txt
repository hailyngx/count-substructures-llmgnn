Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. From the given edges:
- Triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 5>
- Triangles involving node 1: <1, 0, 9>
- Triangles involving node 2: <2, 0, 5>
- Triangles involving node 3: None
- Triangles involving node 5: <5, 2, 0>, <5, 2, 6>, <5, 2, 8>, <5, 2, 9>, <5, 0, 6>, <5, 0, 8>, <5, 0, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>
- Triangles involving node 6: None
- Triangles involving node 7: None
- Triangles involving node 8: None
- Triangles involving node 9: None

2. Counting the total number of triangles found: 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
