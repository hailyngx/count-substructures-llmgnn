Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: For each node, list the neighbors.  
Node 0: 2, 7  
Node 1: 2, 6, 9  
Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 9  
Node 3: 4  
Node 4: 3, 7, 8  
Node 5: 7  
Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 8  
Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6  
Node 8: 4, 6, 9  
Node 9: 1, 2, 8  

Step 2: Check for triangles.  
Triangles:  
<1, 6, 2>  
<1, 9, 2>  
<0, 7, 4>  
<0, 2, 6>  
<6, 8, 4>  

Total number of triangles: [5]
