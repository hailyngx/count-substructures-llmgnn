Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other, forming a triangle.

Looking at the given edges, we can list out the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <1, 4, 7>
5. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
