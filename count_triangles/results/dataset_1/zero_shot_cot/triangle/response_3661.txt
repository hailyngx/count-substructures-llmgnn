Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can start by listing the triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 8, 6>
3. <1, 0, 7>
4. <4, 5, 9>
5. <8, 3, 7>
6. <8, 9, 4>
7. <8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
