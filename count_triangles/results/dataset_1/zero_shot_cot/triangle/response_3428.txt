Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided.

Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:
1. Investigate each node to find any triangles it might be a part of:
   - Node 1 is connected to Node 8 (1, 8) and Node 8 is connected to Node 5 (8, 5). So, there is a triangle formed with nodes 1, 5, and 8.
2. Identify any other triangles:
   - Node 2 is connected to Node 6 (2, 6) and Node 6 is connected to Node 8 (6, 8) which is connected to Node 1 (8, 1). So, another triangle is formed with nodes 2, 1, and 8.
   - Node 6 is connected to Node 7 (6, 7) which is connected to Nodes 5 (7, 5) and 8 (7, 8). So, there is a triangle with nodes 5, 6, and 7.
3. List the unique triangles found: 
   - <1, 5, 8>, <2, 1, 8>, <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
