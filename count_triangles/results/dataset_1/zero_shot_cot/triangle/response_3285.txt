Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify all possible triangles based on the given edges.

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
4. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
5. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
6. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
7. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
8. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
9. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
10. Triangle <4, 9, 6>
11. Triangle <7, 8, 9>
12. Triangle <9, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph. So, the output is: [12]
