Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we represent the given graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Edges:
(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8)
(1, 4)
(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8)
(3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 8)
(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 9)
(5, 8), (5, 9)
(6, 3), (6, 4)
(8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5)
(9, 4), (9, 5)

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. 

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 9, 5>

Total number of triangles: [8]
