Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Create an adjacency matrix based on the given edges:
```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
0   0  1  0  0  0  1  1  0  0  1
1   1  0  1  0  0  1  0  1  0  0
2   0  1  0  0  1  1  0  1  0  1
3   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
4   0  0  1  0  0  1  1  0  0  1
5   1  1  1  0  1  0  0  0  0  0
6   1  0  0  0  1  0  0  1  1  0
7   0  1  1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
8   0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
9   1  0  1  0  1  0  0  0  0
