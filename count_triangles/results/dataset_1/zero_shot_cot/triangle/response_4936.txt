Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles present in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 1, 9>
4. Triangle <3, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
