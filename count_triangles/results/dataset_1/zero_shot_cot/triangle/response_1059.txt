Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
4. Node 4 is connected to node 7.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 1, 9 form a triangle.
- Triangle 2: Nodes 1, 5, 9 form a triangle.
- Triangle 3: Nodes 1, 6, 8 form a triangle.
- Triangle 4: Nodes 3, 5, 9 form a triangle.
- Triangle 5: Nodes 3, 8, 9 form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
