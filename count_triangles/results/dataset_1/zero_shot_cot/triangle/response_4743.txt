Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 2.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6.

Now, let's count the triangles (cycles of length 3) in the graph:

1. Triangle: <2, 8, 4>
2. Triangle: <2, 8, 5>
3. Triangle: <2, 4, 6>
4. Triangle: <2, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
