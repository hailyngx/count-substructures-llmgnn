Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
The unique triangles found are <1, 7, 2> and <7, 8, 9>.
