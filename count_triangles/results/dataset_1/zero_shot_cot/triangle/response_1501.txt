Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [3].
