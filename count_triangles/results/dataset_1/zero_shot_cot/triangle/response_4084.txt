Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Firstly, let's represent the given graph in terms of an adjacency list:
```
0: [1, 2, 5, 7, 8]
1: [0, 3, 7, 8]
2: [0, 4, 9]
3: [1, 5, 6, 9]
4: [2, 5, 6, 9]
5: [0, 3, 4, 6]
6: [3, 4, 5]
7: [0, 1, 8, 9]
8: [0, 1, 7]
9: [2, 3, 4, 7]
```

Now, we will count the total number of triangles by looking for nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Calculating the number of triangles:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <0, 2, 4>
4. <0, 5, 6>
5. <1, 3, 5>
6. <2, 4, 9>
7. <3, 4, 5>
8. Total number of triangles in the given graph is 7.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
