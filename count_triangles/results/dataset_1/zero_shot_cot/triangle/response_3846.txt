Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Triangle with nodes (0, 4, 6)
2. Triangle with nodes (0, 4, 8)
3. Triangle with nodes (0, 4, 9)
4. Triangle with nodes (0, 6, 8)
5. Triangle with nodes (0, 6, 9)
6. Triangle with nodes (4, 6, 8)
7. Triangle with nodes (4, 6, 9)

Thus, there are [7] triangles in total.
