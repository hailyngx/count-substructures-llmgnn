Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each set of three nodes and check if there is an edge between every pair. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes 0, 4, and 5 form a triangle as there are edges between (0, 4), (0, 5), and (4, 5).
   
2. Nodes 1, 5, and 6 also form a triangle as there are edges between (1, 5), (1, 6), and (5, 6).

3. There are no other triangles in this graph based on the given edges.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles are <0, 4, 5> and <1, 5, 6>.
