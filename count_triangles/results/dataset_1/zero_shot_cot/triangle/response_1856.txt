Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles present in the graph:
1. (0, 4, 1)
2. (0, 4, 9)
3. (0, 1, 8)
4. (0, 8, 5)
5. (1, 4, 9)
6. (1, 4, 7)
7. (1, 7, 5)
8. (2, 5, 7)
9. (4, 9, 1)
10. (5, 8, 0)

There are 10 triangles in total. So, the answer is [10].
