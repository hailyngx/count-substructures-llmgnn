Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles by looking for nodes that are connected in a way that forms a closed loop of 3 edges. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 0, 8>
<4, 3, 9>
<6, 4, 9>
<8, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
