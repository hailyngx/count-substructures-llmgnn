Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the possible triangles in the graph:

Triangles involving node 0:  
- <0, 3, 8>
  
Triangles involving node 1:  
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 6>

Triangles involving node 2:  
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 8>
  
Triangles involving node 3:  
- <3, 4, 6>

Triangles involving node 4:  
- <0, 3, 4>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 5, 6>

Triangles involving node 5:  
- <1, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 5>

Triangles involving node 6:  
- <3, 4, 6>
- <6, 8, 9>

Triangles involving node 7:  
- No triangles

Triangles involving node 8:  
- <0, 2, 8>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <6, 8, 9>

Triangles involving node 9:  
- No triangles

Adding all unique triangles found, there are [9] triangles in total.
