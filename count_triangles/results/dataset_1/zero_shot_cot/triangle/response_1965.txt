Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
2. Edges:
   - (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 2), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 6), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Let's identify the triangles:
1. <1, 7, 6>
2. <1, 8, 9>

Count of triangles: [2]
