Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will examine each possible set of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <0, 4, 7>
5. <1, 4, 9>
6. <3, 4, 9>
7. <3, 8, 9>
8. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
