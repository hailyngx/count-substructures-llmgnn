Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to check for each triplet of nodes whether all three edges are present. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0: Triangles involving node 0:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 4, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 6, 8>

2. Node 1: Triangles involving node 1:
   - Triangle 5: <1, 0, 4>
   - Triangle 6: <1, 3, 8>

3. Node 3: Triangles involving node 3:
   - Triangle 7: <3, 1, 8>
   - Triangle 8: <3, 4, 9>

4. Node 4: Triangles involving node 4:
   - Triangle 9: <4, 0, 6>
   - Triangle 10: <4, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 11: <4, 8, 6>
   - Triangle 12: <4, 9, 6>

5. Node 6: Triangles involving node 6:
   - Triangle 13: <6, 0, 2>
   - Triangle 14: <6, 8, 9>

6. Node 8: Triangles involving node 8:
   - Triangle 15: <8, 0, 1>
   - Triangle 16: <8, 3, 4>
   - Triangle 17: <8, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 18: <8, 6, 9>

7. Node 9: Triangles involving node 9:
   - Triangle 19: <9, 3, 4>
   - Triangle 20: <9, 4, 6>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
