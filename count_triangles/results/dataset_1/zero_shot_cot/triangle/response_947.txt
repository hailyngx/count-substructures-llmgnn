Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the connected nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
8. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
9. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
