Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 7>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9.
   - Triangles <0, 1, 2>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 7, 9>

3. Node 2 is connected to node 1.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.

5. Node 4 is connected to node 9.

6. Node 5 is connected to node 8.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
   - Triangle <3, 6, 7>

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 9.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 5. So, the answer is [5].
