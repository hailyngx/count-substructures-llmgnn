Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by sets of three connected nodes. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
