Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Given the following edges:
- (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 4), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5).

We can identify the triangles in the graph:

1. (0, 3, 5)
2. (1, 3, 5)
3. (1, 5, 9)
4. (3, 5, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, and <3, 5, 9>.
