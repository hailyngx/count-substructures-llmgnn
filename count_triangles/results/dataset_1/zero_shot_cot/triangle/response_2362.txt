Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other (i.e., each node is connected to the other two nodes). Let's find these triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle containing nodes 0, 1, and 4: (0, 1), (1, 4), (0, 4)
2. Triangle containing nodes 3, 4, and 9: (3, 4), (4, 9), (3, 9)
3. Triangle containing nodes 3, 5, and 9: (3, 5), (5, 9), (3, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <3, 4, 9>, and <3, 5, 9>.
