Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's calculate the number of triangles step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 5, 4>
- <0, 7, 5>
- <0, 8, 2>
- <1, 3, 2>
- <1, 6, 4>
- <2, 7, 5>
- <3, 1, 4>
- <3, 9, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
