Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided.

Let's list down the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <0, 5, 7>
5. <1, 2, 3>
6. <1, 6, 7>
7. <2, 3, 9>
8. <4, 5, 7>
9. <4, 5, 9>
10. <5, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [10]
