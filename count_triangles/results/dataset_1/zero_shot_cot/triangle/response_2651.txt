Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles present in the given graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
4. Triangle <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
