Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each possible triangle formed by three nodes.

Let's first identify all the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
6. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
7. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
8. Triangle <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
