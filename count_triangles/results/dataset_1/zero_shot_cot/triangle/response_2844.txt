Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that form a triangle.

Looking at the provided edges, we can see the following triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle 3: <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle 4: <1, 7, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle 6: <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle 7: <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle 8: <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the total number of triangles is [8].
