Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by three connected nodes.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes adjacent to each node:
   - Node 0: {2, 5, 7}
   - Node 1: {3, 7}
   - Node 2: {0, 4, 6}
   - Node 3: {1}
   - Node 4: {2, 6, 8, 9}
   - Node 5: {0}
   - Node 6: {2, 4}
   - Node 7: {0, 1, 9}
   - Node 8: {4}
   - Node 9: {4, 7}

2. Let's find the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 2, 6>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 6: <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
