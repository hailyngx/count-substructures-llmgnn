Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [2].

The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6> and <4, 5, 9>.
