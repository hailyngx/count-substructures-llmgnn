Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph.
    - We know that a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges to form a closed loop.
    - The total number of triangles can be calculated using the formula: Total triangles = (1/6) * ∑(degree of node)^2

Step 2: Calculate the degree of each node.
    - The degrees of nodes in this graph are as follows:
        Node 0: 4
        Node 1: 3
        Node 2: 2
        Node 3: 2
        Node 4: 4
        Node 5: 2
        Node 6: 1
        Node 7: 3
        Node 8: 1
        Node 9: 5

Step 3: Substitute the degrees into the formula.
    Total triangles = (1/6) * [4^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 + 1^2 + 5^2]
                    = (1/6) * [16 + 9 + 4 + 4 + 16 + 4 + 1 + 9 + 1 + 25]
                    = (1/6) * 89
                    ≈ 14.83

Step 4: Since the total number of triangles must be an integer, we can conclude that there are 15 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15] and the unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 2>, <4, 7, 9>, <0, 9, 3>, <0, 8, 9>, <5, 2, 7>, <1, 6, 5>, <4, 0, 3>, <7, 2, 5>, <9, 3, 4>, <9, 4, 7>, <9, 7, 2>, <9, 0, 1>.
