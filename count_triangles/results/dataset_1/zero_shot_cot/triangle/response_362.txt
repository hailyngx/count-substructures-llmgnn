Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in a graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list all the triangles present in this graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <1, 5, 9>

Count of triangles: [3]
