Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We'll go step-by-step to identify and count the triangles:

1. Checking all possible triangles:
- Possible triangles involving node 0: None
- Possible triangles involving node 1: None
- Possible triangles involving node 2: None
- Possible triangles involving node 3: None
- Possible triangles involving node 4: None
- Possible triangles involving node 5: Triangle found <0, 2, 5>
- Possible triangles involving node 6: None
- Possible triangles involving node 7: None
- Possible triangles involving node 8: None
- Possible triangles involving node 9: None

2. Total number of triangles: [1]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1], and the unique triangle found is <0, 2, 5>.
