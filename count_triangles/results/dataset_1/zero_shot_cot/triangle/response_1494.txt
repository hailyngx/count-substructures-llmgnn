Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is not part of any triangles as it is connected to only one node.
2. Nodes 1, 2, 4 form a triangle. <1, 2, 4>
3. Nodes 1, 3, 5 form a triangle. <1, 3, 5>
4. Nodes 1, 7, 9 form a triangle. <1, 7, 9>
5. Nodes 2, 5, 6 form a triangle. <2, 5, 6>
6. Nodes 2, 7, 9 form a triangle. <2, 7, 9>
7. Nodes 3, 5, 6 form a triangle. <3, 5, 6>
8. Nodes 4, 7, 9 form a triangle. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
