Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges provided. 

Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangles formed by nodes (0, 5, 8): <0, 5, 8>
2. Triangles formed by nodes (1, 3, 7): <1, 3, 7>
3. Triangles formed by nodes (2, 5, 7): <2, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
