Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify all the triangles formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles that exist in the graph:
1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <1, 2, 7>

Count of triangles: [4]
