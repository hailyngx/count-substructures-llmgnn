Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other, completing a loop. 

Looking at the edges provided:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Hence, we can see the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <0, 4, 2>
3. <1, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
