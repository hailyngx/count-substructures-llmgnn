Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each set of three nodes and check if they form a triangle by checking if there are edges connecting each pair of nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Let's list out all the triangles in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 5, 7>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 2, 5>
   - Triangle 3: <3, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <3, 6, 8>
   - Triangle 5: <4, 6, 8>
   - Triangle 6: <5, 0, 1>
   - Triangle 7: <5, 3, 8>
   - Triangle 8: <5, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 9: <6, 3, 8>
   - Triangle 10: <8, 4, 6>
   
2. Count the total number of unique triangles: [10]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
