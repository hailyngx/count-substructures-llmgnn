Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <3, 4, 8>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
