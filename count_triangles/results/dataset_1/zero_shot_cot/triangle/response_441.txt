Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let us identify the triangles present in the given graph:
1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 1, 4
2. Triangle involving nodes 1, 6, 7
3. Triangle involving nodes 1, 8, 9
4. Triangle involving nodes 1, 3, 8

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
