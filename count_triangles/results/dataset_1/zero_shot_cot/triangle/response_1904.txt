Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Taking a step-by-step approach:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6. 
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5>
   - Triangle <0, 2, 6>
   - Triangle <0, 5, 6>

2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
   - Triangle <1, 2, 4>
   - Triangle <1, 2, 6>
   - Triangle <1, 4, 6>

3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 2>
   - Triangle <2, 1, 4>
   - Triangle <2, 3, 4>

4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 2 and 4. No triangles here.

5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8.
   - Triangle <1, 2, 4>
   - Triangle <1, 4, 7>
   - Triangle <1, 4, 8>

6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0 and 6. No triangles here.

7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 6>

8. Node 7: Connected to node 4. No triangles here.

9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 4 and 9. No triangles here.

10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 6 and 8. No triangles here.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
