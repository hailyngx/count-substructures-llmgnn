Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we first need to identify the unique triangles formed by the given edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other, directly or indirectly.

Let's list down the unique triangles present in the graph:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
