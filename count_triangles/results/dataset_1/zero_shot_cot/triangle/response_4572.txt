Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for combinations of three nodes that form a triangle. 

From the given edges, the triangles in this graph can be formed by looking at the cycles that involve three nodes. Let's go through the process:
1. Check the cycles through each node:
    - Node 0 can form triangles with nodes 1, 5, 6, 8, 9.
    - Node 1 can form triangles with nodes 4, 5, 7.
    - Node 2 and 3 do not form any triangles in this case.
    - Node 4 can form triangles with nodes 5 and 8.
    - Node 5 does not form any triangles with the given edges.
    - Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9.
    - Node 7 does not form any triangles with the given edges.
    - Node 8 does not form any triangles with the given edges.
    - Node 9 does not form any triangles with the given edges.

2. List the unique triangles found:
    - <0, 1, 5>
    - <0, 1, 8>
    - <0, 1, 6>
    - <0, 1, 9>
    - <0, 5, 8>
    - <0, 5, 9>
    - <0, 6, 9>

3. Count the total number of unique triangles: [7]

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
