Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will examine each combination of 3 nodes. If all possible edges between these 3 nodes exist, then we have found a triangle.

1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 1, 7>
4. <0, 2, 9>
5. <1, 4, 9>
6. <2, 3, 9>
7. <3, 4, 9>
8. <3, 4, 1>
9. <5, 1, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
