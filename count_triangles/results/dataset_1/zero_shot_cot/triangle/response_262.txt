Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the connected nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 5.
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.

Now, let's identify the unique triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
4. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
