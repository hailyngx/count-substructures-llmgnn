Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step by step to identify the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2 to form the triangle <0, 1, 2>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8. However, we already counted the triangle with nodes 0, 1, and 2. So, node 1 forms two more triangles: <1, 4, 8> and <1, 2, 4>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6, completing the triangle <0, 1, 2> again.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 9. There are no new triangles formed with node 3.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3, completing the triangle <1, 3, 4>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 6. There are no new triangles formed with node 5.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8, forming the triangle <2, 5, 6>.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9 to complete the triangle <3, 5, 7>.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 6, but no additional triangles are formed.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 7, but no additional triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, and <2, 5, 6>.
