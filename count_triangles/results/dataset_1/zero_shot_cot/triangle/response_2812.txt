Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to find all triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles we find:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 2, 6>
4. <0, 4, 5>
5. <2, 4, 5>
6. <2, 4, 9>
7. <2, 5, 9>
8. <4, 5, 9>
9. <2, 8, 9>
10. <4, 8, 9>

There are a total of 10 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
