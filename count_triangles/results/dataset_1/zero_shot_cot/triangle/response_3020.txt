Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph based on the given edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected with edges in a closed loop. We can do this by checking each possible combination of three nodes from the given graph:

1. For node 0: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8)
2. For node 1: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7)
3. For node 2: (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 7)
4. For node 3: (3, 2), (3, 9)
5. For node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 8)
6. For node 5: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8)
7. For node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9)
8. For node 8: (8, 0), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7)
9. For node 9: (9, 3), (9, 7)

Next, let's list the triangles found:
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <2, 7, 5>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
