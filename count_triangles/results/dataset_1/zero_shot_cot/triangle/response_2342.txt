Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's calculate the number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 4 and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6.

Let's list the triangles one by one:
1. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
5. Triangle <5, 6, 9>
6. Triangle <0, 7, 1>
7. Triangle <0, 7, 2>
8. Triangle <0, 8, 1>
9. Triangle <7, 1, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
