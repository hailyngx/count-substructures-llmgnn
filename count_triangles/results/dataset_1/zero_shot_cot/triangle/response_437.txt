Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every set of three nodes that form a triangle. A triangle consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Let's list down the possible triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 7, 9>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <2, 5, 6>
5. <3, 4, 6>
6. <3, 6, 8>
7. <5, 6, 9>
8. <7, 0, 9>
9. <7, 1, 9>

Counting the number of unique triangles in total, we find that there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
