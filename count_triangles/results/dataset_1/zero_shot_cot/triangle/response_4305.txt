Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the given edges. Let's analyze the graph:

The graph has the following edges:
1. 0 - 5
2. 0 - 7
3. 0 - 8
4. 1 - 3
5. 3 - 1
6. 4 - 6
7. 5 - 0
8. 6 - 4
9. 7 - 0
10. 8 - 0
11. 8 - 9
12. 9 - 8

Let's find the triangles present in the graph:
1. Nodes 0, 5, 7 form a triangle. (<0, 5, 7>)
2. Nodes 0, 5, 8 form a triangle. (<0, 5, 8>)

Count of total triangles: [2]
