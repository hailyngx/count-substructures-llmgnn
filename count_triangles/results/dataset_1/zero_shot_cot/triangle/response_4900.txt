Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. We will look for triangles by checking every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

2. By observing the given edges, we can determine the following triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 1, 7>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 2, 6>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 2, 9>
   - Triangle 5: <1, 2, 7>
   - Triangle 6: <1, 2, 9>
   - Triangle 7: <2, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 8: <2, 6, 9>
   - Triangle 9: <2, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 10: <6, 7, 9>

3. Combining these unique triangles, we have a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
   (Each triangle is listed only once inside <> brackets)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
