Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
   - <0, 2, 6>
   - <0, 2, 7>

2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 5 and 8.
   - No triangles involving node 1.

3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
   - <0, 2, 6>

4. Node 3: Connected to node 9.
   - No triangles involving node 3.

5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 5 and 7.
   - No triangles involving node 4.

6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9.
   - <1, 5, 9>
   - <2, 5, 9>
   - <4, 5, 9>

7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 0 and 2.
   - No triangles involving node 6.

8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
   - No triangles involving node 7.

9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
   - <1, 8, 9>

10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
   - <3, 9, 5>
   - <8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 9, 5>, and <8, 9, 5>.
