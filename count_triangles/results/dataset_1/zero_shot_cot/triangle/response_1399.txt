Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's analyze each node and its neighbors to see if there exist any triangles.

1. Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8) - No triangles involving node 0.
2. Node 1: (1, 6) - No triangles involving node 1.
3. Node 2: (2, 7) - No triangles involving node 2.
4. Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 6)- Possible triangles: <3, 4, 6>.
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5) - Possible triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>.
6. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 8) - Possible triangles: <0, 4, 5>.
7. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 9) - Possible triangles: <1, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 6>.
8. Node 7: (7, 2) - No triangles involving node 7.
9. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 5) - No triangles involving node 8.
10. Node 9: (9, 6) - No triangles involving node 9.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in total, and they are <0, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6> and <4, 5, 0>. The output is [5].
