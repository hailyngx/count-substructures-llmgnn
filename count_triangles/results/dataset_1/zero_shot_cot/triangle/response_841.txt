Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three vertices that form a triangle. A triangle occurs when three nodes are connected to each other through edges.

Let's list the triangles step-by-step:
1. (0, 2, 5)
2. (0, 5, 6)
3. (0, 6, 9)
4. (0, 2, 3)
5. (0, 8, 9)

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 8, 9>.
