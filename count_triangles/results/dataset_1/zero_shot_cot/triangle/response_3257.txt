Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for closed loops of length 3, which represent triangles. 

Here are the triangles present in the graph:

1. <1, 4, 9>
2. <1, 9, 2>
3. <1, 9, 4>
4. <4, 9, 8>
5. <8, 9, 1>
6. <8, 9, 4>
7. <9, 1, 4>
8. <9, 1, 2>
9. <9, 2, 1>
10. <9, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
