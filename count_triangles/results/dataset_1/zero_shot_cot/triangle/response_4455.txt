Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for nodes that form triangles by connecting to each other. Let's go step by step:
1. Node 0 has connections with nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1 has connections with node 7.
3. Node 2 has connections with nodes 5 and 6.
4. Node 3 has connections with nodes 0 and 9.
5. Node 4 has a connection with node 0.
6. Node 5 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, and 8.
7. Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
8. Node 7 has connections with nodes 1, 5, and 8.
9. Node 8 has connections with nodes 5, 6, and 7.
10. Node 9 has connections with nodes 0 and 3.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 5, 6)
- Triangle 2: (7, 5, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 6> and <7, 5, 8>.
