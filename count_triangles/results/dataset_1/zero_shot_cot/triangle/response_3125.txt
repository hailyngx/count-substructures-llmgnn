Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Nodes with degree 2 or more:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 8
   - Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 9
   - Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 6, 9
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 8, 9
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 6
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4

2. Triangles involving nodes with degree 2 or more:
   - <0, 1, 2>
   - <0, 1, 4>
   - <1, 3, 9>
   - <2, 4, 9>

3. Total number of unique triangles = 4

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
