Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5>
   - Triangle <0, 2, 6>

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
   - Triangle <0, 2, 4>
   
3. Node 3 is connected to node 7.

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.

6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8.

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.

9. Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
