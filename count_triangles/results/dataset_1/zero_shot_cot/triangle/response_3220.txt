Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will check each possible combination of three nodes and see if they form a triangle (i.e., each node is connected to the other two nodes).

Let's start by listing out the unique triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <1, 5, 6>
4. <1, 6, 8>

Now, we count the total number of triangles. The answer is:
