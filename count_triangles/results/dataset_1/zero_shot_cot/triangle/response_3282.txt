Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the possible triangles:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 2, 7>
4. <2, 4, 8>
5. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
