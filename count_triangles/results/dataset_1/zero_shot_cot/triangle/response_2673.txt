Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other. Let's list down the triangles we can find.

Triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 6, 5>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 3>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles. There are 5 triangles in total.

Therefore, the answer is [5].
