Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

First, we need to identify the triangles by finding nodes that are connected to each other forming a closed loop of edges (i.e., triangles).

The triangles present in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
