Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. For each node, look at all pairs of neighbors connected to that node. For example:
   - Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9)
   - Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5)
   - Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4)
   - Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
   - Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 9)
   - Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9)
   - Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7)
   - Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8)
   - Node 8: (8, 7)
   - Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 5)

2. Check which of these pairs have a common neighbor to form triangles. For example, let's list the triangles:
   - <0, 2, 1>
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <0, 3, 5>
   - <0, 5, 9>
   - <1, 2, 4>
   - <3, 4, 5>
   - <5, 6, 7>
   - <5, 7, 9>

3. Count the total number of unique triangles as requested.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is:
