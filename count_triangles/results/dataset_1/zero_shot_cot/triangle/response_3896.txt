Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected (form a triangle). 

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to Node 1.
2. Node 1 is connected to Nodes 0, 2, and 3.
3. Node 2 is connected to Nodes 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to Node 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to Node 2.
7. Node 6 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to Nodes 2 and 3.
9. Node 8 is connected to Nodes 2 and 3.
10. Node 9 is connected to Nodes 2 and 6.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- <1, 2, 3>
- <2, 6, 9> 

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
