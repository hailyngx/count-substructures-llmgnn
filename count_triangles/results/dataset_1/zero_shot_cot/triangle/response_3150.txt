Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. Here are the unique triangles found:

<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 3>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 3>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 3>

Total number of triangles: [8]
