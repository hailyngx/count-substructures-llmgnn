Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. 

Let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <2, 4, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [4]
