Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by identifying the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 1, 5)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 4, 8)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 5, 7)
4. Triangle 4: (4, 5, 8)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles found: [4]
