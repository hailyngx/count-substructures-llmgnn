Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. For each edge in the graph, check if there is a third node that connects the two nodes of the edge to form a triangle.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <1, 6, 3>
- <1, 6, 5>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
