Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of adjacency list:

0: [7, 8, 9]
1: [6]
2: [3, 9]
3: [2, 4, 5, 7, 8]
4: [3, 7]
5: [3, 6, 9]
6: [1, 5]
7: [0, 3, 4]
8: [0, 3]
9: [0, 2, 5]

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.

Calculating triangles in the graph:
- Triangle <0, 7, 3>
- Triangle <0, 8, 3>
- Triangle <0, 9, 2>
- Triangle <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle <3, 5, 9>

So there are 5 triangles in total [5].
