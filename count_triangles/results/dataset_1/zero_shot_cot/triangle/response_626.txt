Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for combinations of three nodes that form a triangle. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with its neighbors: (0, 1, 4), (0, 7, 8)
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with its neighbors: (1, 0, 2)
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with its neighbors: (2, 1, 8)
4. Node 3 does not form any triangles.
5. Node 4 forms triangles with its neighbors: (4, 0, 5), (4, 9, 5)
6. Node 5 forms triangles with its neighbors: (5, 4, 9), (5, 8, 9)
7. Node 6 forms a triangle with its neighbors: (6, 3, 5), (6, 5, 9)
8. Node 7 does not form any triangles.
9. Node 8 forms triangles with its neighbors: (8, 0, 2), (8, 5, 9)
10. Node 9 forms a triangle with its neighbors: (9, 4, 5), (9, 5, 6)

Combining all the unique triangles found, we get: [<(0, 1, 4)>, <(0, 7, 8)>, <(1, 0, 2)>, <(4, 0, 5)>, <(4, 9, 5)>, <(5, 8, 9)>, <(6, 3, 5)>, <(6, 5, 9)>, <(8, 0, 2)>, <(8, 5, 9)>, <(9, 4, 5)>, <(9, 5, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
