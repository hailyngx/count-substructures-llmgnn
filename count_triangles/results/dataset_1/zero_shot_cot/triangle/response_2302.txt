Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, we can start finding the triangles by checking every combination of three nodes. Let's list the unique triangles we find:

1. <1, 2, 9>
2. <2, 7, 9>
3. <2, 8, 9>
4. <3, 5, 7>
5. <4, 7, 9>
6. <5, 7, 8>
7. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [7]
