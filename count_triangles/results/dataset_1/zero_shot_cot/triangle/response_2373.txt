Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Identify triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 2, 3)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 6, 9)
   - Triangle 4: (0, 8, 9)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 3, 8)
   - Triangle 6: (3, 6, 9)
   
2. Count the total number of unique triangles: [6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 6.
