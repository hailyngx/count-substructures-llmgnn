Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, there is a total of 4 triangles present. Here are the unique triangles found:
1. <0, 1, 7>  
2. <0, 5, 9>  
3. <1, 3, 2>  
4. <0, 7, 1>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
