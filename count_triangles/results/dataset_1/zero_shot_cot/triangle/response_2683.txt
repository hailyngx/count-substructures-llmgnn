Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles present in the graph:
- Triangles involving node 0: None
- Triangles involving node 1: None
- Triangles involving node 2: None
- Triangles involving node 3: None
- Triangles involving node 4: None
- Triangles involving node 5: None
- Triangles involving node 6: None
- Triangles involving node 7: None
- Triangles involving node 8: None
- Triangles involving node 9: <1, 6, 9> 
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
