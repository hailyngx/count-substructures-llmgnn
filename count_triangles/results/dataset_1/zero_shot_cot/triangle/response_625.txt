Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0,1,2), (0,3,4), (0,4,5)
2. Node 1: (1,0,6), (1,0,8), (1,0,9), (1,6,8), (1,8,9)
3. Node 2: (2,0,8)
4. Node 3: (3,0,4), (3,0,6), (3,0,9), (3,4,6), (3,4,9), (3,6,9)
5. Node 4: (4,0,5), (4,3,5), (4,5,8)
6. Node 5: (5,0,9)
7. Node 6: (6,1,3)
8. Node 8: (8,1,2), (8,1,4)
9. Node 9: (9,1,3), (9,1,5)

Now, count the total number of unique triangles:
