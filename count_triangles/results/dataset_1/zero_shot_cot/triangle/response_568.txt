Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the triangles by finding sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.

Now, let's identify the unique triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <5, 7, 8>
5. <6, 8, 9>

Counting the number of triangles: [5]
