Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze this graph step by step to count the number of triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.

Now, let's count the triangles in this graph:
- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 2)
- Triangle 2: (0, 5, 8)
- Triangle 3: (0, 5, 9)
- Triangle 4: (2, 3, 6)
- Triangle 5: (4, 5, 9)
- Triangle 6: (0, 8, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in this graph. The triangles are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, and <0, 8, 9>. 

So, the total number of triangles is [6].
