Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for complete subgraphs of size 3 (triangles). 

From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <3, 4, 5>
3. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
