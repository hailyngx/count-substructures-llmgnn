Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Looking at the graph with the provided edges, we can find the following triangles:
    - <0, 2, 4>
    - <0, 4, 5>
    - <0, 6, 8>
    - <4, 5, 7>
    
There are 4 unique triangles in total, so the number of triangles in the given graph is [<4>].
