Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by listing all the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <1, 6, 7>
3. <2, 5, 6>
4. <5, 6, 8>
5. <6, 8, 9>

There are 5 triangles in total. Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
