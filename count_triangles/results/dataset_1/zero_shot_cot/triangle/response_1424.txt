Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by three nodes connected by edges. 

Let's list down the unique triangles:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <1, 6, 8>
6. <1, 7, 8>

Counting the number of unique triangles:
