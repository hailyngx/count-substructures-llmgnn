Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by groups of three vertices connected by edges.

After analyzing the provided edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
1. <1, 5, 8>
2. <1, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
