Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 2, 6)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 3, 4)

Based on the given edges, these are the two unique triangles in the graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
