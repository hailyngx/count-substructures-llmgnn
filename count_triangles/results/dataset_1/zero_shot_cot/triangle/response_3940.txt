Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by vertices connected by edges. A triangle is formed when three vertices are all connected to each other.

From the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <1, 4, 5>
6. <1, 4, 7>
7. <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
