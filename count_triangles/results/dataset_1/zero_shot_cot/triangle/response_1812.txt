Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a closed triangle.

Let's enumerate the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 6, 7>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <1, 2, 5>
5. <2, 5, 6>
6. <6, 7, 9>

Count of triangles: [6]
