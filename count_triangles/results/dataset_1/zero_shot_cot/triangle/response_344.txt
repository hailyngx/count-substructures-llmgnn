Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 8. However, nodes 7 and 8 are not directly connected. So, no triangle includes node 0.
   
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 4. However, nodes 3 and 4 are not directly connected. So, no triangle includes node 1.
   
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 9. However, nodes 4 and 9 are not directly connected. So, no triangle includes node 2.
   
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. Node 1 and 8 are connected, forming a triangle with node 3: <1, 3, 8>.
   
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6. However, there are no triangles involving all three of these nodes.
   
6. Node 5 is not part of any triangle as it only has one connection to node 7.
   
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8. However, there are no triangles involving all three of these nodes.
   
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6. However, there are no triangles involving all three of these nodes.
   
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6. However, there are no triangles involving all three of these nodes.
   
10. Node 9 is not part of any triangle as it only has one connection to node 2.
   
From our analysis, we found one triangle: <1, 3, 8>. So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
