Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all the triangles present in the graph by examining every set of three nodes that are connected by edges.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

After analyzing the provided edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
- <0, 4, 2>
- <1, 6, 4>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <4, 8, 5>
- <4, 8, 7>
- <4, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
