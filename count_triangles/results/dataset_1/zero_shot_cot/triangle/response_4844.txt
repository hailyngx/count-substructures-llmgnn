Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in the given graph, we will need to identify all possible triangles by finding nodes that are connected in a triangular manner. A triangle consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Here are the unique triangles in the given graph:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 8, 2>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 9, 0>
<4, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
