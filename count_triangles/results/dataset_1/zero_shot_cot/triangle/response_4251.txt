Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in a graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step:

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.

<0, 5, 8>

Moving to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 8, and 9.

<1, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>

Moving to node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8.

<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 8>

Moving to node 3:
- We've already covered the triangles involving node 3.

Moving to node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to node 8.

Moving to node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 7.

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 7>

Moving to node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.

<5, 6, 9>

Moving to node 7:
- We've already covered the triangles involving node 7.

Moving to node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.

Moving to node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.

<1, 6, 9>

So, in total, there are 15 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the output is [15].
