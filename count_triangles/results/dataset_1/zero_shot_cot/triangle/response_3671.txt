Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine every set of three nodes and check if each pair of nodes is connected by an edge.

Let's start by identifying the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
6. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
7. Triangle <4, 6, 2>
8. Triangle <4, 6, 5>
9. Triangle <4, 0, 8>
10. Triangle <7, 1, 9>
11. Triangle <7, 2, 5>
12. Triangle <9, 8, 0>
13. Triangle <9, 7, 1>

Therefore, there are a total of 13 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [13].
