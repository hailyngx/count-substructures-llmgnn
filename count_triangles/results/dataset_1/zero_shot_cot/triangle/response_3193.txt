Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all the instances where three nodes are connected to each other, forming a triangle. To simplify this process, we can ignore the directions of the edges.

Let's start by listing all the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <2, 4, 5>
5. <2, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
