Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 8.

Now, we can count the number of triangles formed by checking nodes connected to each other:
- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 4)
- Triangle 2: (1, 4, 5)
- Triangle 3: (1, 4, 9)
- Triangle 4: (2, 5, 7)
- Triangle 5: (2, 6, 9)
- Triangle 6: (3, 4, 6)
- Triangle 7: (3, 6, 9)
- Triangle 8: (4, 5, 7)
- Triangle 9: (4, 6, 7)
- Triangle 10: (6, 7, 9)

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. So, the output should be [10].
