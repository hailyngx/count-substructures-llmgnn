Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all the triangles formed by 3 connected nodes.

Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. Some triangles based on the given edges:
   - Triangle 1: <1, 3, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 3: <1, 5, 2>
   - Triangle 4: <5, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 5: <6, 7, 1>

2. Now, let's check if there are any additional triangles:
   - Triangle 6: <1, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
