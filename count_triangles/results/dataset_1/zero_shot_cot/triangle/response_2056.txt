Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, and <2, 8, 9>.
