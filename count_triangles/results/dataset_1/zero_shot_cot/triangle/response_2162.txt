Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a triangle. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Nodes connected to Node 0: 1, 6
2. Nodes connected to Node 1: 0, 5, 6
3. Nodes connected to Node 2: 3, 5, 9
4. Nodes connected to Node 3: 2, 6
5. Nodes connected to Node 4: 8
6. Nodes connected to Node 5: 1, 2
7. Nodes connected to Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9
8. Nodes connected to Node 8: 4, 6, 9
9. Nodes connected to Node 9: 2, 6, 8

Now let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle 2: <2, 5, 9>
3. Triangle 3: <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
