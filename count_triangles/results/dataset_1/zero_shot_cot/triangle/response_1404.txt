Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's go through each node and its neighbors to find the triangles:

Node 0: No triangles as it has only one neighbor.

Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 8, 9. No triangle involving node 1.

Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 9. Possible triangle with nodes (1, 2, 9).

Node 3: Neighbors are 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. Possible triangles with nodes (2, 3, 9), (3, 4, 8).

Node 4: Neighbors are 2, 3, 5, 8. Possible triangle with nodes (2, 4, 8).

Node 5: Neighbors are 3, 4, 9. No triangles involving node 5.

Node 6: Neighbors are 3, 7, 8. No triangles involving node 6.

Node 7: Neighbor is 6. No triangles involving node 7.

Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 6. No triangles involving node 8.

Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 5. No triangles involving node 9.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, and <3, 4, 8>.
