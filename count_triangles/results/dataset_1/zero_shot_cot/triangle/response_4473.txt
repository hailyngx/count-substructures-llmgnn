Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles formed by the edges provided:
- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 2)
- Triangle 2: (0, 3, 4)
- Triangle 3: (0, 4, 2)
- Triangle 4: (0, 4, 9)
- Triangle 5: (0, 9, 5)
- Triangle 6: (0, 7, 5)
- Triangle 7: (0, 7, 9)
- Triangle 8: (0, 8, 1)
- Triangle 9: (1, 8, 0)
- Triangle 10: (2, 3, 4)
- Triangle 11: (4, 2, 9)
- Triangle 12: (5, 9, 0)
- Triangle 13: (5, 9, 7)
- Triangle 14: (6, 7, 9)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles and list them:
- Total number of triangles: [14]
