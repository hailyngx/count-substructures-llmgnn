Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles present in the graph:

1. (0, 6, 1)
2. (0, 6, 8)
3. (0, 8, 2)
4. (1, 2, 6)
5. (1, 7, 8)
6. (2, 6, 8)
7. (3, 4, 6)
8. (3, 8, 9)
9. (4, 6, 8)
10. (7, 8, 9)

There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
