Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's define a triangle in a graph as a set of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes within the set. To find the total number of triangles in this graph, we can examine each set of three nodes and check if they form a triangle based on the given edges.

By examining the given edges, we can identify that the possible triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <1, 4, 9>
5. <1, 5, 9>
6. <3, 2, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
