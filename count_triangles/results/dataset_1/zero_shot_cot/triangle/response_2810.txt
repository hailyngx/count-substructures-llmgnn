Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given graph:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 2), (0, 8), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 2)

We will calculate the number of triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Calculate the triangles formed by each node:
- Node 0: (0, 2, 8)
- Node 1: (1, 4, 6)
- Node 2: (0, 2, 6), (2, 6, 9)
- Node 3: (3, 6, 8)
- Node 4: (1, 4, 6)
- Node 5: (5, 6, -)
- Node 6: (2, 6, 3), (2, 6, 4), (2, 6, 5), (2, 6, 8), (3, 6, 4), (3, 6, 8), (4, 6, -), (5, 6, -), (6, 8, -)
- Node 7: (7, 8, -)
- Node 8: (0, 2, 8), (3, 6, 8), (6, 8, 7)
- Node 9: (2, 6, 9)

2. Count total triangles:
- There are 1 triangle for node 0, 2 triangles for node 1, 2 triangles for node 2, 1 triangle for node 3, 1 triangle for node 4, 0 triangles for node 5, 9 triangles for node 6, 0 triangles for node 7, 3 triangles for node 8, and 1 triangle for node 9.

Total number of triangles: [22]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 7>
