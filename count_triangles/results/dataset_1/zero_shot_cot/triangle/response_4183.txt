Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's count the number of triangles.

To find triangles, we look for nodes that are connected to each other in a triangular form. In this case, we look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to both of the other two nodes.

Let's list the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 9>

Count of triangles: [4]
