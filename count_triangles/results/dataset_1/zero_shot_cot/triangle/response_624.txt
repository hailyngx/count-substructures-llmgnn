Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 4, 9)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 3, 7)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 3, 9)
4. Triangle 4: (2, 3, 7)
5. Triangle 5: (2, 3, 9)
6. Triangle 6: (3, 5, 7)
7. Triangle 7: (3, 5, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, and <3, 5, 9>.
