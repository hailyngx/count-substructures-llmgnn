Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's list the triangles present in the given graph and then count the total number of triangles.

Triangles:
1. <0, 8, 9>
2. <1, 2, 3>
3. <1, 5, 8>
4. <1, 5, 9>
5. <1, 8, 6>
6. <2, 1, 3>
7. <3, 6, 8>
8. <5, 4, 8>
9. <5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
