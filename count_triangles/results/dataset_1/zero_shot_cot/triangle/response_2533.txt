Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangles involving node 0: None, as it's only connected to node 9.
- Triangles involving node 1: None, as it's only connected to node 7.
- Triangles involving node 2: <2, 4, 7>.
- Triangles involving node 3: None, as it's only connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Triangles involving node 4: None, as it's only connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Triangles involving node 6: <2, 3, 9>.
- Triangles involving node 7: None, as it's only connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Triangles involving node 9: None, as it's only connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 6.

Therefore, there are <2, 4, 7> and <2, 3, 9> triangles in the graph.

Total number of triangles: [2]
