Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:
    
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6
        - Triangle <0, 1, 4>
        - Triangle <0, 1, 6>
        - Triangle <0, 4, 6>
    
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5
        - Triangle <0, 1, 3>
        - Triangle <1, 3, 6>
        - Triangle <1, 5, 6>
    
    - Node 2 is connected to node 9
    
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 6
        - Triangle <0, 3, 6>
    
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9
        - Triangle <0, 4, 7>
        - Triangle <0, 4, 9>
        - Triangle <4, 7, 9>
    
    - Node 5 is connected to node 1
    
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 8, and 9
        - Triangle <0, 6, 7>
        - Triangle <0, 6, 9>
        - Triangle <3, 6, 9>
        - Triangle <6, 7, 9>
    
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9
        - Triangle <4, 7, 8>
        - Triangle <7, 8, 9>
    
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9
    
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8
    
Counting the triangles and listing the unique ones, we have:
- Total number of triangles: [11]
- Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>
