Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected with edges in a way that they form a closed loop.

Checking node 0:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>

Checking node 1:
- No triangles formed with node 1.

Checking node 2:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 2, 5>

Checking node 3:
- No triangles formed with node 3.

Checking node 4:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <4, 7, 9>
- Triangle <4, 8, 6>

Checking node 5:
- No triangles formed with node 5.

Checking node 6:
- No triangles formed with node 6.

Checking node 7:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <4, 7, 9>

Checking node 8:
- Triangle <4, 8, 6>
- Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Checking node 9:
- Triangle <4, 7, 9>
- Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
