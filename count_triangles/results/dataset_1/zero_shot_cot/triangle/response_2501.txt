Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6.

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 1>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
6. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
7. Triangle <2, 3, 4>
8. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
9. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
10. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
11. Triangle <4, 9, 6>

So, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
