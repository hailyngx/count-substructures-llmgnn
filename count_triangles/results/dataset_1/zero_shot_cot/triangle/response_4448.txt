Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 2>
   - Triangle <0, 1, 3>
   
2. **Node 1**: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5.
   - Triangle <1, 0, 2>
   
3. **Node 2**: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6.
   - Triangle <2, 0, 1>
   - Triangle <2, 0, 3>
   
4. **Node 3**: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9.
   - Triangle <3, 0, 1>
   - Triangle <3, 0, 2>
   
5. **Node 5**: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7.
   
6. **Node 6**: Connected to nodes 2, 3.
   
7. **Node 7**: Connected to nodes 5, 9.
   
8. **Node 8**: Connected to node 3.
   
9. **Node 9**: Connected to nodes 3, 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is **6**.  
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <1, 0, 2>, <2, 0, 1>, <2, 0, 3>, <3, 0, 1>.  
So, the answer is **[6]**.
