Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's start by listing all the triangles in the given graph:

1. (0, 2, 4)
2. (0, 2, 8)
3. (1, 4, 5)
4. (2, 4, 5)
5. (2, 4, 6)
6. (2, 5, 1)
7. (4, 6, 9)
8. (6, 7, 9)
9. (8, 0, 2)
10. (8, 2, 4)

Next, let's count the total number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
