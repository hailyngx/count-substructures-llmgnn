Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges given. 

Let's list down the triangles:
1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 7, 8>
4. <0, 8, 5>
5. <3, 6, 8>
6. <3, 8, 9>
7. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
