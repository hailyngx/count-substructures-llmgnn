Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph information, here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is: [3]
