Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 3.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6.

Now, we will identify the triangles in the graph by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle 2: <2, 6, 9>
3. Triangle 3: <3, 6, 9>
4. Triangle 4: <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
