Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually adjacent to each other.

Let's start by listing all the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <2, 4, 8>
4. <2, 5, 8>
5. <3, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
