Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first identify all the triangles by checking every possible set of 3 nodes that are mutually connected to each other.

In the provided graph, the triangles are:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <2, 3, 4>
3. <0, 2, 4>
4. <0, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
