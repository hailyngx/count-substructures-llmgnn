Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the steps to find the triangles and the final count:

1. Look for nodes that form triangles by having all pairwise connections between them:
- Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 3, 7 form a triangle.
- Triangle 2: Nodes 6, 8, 9 form a triangle.

2. Since each triangle is counted 3 times (once for each node), the total number of triangles is:
2 triangles * 3 = 6 triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
