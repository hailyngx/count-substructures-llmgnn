Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes based on the given edges. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

Step 1: Identify the triangles using the given edges.
- Based on the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
  1. <0, 1, 3>
  2. <0, 2, 4>
  3. <0, 2, 8>
  4. <2, 5, 6>
  5. <2, 7, 8>
  6. <7, 8, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles.
- From the identified triangles, we have found 6 unique triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
