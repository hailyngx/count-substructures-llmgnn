Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 6
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 8
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 7, 8
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 8, 9
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 2
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 2
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 3
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 4

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
