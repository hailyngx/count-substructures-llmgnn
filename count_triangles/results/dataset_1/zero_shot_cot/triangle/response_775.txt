Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
8. Node 8 is connected to node 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle 2: <1, 2, 5>

Counting the total number of triangles inside brackets []: [2]
