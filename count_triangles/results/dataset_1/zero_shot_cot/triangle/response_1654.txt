Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the unique triangles first:

<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 8, 4>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 1, 8>
<4, 1, 2>
<4, 1, 5>
<4, 2, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 1>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 6, 5>
<5, 3, 8>
<5, 4, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 1, 4>
<6, 4, 5>
<7, 5, 9>
<8, 1, 4>
<8, 1, 3>
<8, 3, 5>
<8, 4, 1>
<8, 4, 9>
<8, 9, 7>
<9, 2, 4>
<9, 4, 8>
<9, 7, 5>
<9, 8, 4>

Now, we need to count the total number of triangles. So, the total number of triangles in this graph is [30].
