Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Finding all the triangles in the given graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
4. Triangle <2, 1, 6>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <4, 9, 7>
7. Triangle <4, 3, 8>
8. Triangle <9, 7, 2>

Total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
