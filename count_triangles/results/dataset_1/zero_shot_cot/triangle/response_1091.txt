Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, and <8, 9, 1>.
