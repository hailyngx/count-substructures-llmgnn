Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's find these triangles step-by-step:

1. For node 0:
   - Triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>

2. For node 1:
   - Triangles: No new triangles

3. For node 2:
   - Triangles: No new triangles

4. For node 3:
   - Triangles: <1, 3, 6>

5. For node 4:
   - Triangles: <1, 4, 2>

6. For node 5:
   - Triangles: No new triangles

7. For node 6:
   - Triangles: <2, 6, 8>

8. For node 7:
   - Triangles: No new triangles

9. For node 8:
   - Triangles: No new triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
