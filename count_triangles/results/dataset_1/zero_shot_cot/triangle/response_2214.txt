Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each set of three nodes to see if they form a triangle. A triangle is formed when there are edges connecting all three nodes in a cycle. Let's find all the triangles step-by-step:

1. Checking each set of three nodes:
   - (0, 1, 8): No triangle
   - (0, 1, 9): No triangle
   - (0, 8, 4): No triangle
   - (1, 9, 2): No triangle
   - (2, 3, 9): Triangle <2, 3, 9>
   - (2, 6, 7): No triangle
   - (2, 6, 9): No triangle
   - (2, 7, 4): No triangle
   - (2, 7, 9): No triangle
   - (3, 9, 2): Triangle <2, 3, 9>
   - (4, 5, 8): No triangle
   - (4, 7, 9): No triangle
   - (4, 8, 5): No triangle
   - (5, 6, 8): No triangle
   - (5, 8, 4): No triangle
   - (5, 9, 6): No triangle
   - (6, 7, 2): No triangle
   - (6, 9, 2): No triangle
   - (6, 9, 5): No triangle
   - (7, 9, 2): No triangle
   - (7, 9, 4): No triangle
   - (8, 0, 4): No triangle
   - (8, 4, 5): No triangle
   - (8, 5, 9): No triangle
   - (9, 1, 2): No triangle
   - (9, 2, 3): Triangle <2, 3, 9>
   - (9, 2, 6): No triangle
   - (9, 2, 7): No triangle
   - (9, 3, 2): Triangle <2, 3, 9>
   - (9, 4, 5): No triangle
   - (9, 4, 7): No triangle
   - (9, 5, 6): No triangle
   - (9, 5, 8): No triangle
   - (9, 6, 2): No triangle
   - (9, 6, 5): No triangle
   - (9, 7, 4): No triangle
   - (9, 7, 2): No triangle

2. Count of unique triangles found: [3]
3. Unique triangles: <2, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
