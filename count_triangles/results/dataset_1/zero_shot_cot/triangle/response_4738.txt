Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. We have a total of 10 nodes in the graph.
2. We will iterate through all possible combinations of 3 nodes to see if they form a triangle.
3. The triangles are formed by finding nodes that are connected to each other.

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the following triangles:
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<6, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
