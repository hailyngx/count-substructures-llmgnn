Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

To find the number of triangles, we need to look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <4, 5, 6>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
