Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by 3 connected nodes.

Calculating the number of triangles can be done using the given edges:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: 5, 6, 7, 8
2. Nodes connected to node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
3. Nodes connected to node 3: 2, 7
4. Nodes connected to node 4: 7
5. Nodes connected to node 5: 0, 2, 6
6. Nodes connected to node 6: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
7. Nodes connected to node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
8. Nodes connected to node 8: 0, 2, 6, 9
9. Nodes connected to node 9: 7, 8

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 5, 2>
- <0, 6, 2>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <7, 6, 9>
- <7, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
