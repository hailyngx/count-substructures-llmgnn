Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 4, 1>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <0, 5, 2>
5. <0, 5, 4>
6. <1, 2, 8>
7. <1, 4, 5>
8. <1, 4, 8>
9. <2, 5, 4>
10. <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
