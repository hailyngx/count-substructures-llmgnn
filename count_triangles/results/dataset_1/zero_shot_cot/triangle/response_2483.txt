Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
6. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
7. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
8. Triangle <4, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [8]
