Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given graph has the following edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to node 6.

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph. We will look for all possible triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <1, 4, 5>
6. <2, 4, 5>
7. <2, 4, 0>
8. <2, 7, 8>
9. <4, 5, 8>
10. <5, 8, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
