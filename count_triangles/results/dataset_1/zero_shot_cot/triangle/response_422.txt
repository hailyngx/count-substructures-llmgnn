Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph based on the given edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's list down the triangles that can be formed in this graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <3, 4, 7>
5. <3, 6, 7>
6. <1, 8, 9>
7. <5, 6, 7>
8. <6, 9, 1>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles by putting them inside brackets:

Total number of triangles: [8]
