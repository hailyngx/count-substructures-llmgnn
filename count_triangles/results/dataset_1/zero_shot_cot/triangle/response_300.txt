Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the triangles using the given edges:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 7>

Step 2: Count the number of triangles found:
- Total number of triangles: [2]
