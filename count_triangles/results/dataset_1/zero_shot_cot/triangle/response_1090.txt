Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we can see that node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9. This means there are edges (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 8), and (0, 9). Similarly, node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9. No triangle possible with node 0.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5. No triangle possible with node 1.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 8 and 9. No triangle possible with node 2.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9. No triangle possible with node 3.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7. Triangle <3, 4, 5> found.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8. No triangle possible with node 5.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 4. No triangle possible with node 6.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 4. No triangle possible with node 7.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 9. No triangle possible with node 8.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8. No triangle possible with node 9.

From the triangles found with nodes 4 and 5, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1]. The unique triangle found is <3, 4, 5>.
