Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by examining each possible triangle:

Possible Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <0, 4, 8>
5. <0, 4, 9>
6. <0, 8, 9>
7. <2, 3, 6>
8. <2, 3, 7>
9. <2, 6, 7>
10. <3, 6, 7>
11. <4, 7, 8>
Total number of triangles: [11]
