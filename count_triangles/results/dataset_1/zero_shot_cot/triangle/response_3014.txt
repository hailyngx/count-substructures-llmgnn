Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with nodes and edges to visualize it better:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 4), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 8)

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all sets of 3 nodes that are connected to each other. Let's start by listing the triangles we can find in this graph:

Triangles:
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 0, 1>
