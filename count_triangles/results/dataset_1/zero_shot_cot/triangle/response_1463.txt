Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by nodes that are interconnected by edges. Triangles are formed by three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Let's list out all the unique triangles found in this graph:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <2, 5, 8>
4. <2, 7, 9>
5. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
