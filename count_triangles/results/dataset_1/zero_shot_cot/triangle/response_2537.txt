Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can determine the number of triangles in the graph by finding all the possible closed loops of length 3. Here are the steps to calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Identify Triangles**: Triangles in the graph are loops of length 3. We need to find all the unique combinations of nodes that form closed loops by following the edges.

2. **Count Triangles**: Count the total number of triangles in the graph.

Let's go through the steps and find the total number of triangles in the given graph.
The total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, and <6, 9, 3>.
