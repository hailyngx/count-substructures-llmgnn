Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Here are the unique triangles in this graph:

1. <2, 3, 6>
2. <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
