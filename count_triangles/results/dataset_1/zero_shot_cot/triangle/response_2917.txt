Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected.

Here are the triangles found in this graph:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 5>
<8, 9, 6>
<8, 9, 1>

Count of triangles: [9]
