Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we'll look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the unique triangles found in this graph:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <1, 4, 5>
5. <1, 4, 6>
6. <1, 5, 6>
7. <2, 3, 7>
8. <3, 6, 9>
9. <7, 9, 2>
10. <7, 9, 6>
11. <9, 8, 0>
12. <9, 8, 7>

Total number of triangles: [12]
