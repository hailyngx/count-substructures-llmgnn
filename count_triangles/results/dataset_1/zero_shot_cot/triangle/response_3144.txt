Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected by edges (i.e., form a triangle).

Let's list out all the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <1, 2, 3>
4. <1, 3, 6>
5. <2, 3, 6>
6. <3, 8, 9>
7. <4, 8, 0>
8. <6, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
