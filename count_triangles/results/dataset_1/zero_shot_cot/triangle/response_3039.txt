Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Here, I will list the unique triangles found and then provide the total count of triangles at the end.

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 2>
<7, 9, 3>
<8, 9, 3>
<8, 9, 7>

Total number of triangles: [10]
