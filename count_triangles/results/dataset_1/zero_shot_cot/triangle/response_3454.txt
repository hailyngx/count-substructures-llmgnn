Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total number of triangles:
We can use the formula for counting triangles in a graph, which is:
\[ \text{{Total number of triangles}} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{v \in V} \text{{deg}}(v) (\text{{deg}}(v) - 1) (\text{{deg}}(v) - 2), \]
where \( V \) is the set of vertices and \( \text{{deg}}(v) \) is the degree of vertex \( v \).

2. Calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Degree of vertex 0 = 6
- Degree of vertex 1 = 2
- Degree of vertex 2 = 3
- Degree of vertex 3 = 6
- Degree of vertex 4 = 4
- Degree of vertex 5 = 3
- Degree of vertex 6 = 1
- Degree of vertex 7 = 4
- Degree of vertex 8 = 3
- Degree of vertex 9 = 3

3. Substitute the degrees into the formula:
\[ \text{{Total number of triangles}} = \frac{1}{6} \left(6(6)(5) + 2(1)(0) + 3(3)(1) + 6(6)(5) + 4(4)(3) + 3(3)(1) + 1(0)(-1) + 4(4)(3) + 3(3)(1) + 3(3)(1)\right) \]

4. Solve the equation:
\[ \text{{Total number of triangles}} = \frac{1}{6}(180 + 0 + 9 + 180 + 48 + 9 + 0 + 48 + 9 + 9) \]
\[ = \frac{1}{6} \times 492 \]
\[ = 82 \]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is 82.
