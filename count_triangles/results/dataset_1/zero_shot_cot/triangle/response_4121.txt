Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the steps to find the triangles:

1. Identify the triangles based on the given edges:
   - Nodes (0, 2, 8) form a triangle.
   - Nodes (2, 3, 8) form a triangle.
   - Nodes (3, 5, 8) form a triangle.

2. Calculate the total number of triangles:

<3 unique triangles found.>
[Total number of triangles: 3]
