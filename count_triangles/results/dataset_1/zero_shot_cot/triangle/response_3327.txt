Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Nodes 0, 1, and 3 form a triangle.

2. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Nodes 0, 3, and 9 form a triangle.

Moving to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.

3. Triangle <1, 0, 4>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Nodes 1, 0, and 4 form a triangle.

Moving to node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.

4. Triangle <3, 0, 4>
- Nodes 3, 0, and 4 form a triangle.

There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph: [4].
