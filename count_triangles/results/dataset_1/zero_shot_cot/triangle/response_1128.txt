Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for the combinations of three nodes that form closed loops of connections. In a triangle, each node is connected to the other two nodes, forming a total of three edges.

Here is the list of unique triangles found in the given graph:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
