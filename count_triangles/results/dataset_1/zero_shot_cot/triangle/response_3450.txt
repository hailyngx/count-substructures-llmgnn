Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes that are each connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step in counting the triangles:

1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 2, 8>
5. <1, 4, 7>
6. <2, 1, 8>
7. <3, 5, 9>
8. <4, 5, 7>
9. <5, 9, 3>
10. <5, 9, 4>
11. <6, 0, 9>
12. <7, 4, 9>
13. <7, 9, 3>
14. <7, 9, 5>

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [14].
