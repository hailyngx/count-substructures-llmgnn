Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph and the list of edges, we can analyze the triangles present in the graph. Let's list the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 3, 8>
4. <0, 3, 9>
5. <0, 4, 7>
6. <0, 7, 9>
7. <0, 8, 9>
8. <1, 3, 9>
9. <3, 7, 9>
10. <3, 8, 9>
11. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in this graph. So, the total number of triangles is [11].
