Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Write down the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges.

Node 0: 2, 4, 5
Node 1: 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 3, 9
Node 3: 2, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 8
Node 5: 0, 6
Node 6: 5, 9
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 1, 3, 4
Node 9: 2, 3, 6

Step 2: Count the number of triangles formed by checking nodes that have edges between them.

There are 5 triangles in this graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
