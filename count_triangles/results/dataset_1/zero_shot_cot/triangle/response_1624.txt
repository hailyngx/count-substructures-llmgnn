Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
   - Triangle 1: (0, 2, 9)

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
   - Triangle 2: (1, 2, 6)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 3, 6)

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
   - Triangle 4: (0, 1, 2)
   - Triangle 5: (1, 2, 5)

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
   - Triangle 6: (4, 6, 7)

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.

Adding up the triangles, we have found a total of 6 unique triangles. Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
