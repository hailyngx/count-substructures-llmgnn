Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. For each node, identify its neighbors based on the given edges:
   - Node 0: Neighbors are 1 and 3
   - Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 6, and 9
   - Node 2: Neighbors are 4, 5, 6, and 9
   - Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 5, and 8
   - Node 4: Neighbors are 2 and 9
   - Node 5: Neighbors are 2 and 3
   - Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 2, 7, and 9
   - Node 7: Neighbors are 6 and 8
   - Node 8: Neighbors are 3, 7, and 9
   - Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8

2. For each node, check if there are any triangles formed with its neighbors.
   - Node 0: No triangles
   - Node 1: Tringles: <1, 6, 9>
   - Node 2: Tringles: <2, 6, 9>
   - Node 3: No triangles
   - Node 4: No triangles
   - Node 5: No triangles
   - Node 6: Tringles: <6, 9, 1>
   - Node 7: No triangles
   - Node 8: No triangles
   - Node 9: Tringles: <9, 6, 1> and <9, 6, 2> and <9, 6, 8>

3. The total number of triangles found in the graph: **[5]**.
   
Unique triangles:
   - <1, 6, 9>
   - <2, 6, 9>
   - <9, 6, 1>
   - <9, 6, 2>
   - <9, 6, 8>
