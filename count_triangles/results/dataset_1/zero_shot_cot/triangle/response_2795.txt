Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other (form a triangle). Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

1. <0, 7, 9>
2. <1, 2, 5>
3. <5, 6, 7>
4. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
