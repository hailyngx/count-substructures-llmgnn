Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 6, 5>
4. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 7, 3>
6. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
7. Triangle <1, 7, 3>
8. Triangle <2, 1, 4>
9. Triangle <5, 6, 8>
10. Triangle <8, 7, 3>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. So, the number of triangles is [10].
