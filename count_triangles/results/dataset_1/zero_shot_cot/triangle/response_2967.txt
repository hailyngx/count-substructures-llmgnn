Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
   - <0, 2, 4>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
   - <0, 2, 4>
4. Node 3 is connected to node 0.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
