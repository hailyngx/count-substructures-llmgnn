Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We have the following edges:

- (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Let's list the possible triangles:

<0, 4, 5>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
