Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
By counting the number of triangles in the given graph, we can proceed step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 8.
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 9 and 3.
4. Node 3 does not form a triangle with any other nodes.
5. Nodes 5 and 6 form a triangle with each other and node 9.
6. Node 7 does not form a triangle with any other nodes.
7. Node 8 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5.
8. Node 9 forms a triangle with nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, and <2, 3, 9>.
