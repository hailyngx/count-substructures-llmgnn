Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

After analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <2, 3, 5>
3. <2, 3, 7>
4. <2, 5, 7>
5. <3, 5, 6>
6. <3, 5, 9>
7. <3, 6, 7>
8. <3, 7, 8>
9. <4, 5, 9>
10. <5, 6, 7>
11. <5, 7, 9>
12. <7, 8, 9>

There are 12 unique triangles, so the total number of triangles in this graph is [12].
