Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5> is formed.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
   - Triangle <1, 2, 6> is formed.
   - Triangle <1, 3, 6> is formed.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
   - Triangles <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9> are formed.
   - Triangles <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 9> are formed.
   - Triangle <6, 2, 7> is formed.
   - Triangle <7, 2, 8> is formed.
   - Triangle <8, 2, 9> is formed.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
   - Triangle <1, 3, 5> is formed.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
   - Triangle <4, 5, 6> is formed.
   - Triangle <4, 6, 8> is formed.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
   - Triangle <0, 5, 3> is formed.
   - Triangle <0, 5, 4> is formed.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9.
   - Triangle <1, 6, 2> is formed.
   - Triangle <4, 6, 9> is formed.

8. Node 7 is connected to node 2.
   - No triangle formed.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
   - Triangle <2, 8, 9> is formed.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
   - No new triangle formed.

Counting the unique triangles found, we get:
[12] triangles.
