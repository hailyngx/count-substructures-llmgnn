Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the triangles in the given graph:
1. Check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle.
2. A triangle is formed if each node is connected to the other two nodes in the triplet. 

Let's list the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <2, 7, 8>
4. <6, 8, 9>
5. <7, 8, 9>

Now, we count the total number of triangles: [5]
