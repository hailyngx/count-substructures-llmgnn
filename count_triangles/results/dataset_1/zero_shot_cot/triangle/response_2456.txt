Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we will identify the triangles present:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
4. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
6. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
7. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
8. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
9. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
10. Triangle <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. The answer to the problem is [10].
