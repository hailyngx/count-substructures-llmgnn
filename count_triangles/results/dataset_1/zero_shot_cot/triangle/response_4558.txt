Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
I will calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

Step 1: Find all triangles formed by the given edges:

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 1>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 5>
<6, 9, 7>
<9, 7, 0>

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [10]
