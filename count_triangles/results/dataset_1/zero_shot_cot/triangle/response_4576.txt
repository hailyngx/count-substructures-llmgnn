Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. We know that a triangle consists of 3 nodes connected by 3 edges.
2. We will look for triangles by examining each unique combination of 3 nodes.
3. We will check if there is an edge between each pair of nodes in the combination to confirm the triangle.
4. If all 3 pairs of nodes have edges between them, we will count it as a triangle.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<5, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
