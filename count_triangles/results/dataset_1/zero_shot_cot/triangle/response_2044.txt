Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Let's identify the triangles in the graph:
   - <0, 1, 7>
   - <0, 2, 5>
   - <0, 6, 9>
   - <1, 7, 8>
   - <2, 5, 8>
   - <6, 7, 9>

2. Count the total number of triangles: [6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
