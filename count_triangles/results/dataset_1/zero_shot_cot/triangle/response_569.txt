Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can iterate through all possible combinations of three nodes and check if they form a triangle by checking if there is an edge between each pair of nodes in the combination.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 9, 5>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the graph.
