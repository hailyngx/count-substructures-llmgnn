Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to check each possible triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:

<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
