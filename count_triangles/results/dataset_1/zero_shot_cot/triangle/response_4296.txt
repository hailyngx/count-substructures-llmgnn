Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes connected by edges to each other.

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>

Count of triangles: [2]
