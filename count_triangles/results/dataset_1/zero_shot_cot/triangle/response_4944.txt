Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for cycles of length 3. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes connected pairwise. Let's list the triangles that can be found in this graph:

1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 7, 9>
3. <1, 3, 4>
4. <1, 9, 2>
5. <3, 2, 9>
6. <3, 6, 4>
7. <3, 8, 9>
8. <4, 6, 5>
9. <5, 6, 7>
10. <5, 7, 9>
11. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [11].
