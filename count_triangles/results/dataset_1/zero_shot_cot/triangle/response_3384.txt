Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list out the triangles:

1. <1, 2, 9>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <4, 5, 8>

Count of triangles in brackets is [3].
