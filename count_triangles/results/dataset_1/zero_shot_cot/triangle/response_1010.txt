Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the triangles in the graph.
- To form a triangle, we need 3 nodes connected to each other.
- Reviewing the provided edges, we can see that the triangles in this graph are: (1, 5, 7) and (1, 8, 9).

Step 2: Count the number of triangles.
- There are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
