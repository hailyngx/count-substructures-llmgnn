Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's break it down and identify the triangles:
1. Possible triangles including node 0: None
2. Possible triangles including node 2: None
3. Possible triangles including node 3: None
4. Possible triangles including node 4: (2, 4, 8)
5. Possible triangles including node 5: None
6. Possible triangles including node 6: (0, 4, 6), (4, 5, 6), (4, 6, 8), (5, 6, 7)
7. Possible triangles including node 7: None
8. Possible triangles including node 8: None
9. Possible triangles including node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <2, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, and <5, 6, 7>.
