Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's calculate the number of triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 7, 9>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
