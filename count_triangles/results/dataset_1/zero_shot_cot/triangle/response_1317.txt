Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles step-by-step in the given graph:

1. Start by listing all the triangles in the graph:
  - Triangle 1: {1, 3, 4}
  - Triangle 2: {1, 3, 8}
  - Triangle 3: {1, 4, 8}
  
There are a total of 3 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
