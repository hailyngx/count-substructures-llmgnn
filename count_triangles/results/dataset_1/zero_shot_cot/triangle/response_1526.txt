Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

Let's start by listing out the triangles present in the graph:
1. <1, 4, 9>
2. <2, 3, 6>
3. <3, 5, 6>

Count of triangles in the graph: [3]
