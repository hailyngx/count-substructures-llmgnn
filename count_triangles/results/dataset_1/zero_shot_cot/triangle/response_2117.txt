Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.
2. List out the unique triangles found.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>.
