Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 0, 2>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 3>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 6>
6. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
7. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
