Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0) - No triangle.
2. Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 1), (5, 1), (9, 1) - No triangle.
3. Node 2: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1) - No triangle.
4. Node 3: (2, 3), (3, 2) - No triangle.
5. Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4) - <4, 5, 8>.
6. Node 5: (0, 5), (1, 5), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4) - No triangle.
7. Node 6: (0, 6), (6, 0), (6, 7), (7, 6) - No triangle.
8. Node 7: (6, 7), (7, 6), (7, 9), (9, 7) - No triangle.
9. Node 8: (4, 8), (8, 4) - No triangle.
10. Node 9: (1, 9), (4, 9), (7, 9), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 7) - No triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1]. The unique triangle found is <4, 5, 8>.
