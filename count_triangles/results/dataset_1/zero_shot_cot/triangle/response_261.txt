Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

From the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to all other nodes except node 8.

Now, let's determine the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangles involving node 0: None
2. Triangles involving node 1: (1, 6, 9)
3. Triangles involving node 2: None
4. Triangles involving node 3: None
5. Triangles involving node 4: None
6. Triangles involving node 5: None
7. Triangles involving node 6: None
8. Triangles involving node 7: None
9. Triangles involving node 8: None
10. Triangles involving node 9: (1, 6, 9), (1, 7, 9), (1, 8, 9), (2, 6, 9), (3, 5, 9), (3, 6, 9), (5, 6, 9)

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8], and the unique triangles found are <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>.
