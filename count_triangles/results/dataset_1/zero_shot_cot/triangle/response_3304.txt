Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we can look for every possible combination of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <1, 2, 4>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <7, 4, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
