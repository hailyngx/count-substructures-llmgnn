Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. 

The triangles in this graph are:
1. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
