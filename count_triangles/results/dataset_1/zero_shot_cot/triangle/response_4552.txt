Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node in the graph.

Node 0: 4 edges
Node 1: 1 edge
Node 2: 2 edges
Node 3: 1 edge
Node 4: 5 edges
Node 5: 2 edges
Node 6: 2 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 8: 3 edges
Node 9: 5 edges

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles in the graph.
For each edge (i, j), check how many common neighbors they have. If they have a common neighbor, then there's a triangle.

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 9, 6>
<7, 0, 9>
<8, 0, 9>

Total number of triangles: [12]
