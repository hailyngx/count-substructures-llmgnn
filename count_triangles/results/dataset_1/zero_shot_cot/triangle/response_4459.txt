Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Now let's count the number of triangles in this graph. A triangle is formed when there are three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will examine all possible combinations of three nodes to find the triangles:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <0, 3, 6>
5. <0, 3, 8>
6. <0, 3, 9>
7. <0, 5, 6>
8. <0, 5, 9>
9. <0, 6, 9>
10. <1, 4, 2>
11. <1, 4, 3>
12. <1, 7, 5>
13. <1, 9, 3>
14. <3, 4, 2>
15. <3, 4, 5>
16. <3, 4, 6>
17. <3, 5, 6>
18. <3, 5, 9>
19. <3, 6, 9>
20. <5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles = 20
Therefore, there are a total of [20] triangles in the given graph.
