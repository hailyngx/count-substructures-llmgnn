Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node for the given graph.

- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 3

Step 2: Identify triangles by finding nodes that are connected to each other.

Triangles:
- <1, 3, 5>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 8, 9>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
