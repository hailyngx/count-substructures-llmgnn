Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Starting with node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
   - Nodes 7 and 9 are not connected to each other through any other edge, so no triangle involving node 0.

2. Moving on to node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
   - Nodes 2, 4, and 5 form a triangle <1, 2, 4>.

3. Analyzing node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
   - Nodes 1, 5, and 6 form a triangle <1, 2, 5>.

4. Considering node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
   - Nodes 4 and 9 are not connected to each other through any other edge, so no triangle involving node 3.

5. Examining node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6.
   - Possible triangles involving node 4 are <1, 4, 5> and <4, 5, 6>.

6. Focusing on node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
   - Nodes 1, 2, and 4 form a triangle <1, 2, 5>.

7. Looking at node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
   - Nodes 2 and 4 are already part of the triangle <1, 2, 5>, so no new triangle involving node 6.

8. Moving to node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to node 0.
   - Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes that connect back to node 7, so no triangle involving node 7.

9. Finally, checking node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
   - Nodes 0 and 3 are not connected to each other through any other edge, so no triangle involving node 9.

In total, there are 3 unique triangles in this graph: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 5>, and <1, 4, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
