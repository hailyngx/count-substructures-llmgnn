Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can go through each possible triangle combination among the nodes and check if they form a triangle. Here's how you can do it:

1. Nodes involved in triangles: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
2. List of triangles:
   - <0, 1, 9>
   - <0, 2, 7>
   - <0, 6, 9>
   - <0, 7, 9>
   - <1, 2, 7>
   - <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are total [5] triangles in the given graph.
