Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes in the graph.

Given the edges, we can visualize the connections between nodes:

```
0 --- 3 --- 2 --- 6 --- 5 --- 7
|           |       |
9           4       8
```

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <3, 2, 6>
3. <3, 4, 9>
4. <3, 5, 6>
5. <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
