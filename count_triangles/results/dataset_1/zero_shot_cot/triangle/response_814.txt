Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:
- The total number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles formed by each possible set of three vertices.
- We will iterate over all possible sets of three vertices and check if there exists an edge between each pair of vertices in the set. If there is an edge between each pair of vertices in a set, then a triangle is formed.

After analyzing the given graph, the total number of triangles is [3]. There are three unique triangles found in the graph:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
