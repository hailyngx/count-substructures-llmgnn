Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the sets of three nodes that form a triangle by having edges between each pair of the three nodes. Let's follow these steps:

1. First, let's list all the triangles found in the graph:
   - <0, 1, 2>
   - <0, 1, 5>
   - <0, 2, 6>
   - <0, 2, 9>
   - <1, 5, 7>
   - <1, 9, 7>
   - <2, 6, 4>
   - <2, 6, 7>
   - <2, 9, 7>
   - <4, 6, 7>
   - <9, 8, 7>
   - <9, 1, 5>
   - <9, 1, 0>
   - <9, 3, 7>
   - <9, 3, 2>

2. Count the total number of triangles:
   There are 15 unique triangles listed above, so the total number of triangles is [15].
