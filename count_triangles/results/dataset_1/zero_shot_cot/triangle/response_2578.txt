Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every possible set of three nodes that form a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other by edges. Let's count the number of triangles step by step:

1. Possible triangles involving node 0:
   - (0, 1, 3) forms a triangle.
   - (0, 1, 5) forms a triangle.
   - (0, 3, 5) forms a triangle.
   - (0, 1, 9) forms a triangle.
   - (0, 5, 9) forms a triangle.

2. Possible triangles involving node 1:
   - (1, 0, 9) forms a triangle.

3. Possible triangles involving node 2:
   - None.

4. Possible triangles involving node 3:
   - (3, 0, 6) forms a triangle.

5. Possible triangles involving node 4:
   - (4, 2, 6) forms a triangle.
   - (4, 5, 6) forms a triangle.

6. Possible triangles involving node 5:
   - (5, 0, 4) forms a triangle.
   - (5, 0, 7) forms a triangle.
   - (5, 0, 8) forms a triangle.
   - (5, 4, 7) forms a triangle.
   - (5, 4, 8) forms a triangle.
   - (5, 7, 8) forms a triangle.

7. Possible triangles involving node 6:
   - (6, 2, 4) forms a triangle.

8. Possible triangles involving node 7:
   - None.

9. Possible triangles involving node 8:
   - None.

10. Possible triangles involving node 9:
   - None.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <3, 0, 6>, <4, 2, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 0, 4>, <5, 0, 7>, <5, 0, 8>, <5, 4, 7>, <5, 4, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 2, 4>.
