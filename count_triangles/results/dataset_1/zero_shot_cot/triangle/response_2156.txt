Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Check each possible triangle:
   
   - Triangle 1: (0, 9, 1)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 9, 4)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 9, 7)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 9, 4)
   - Triangle 5: (1, 9, 7)
   - Triangle 6: (2, 3, 6)
   - Triangle 7: (2, 3, 7)
   - Triangle 8: (3, 5, 8)
   - Triangle 9: (4, 5, 9)

2. Count the total number of triangles: [9]
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9], and the unique triangles found are <0, 9, 1>, <0, 9, 4>, <0, 9, 7>, <1, 9, 4>, <1, 9, 7>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, and <4, 5, 9>.
