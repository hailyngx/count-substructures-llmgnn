Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: First, let's write down all the triangles formed by the given edges:
(1, 4, 2), (1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 8), (1, 2, 9), (1, 6, 5), (1, 6, 9), (1, 5, 8), (1, 8, 3), (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 9), (3, 8, 5), (5, 6, 9)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles = 12
Unique triangles: <1, 4, 2>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 8, 3>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 8, 5>, <5, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
