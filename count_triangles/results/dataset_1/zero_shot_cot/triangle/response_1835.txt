Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the triangles in the given graph:
1. (0, 1, 4)
2. (0, 1, 7)
3. (0, 2, 5)
4. (0, 2, 8)
5. (1, 3, 5)
6. (1, 4, 6)
7. (5, 6, 8)
8. (5, 8, 9)

There are 8 triangles in total. Hence, the number of triangles in the graph is [8].
