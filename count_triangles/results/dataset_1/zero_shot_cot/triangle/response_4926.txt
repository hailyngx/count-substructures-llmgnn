Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, and <5, 8, 9>.
