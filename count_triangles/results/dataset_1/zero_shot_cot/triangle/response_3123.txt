Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step.

1. **Identify triangles**: Start by checking each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

2. **List of triangles**:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 6, 1>
   - Triangle 3: <2, 3, 5>
   - Triangle 4: <2, 3, 7>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 3, 8>
   - Triangle 6: <2, 5, 3>
   - Triangle 7: <4, 0, 5>
   - Triangle 8: <6, 0, 1>
   - Triangle 9: <6, 0, 4>
   - Triangle 10: <6, 0, 8>
   - Triangle 11: <6, 1, 8>
   - Triangle 12: <6, 8, 2>
   - Triangle 13: <6, 8, 3>
   - Triangle 14: <6, 8, 9>
   - Triangle 15: <7, 3, 5>

3. **Count the total number of triangles**: Counting the number of unique triangles found, we have found 15 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
