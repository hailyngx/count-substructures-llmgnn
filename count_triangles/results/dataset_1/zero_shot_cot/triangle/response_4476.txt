Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's carefully examine the given graph's connections:

The unique triangles in the graph are:
1. <1, 7, 8>
2. <1, 8, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
