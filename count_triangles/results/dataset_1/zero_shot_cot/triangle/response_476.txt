Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 3.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Now, let's find the triangles:

1. <1, 0, 7>
2. <1, 2, 3>
3. <1, 4, 8>

Count of triangles: [3]
