Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step:

1. Look for triangles involving nodes directly connected by edges:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 9>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 3, 9>
   - Triangle 3: <4, 5, 9>
   - Triangle 4: <6, 5, 3>
   - Triangle 5: <6, 7, 4>

2. Next, look for triangles involving nodes connected by indirect paths:
   - Triangle 6: <0, 4, 2>
   - Triangle 7: <1, 5, 6>
   - Triangle 8: <1, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 9: <3, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 10: <0, 9, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph.
