Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles we can find in this graph:
1. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
6. Triangle <4, 0, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 1, 2>
8. Triangle <6, 2, 5>
9. Triangle <7, 1, 3>
10. Triangle <7, 1, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in this graph.
