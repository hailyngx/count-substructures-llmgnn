Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of 3 nodes that are all interconnected by edges. Let's analyze the graph and identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes with their connected edges:
   - Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 5)
   - Node 1: (1, 0)
   - Node 2: (2, 6)
   - Node 3: (3, 7)
   - Node 4: (not connected to any other node)
   - Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 6)
   - Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 8)
   - Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 8)
   - Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9)
   - Node 9: (9, 8)

2. Possible triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
   - Triangle 2: <6, 5, 0>
   - Triangle 3: <6, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <6, 2, 8>
   - Triangle 5: <8, 9, 6>
   - Triangle 6: <8, 7, 3>
   - Triangle 7: <8, 7, 6>

3. Counting the total number of triangles: [7]

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
