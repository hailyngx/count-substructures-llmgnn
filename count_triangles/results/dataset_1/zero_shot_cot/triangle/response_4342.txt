Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visually represent the given graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 2), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 5), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the total number of triangles in the given graph:

[Total number of triangles: 6]
<0, 6, 2>
<5, 1, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
