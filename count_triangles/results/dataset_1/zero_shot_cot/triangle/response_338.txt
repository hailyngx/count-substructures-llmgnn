Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's first identify all the triangles by looking for nodes that are connected in the form of triangles.

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <4, 5, 8>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
