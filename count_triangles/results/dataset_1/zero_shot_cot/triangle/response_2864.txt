Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all possible triangles by checking each combination of 3 nodes connected by edges.
- Possible triangles: (0, 1, 7), (0, 1, 9), (0, 7, 9), (1, 2, 3), (3, 6, 9), (5, 7, 8), (7, 8, 9)
  
Step 2: Count the number of triangles present in the graph.
- Total Number of Triangles: [0]
