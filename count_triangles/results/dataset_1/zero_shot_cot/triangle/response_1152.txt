Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the given edges.

Let's start by listing all the triangles one by one:
1. (0, 3, 5)
2. (2, 6, 8)
3. (8, 9, 4)
4. (0, 3, 5)
5. (2, 6, 8)
6. (8, 9, 4)

Now, listing only the unique triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <2, 6, 8>
3. <8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
