Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4.
- Triangle 2: Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7.
- Triangle 3: Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8.

2. Count the total number of triangles: [3]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
