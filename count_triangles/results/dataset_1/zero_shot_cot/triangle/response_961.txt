Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph based on the given edges:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 2, 4>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <2, 3, 0>
5. <2, 5, 7>
6. <3, 8, 5>
7. <4, 7, 1>
8. <5, 8, 6>
  
There are a total of 8 triangles in the graph. Therefore, the answer is [8].
