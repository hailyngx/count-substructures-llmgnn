Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [8]. The unique triangles are <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 9, 8>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 1, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, and <6, 7, 9>.
