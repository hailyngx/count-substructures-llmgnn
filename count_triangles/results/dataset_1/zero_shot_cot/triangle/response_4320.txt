Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify all the triangles that exist. A triangle is formed by three nodes connected by edges to form a closed loop.

From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <2, 5, 8>
4. <2, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
