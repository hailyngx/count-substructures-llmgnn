Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Create an adjacency matrix from the given edges.

|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 4 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 9 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles in the graph.

Counting the number of triangles in the graph involves finding the number of paths of length 2 between all pairs of nodes.

By examining the adjacency matrix, you can see that the triangles in this graph are formed by the following unique node triplets (triangles):
1. <1, 3, 5>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
