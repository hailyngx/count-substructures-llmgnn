Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
By observing the given graph, we can write down each triangle present:

1. <0, 4, 1>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <0, 7, 2>
5. <0, 7, 6>
6. <1, 4, 8>
7. <1, 4, 9>
8. <1, 5, 9>
9. <2, 6, 7>
10. <4, 8, 9>
11. <7, 2, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
