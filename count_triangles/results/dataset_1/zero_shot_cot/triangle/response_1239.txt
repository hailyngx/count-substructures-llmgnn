Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles are <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
