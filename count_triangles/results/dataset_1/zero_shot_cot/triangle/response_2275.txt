Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We'll go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Identify the triangles using the given edges:
   - Triangle 1: (2, 3, 6)
   - Triangle 2: (2, 3, 8)
   - Triangle 3: (2, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 4: (2, 3, 9)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 6, 9)
   - Triangle 6: (2, 8, 9)
   - Triangle 7: (3, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 8: (3, 6, 9)
   - Triangle 9: (3, 8, 9)

2. Count the total number of unique triangles: 9

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9]. The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, and <3, 8, 9>.
