Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify Triangles
- A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes that are all connected to each other.
- In this case, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Step 2: List Unique Triangles
- After identifying the triangles, we list them once if they are unique.

Step 3: Count Total Number of Triangles
- Finally, we count the total number of unique triangles found.

Let's start by identifying the unique triangles in the given graph:

The triangles in the graph are:
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 8>

There are [2] triangles in total.
