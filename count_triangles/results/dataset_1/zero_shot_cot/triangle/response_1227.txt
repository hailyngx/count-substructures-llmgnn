Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three connected nodes. Let's begin by listing all the triangles:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <1, 2, 6>
4. <2, 5, 8>
5. <2, 5, 9>
6. <4, 5, 6>
7. <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
