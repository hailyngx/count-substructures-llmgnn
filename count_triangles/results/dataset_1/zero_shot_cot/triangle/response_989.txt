Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in this graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, forming a triangle <0, 3, 5>.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 4, forming a triangle <2, 3, 4>.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 8, forming a triangle <2, 6, 8>.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 2, forming a triangle <3, 5, 2>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 6, forming a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8 and 9, forming a triangle <6, 8, 9>.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9 and 6, forming a triangle <8, 9, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
