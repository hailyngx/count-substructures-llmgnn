Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, the total number of triangles can be counted by examining each possible triangle formed by three nodes.

By analyzing the edges given in the graph, the triangles found are as follows:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
