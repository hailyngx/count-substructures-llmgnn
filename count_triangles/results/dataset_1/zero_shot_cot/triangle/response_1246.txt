Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
4. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

After counting, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
