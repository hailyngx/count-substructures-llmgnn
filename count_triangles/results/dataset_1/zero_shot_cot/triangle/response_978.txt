Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a triangle.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph step by step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9. These connections form a triangle: <0, 1, 8>.
2. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 7, which already forms a triangle with edge 5-6-7.
3. Node 6 is also connected to nodes 9 and 5, forming another triangle: <5, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8> and <5, 6, 9>.
