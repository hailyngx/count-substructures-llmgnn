Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each possible triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges.

1. (0, 1, 2)
2. (0, 1, 4)
3. (0, 1, 7)
4. (0, 2, 7)
5. (0, 3, 4)
6. (0, 3, 6)
7. (0, 6, 7)

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 7>.
