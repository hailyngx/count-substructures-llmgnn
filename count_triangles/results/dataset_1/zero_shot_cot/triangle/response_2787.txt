Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Look for triangles formed by each node:
- For node 0: Triangles involving node 0 are (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 7), and (0, 4, 6).
- For node 1: Triangles involving node 1 are (1, 4, 8).
- For node 2: Triangles involving node 2 are (2, 3, 7) and (2, 5, 7).
- For node 3: Triangle involving node 3 is (0, 3, 7).
- For node 4: Triangle involving node 4 is (0, 4, 7).
- For node 5: No triangles with other nodes.
- For node 6: No triangles with other nodes.
- For node 7: No triangles with other nodes.
- For node 8: No triangles with other nodes.

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:
- Total number of triangles: 5

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 7>.
