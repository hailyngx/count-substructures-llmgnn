Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 38 edges, let's count the number of triangles:

Let's denote the nodes by their numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <1, 2, 5>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <2, 4, 5>
5. <2, 5, 7>
6. <4, 5, 6>
7. <5, 6, 9>
8. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
