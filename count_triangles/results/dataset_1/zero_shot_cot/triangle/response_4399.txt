Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will find the triangles in the graph. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes connected by edges to form a closed loop.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <1, 4, 7>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <1, 7, 9>
4. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
