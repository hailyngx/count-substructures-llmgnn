Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's identify the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 4, 5>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 4, 8>
3. Triangle 3: <1, 3, 7>
4. Triangle 4: <1, 4, 9>
5. Triangle 5: <2, 4, 6>

Thus, there are 5 triangles in total in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [5].
