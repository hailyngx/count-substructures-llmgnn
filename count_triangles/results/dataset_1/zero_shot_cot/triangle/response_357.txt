Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique cycles of length 3. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Start by listing all triangles by checking each possible set of 3 nodes:
   - Possible triangle sets: (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 8), (0, 2, 9), (0, 4, 5), (0, 5, 8), (0, 5, 9), (0, 7, 8), (0, 7, 9), (2, 4, 5), (2, 5, 9), (4, 5, 8), (5, 8, 9), (7, 8, 9)

2. Verify which of these sets actually form triangles based on the given edges:
   - There are 7 triangles: <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <5, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
