Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will determine the number of triangles and list the unique triangles present.

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that form a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles present in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
