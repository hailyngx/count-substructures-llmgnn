Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by 3 nodes connected to each other. We will analyze each node's connections to find all possible triangles. Let's start the process:

1. Node 0 is connected to Node 1.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6.
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, 9.
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 9.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 7.

Now, let's list down all the triangles that can be formed from the given connections:

1. <1, 2, 6>
2. <1, 3, 6>
3. <1, 2, 7>
4. <1, 7, 8>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <2, 6, 9>
7. <6, 7, 8>
8. <6, 7, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles [8] in the given graph.
