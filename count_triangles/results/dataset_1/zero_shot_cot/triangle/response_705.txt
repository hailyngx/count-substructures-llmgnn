Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's first identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <3, 5, 7>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles inside brackets []:
