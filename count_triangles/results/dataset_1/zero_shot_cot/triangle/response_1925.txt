Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
4. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
6. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
7. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
8. Triangle <3, 6, 9>
9. Triangle <4, 5, 7>
10. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
