Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Here are the steps to follow:
1. Identify all triangles formed by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.
3. List each unique triangle found.

Based on the given graph's edge information, we can identify the following unique triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 3: <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle 4: <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
