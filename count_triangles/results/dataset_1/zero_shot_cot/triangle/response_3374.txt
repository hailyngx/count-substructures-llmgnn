Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph based on the given edges:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 5>
4. Triangle <2, 0, 4>
5. Triangle <2, 0, 9>
6. Triangle <4, 0, 6>
7. Triangle <4, 0, 9>
8. Triangle <9, 2, 4>
9. Triangle <9, 2, 5>
10. Triangle <9, 3, 5>
11. Triangle <9, 3, 2>
12. Triangle <9, 3, 4>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [12]
