Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Considering the given graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's count the number of triangles in the graph.

A triangle in a graph occurs when three nodes are all connected to each other. We can calculate the total number of triangles by looking at each unique set of 3 nodes that form a complete subgraph.

Calculating the number of triangles:
- Starting from each node, we check if there are two other nodes that are connected to form a triangle.
- We iterate through all nodes and count the triangles formed.

Calculated number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>
