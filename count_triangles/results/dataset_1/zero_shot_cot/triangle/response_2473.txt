Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 3 and 7.
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0 and 7.
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9.
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's list the triangles:

1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <1, 7, 9>
5. <3, 7, 9>
6. <3, 4, 8>
7. <7, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
