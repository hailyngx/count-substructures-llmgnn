Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the triangles present in the graph by checking nodes that are connected to each other.

Triangular relationships:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles:
There are [6] triangles in total.
