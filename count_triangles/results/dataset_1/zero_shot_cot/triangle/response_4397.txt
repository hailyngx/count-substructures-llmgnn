Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
As there are 10 nodes in the graph, let's find the total number of triangles:

<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 9, 2>
<8, 0, 7>
<8, 0, 9>
<8, 3, 7>
<8, 9, 2>
<9, 0, 7>
<9, 0, 1>

Total number of triangles: [10]
