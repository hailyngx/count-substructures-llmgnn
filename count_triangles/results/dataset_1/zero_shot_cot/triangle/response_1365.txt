Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {0, 5}
2. Nodes connected to node 1: {1, 3}
3. Nodes connected to node 2: {2, 4, 9}
4. Nodes connected to node 3: {1, 6, 7, 8}
5. Nodes connected to node 4: {2, 5}
6. Nodes connected to node 5: {0, 4, 7, 9}
7. Nodes connected to node 6: {3, 7}
8. Nodes connected to node 7: {3, 5, 6}
9. Nodes connected to node 8: {3}
10. Nodes connected to node 9: {2, 5}

Now, let's look for triangles:
- <0, 5, 4>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <3, 6, 7>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
