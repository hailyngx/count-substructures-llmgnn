Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

Let's list the unique triangles found in this graph step-by-step and then count the total number of triangles at the end.

1. Possible triangles involving node 0:
   - <0, 1, 4>
   - <0, 1, 5>

2. Possible triangles involving node 1:
   - <0, 1, 5>
   - <1, 2, 6>
   - <1, 7, 9>

3. Possible triangles involving node 2:
   - No triangles involving node 2.

4. Possible triangles involving node 3:
   - No triangles involving node 3.

5. Possible triangles involving node 4:
   - No triangles involving node 4.

6. Possible triangles involving node 5:
   - No triangles involving node 5.

7. Possible triangles involving node 6:
   - No triangles involving node 6.

8. Possible triangles involving node 7:
   - <1, 7, 9>

9. Possible triangles involving node 8:
   - No triangles involving node 8.

10. Possible triangles involving node 9:
   - <1, 7, 9>

Counting the unique triangles listed above:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
