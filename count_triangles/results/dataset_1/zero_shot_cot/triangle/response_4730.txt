Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all the triangles consisting of three nodes that are connected in a closed loop.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<2, 4, 8>
