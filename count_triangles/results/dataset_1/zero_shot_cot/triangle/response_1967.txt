Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be counted by looking at every combination of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step in counting the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: 4, 8, 9
   - Triangle <0, 4, 8>
   - Triangle <0, 4, 9>
   - Triangle <0, 8, 9>

2. Nodes connected to node 1: 3, 7
   - No triangles formed with node 1.

3. Nodes connected to node 2: 5, 7, 9
   - No triangles formed with node 2.

4. Nodes connected to node 3: 1, 5, 8
   - Triangle <1, 3, 5>

5. Nodes connected to node 4: 0, 6
   - No triangles formed with node 4.

6. Nodes connected to node 5: 2, 3, 8, 9
   - No new triangles formed with node 5.

7. Nodes connected to node 6: 4, 8
   - No triangles formed with node 6.

8. Nodes connected to node 7: 1, 2, 8
   - No new triangles formed with node 7.

9. Nodes connected to node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7
   - Triangle <0, 3, 8>
   - Triangle <0, 5, 8>
   - Triangle <0, 8, 6>
   - Triangle <3, 5, 8>
   - Triangle <8, 5, 6>
   - Triangle <8, 6, 7>

10. Nodes connected to node 9: 0, 2, 5
   - No triangles formed with node 9.

Adding up all the unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 8, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <8, 5, 6>, <8, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
