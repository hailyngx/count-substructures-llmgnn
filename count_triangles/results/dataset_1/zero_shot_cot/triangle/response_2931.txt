Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can go through each possible triangle formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other directly.

Let's list down the triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 8, 9>
2. <1, 5, 6>
3. <2, 7, 8>
4. <3, 6, 7>
5. <4, 6, 8>
6. <8, 9, 1>

So, there are [6] triangles in total in the given graph.
