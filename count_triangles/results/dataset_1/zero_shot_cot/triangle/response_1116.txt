Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Count the total number of triangles in the graph.
    To find the number of triangles in a graph, we need to count all possible unique triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

Step 2: Find triangles involving Node 0.
    Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
    The triangles involving Node 0 are: <0, 4, 5> and <0, 4, 6>.

Step 3: Find triangles involving Node 1.
    Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
    No triangles involving Node 1 are formed in this graph.

Step 4: Find triangles involving Node 2.
    Node 2 is connected to Node 1.
    No triangles involving Node 2 are formed in this graph.

Step 5: Find triangles involving Node 3.
    Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
    No triangles involving Node 3 are formed in this graph.

Step 6: Find triangles involving Node 4.
    Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9.
    The triangles involving Node 4 are: <0, 4, 6>.

Step 7: Find triangles involving Node 5.
    Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7.
    The triangles involving Node 5 are: <0, 5, 6>.

Step 8: Find triangles involving Node 6.
    Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8.
    No new triangles involving Node 6 are formed in this graph.

Step 9: Find triangles involving Node 7.
    Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
    No triangles involving Node 7 are formed in this graph.

Step 10: Find triangles involving Node 8.
    Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
    No triangles involving Node 8 are formed in this graph.

Step 11: Find triangles involving Node 9.
    Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
    No triangles involving Node 9 are formed in this graph.

Total number of triangles in the graph: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 5> <0, 4, 6>
