Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all the sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. In other words, we are looking for cycles of length 3 (triangles).

Let's go through the graph and identify the triangles:
1. <0, 6, 7>
2. <0, 6, 8>
3. <0, 7, 8>
4. <1, 5, 4>
5. <2, 3, 4>
6. <2, 4, 8>
7. <5, 4, 8>
8. <0, 1, 8> 

There are 8 unique triangles in total.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
