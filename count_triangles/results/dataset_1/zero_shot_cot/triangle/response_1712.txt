Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list out the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <1, 0, 4>
5. <1, 4, 5>
6. <1, 4, 6>
7. <2, 1, 3>
8. <4, 0, 5>
9. <4, 0, 6>
10. <4, 1, 5>
11. <4, 1, 6>
12. <4, 5, 0>
13. <4, 6, 0>
14. <5, 0, 4>
15. <6, 0, 4>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [15]
