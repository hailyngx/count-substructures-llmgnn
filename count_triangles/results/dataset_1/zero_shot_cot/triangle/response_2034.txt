Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first identify all the unique triangles present in the graph and then count them.

The unique triangles in the given graph are:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <1, 3, 6>
3. <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
