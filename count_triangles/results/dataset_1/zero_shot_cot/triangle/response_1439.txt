Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges to form a closed loop.

Let's identify the unique triangles first:

1. Triangle 1: <1, 6, 9>
2. Triangle 2: <2, 5, 6>
3. Triangle 3: <4, 5, 6>
4. Triangle 4: <4, 6, 7>
5. Triangle 5: <5, 6, 8>
6. Triangle 6: <5, 6, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles inside brackets []: [6].
