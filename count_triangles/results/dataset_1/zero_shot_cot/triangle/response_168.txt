Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of closed loops of length 3, where each loop is essentially a triangle. Here's how you can go about finding the triangles:

1. Identify all triangles in the given graph:
    - Since our graph has 10 nodes, let's go through each combination of nodes to see if there exists an edge between every pair:
    - Triangles:
        - <0, 5, 2>
        - <0, 5, 9>
        - <0, 7, 4>
        - <0, 7, 6>
        - <0, 7, 8>
        - <0, 8, 6>
        - <0, 8, 7>
        - <1, 3, 4>
        - <2, 5, 9>
        - <3, 1, 4>
        - <3, 4, 7>
        - <3, 4, 9>
        - <4, 7, 6>
        - <5, 0, 2>
        - <5, 0, 9>
        - <5, 2, 6>
        - <5, 2, 9>
        - <5, 9, 3>
        - <5, 9, 8>
        - <6, 2, 7>
        - <6, 2, 8>
        - <6, 7, 8>
        - <6, 8, 0>
        - <7, 0, 4>
        - <7, 0, 6>
        - <7, 0, 8>
        - <7, 4, 6>
        - <7, 6, 8>
        - <8, 0, 6>
        - <8, 0, 7>
        - <8, 0, 9>
        - <8, 6, 2>
        - <8, 6, 7>
        - <8, 6, 9>
        - <8, 7, 6>
        - <8, 9, 3>
        - <8, 9, 5>
        - <9, 3, 4>
        - <9, 5, 0>
        - <9, 5, 2>
        - <9, 5, 8>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:
    There are 39 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [39].
