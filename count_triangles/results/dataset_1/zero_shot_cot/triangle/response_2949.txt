Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: 3, 4, 7, 8
2. Nodes connected to node 1: 5, 6
3. Nodes connected to node 2: 7
4. Nodes connected to node 3: 0, 7
5. Nodes connected to node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8
6. Nodes connected to node 5: 1, 6
7. Nodes connected to node 6: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
8. Nodes connected to node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8
9. Nodes connected to node 8: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
10. Nodes connected to node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle 2: <0, 6, 4>
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 8>
- Triangle 4: <4, 6, 8>

Count of triangles: [4]
