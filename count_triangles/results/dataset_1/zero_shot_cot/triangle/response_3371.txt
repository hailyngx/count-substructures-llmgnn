Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges and count them.

By visually examining the given graph and considering the defined edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <4, 6, 7>
5. <4, 8, 9>
6. <3, 4, 9>

Count of triangles: [6]
