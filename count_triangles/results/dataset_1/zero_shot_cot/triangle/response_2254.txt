Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's analyze the given graph to identify the triangles.

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Triangles:
1. <4, 0, 5>
2. <4, 5, 9>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <4, 9, 5>

Total number of triangles: [4]
