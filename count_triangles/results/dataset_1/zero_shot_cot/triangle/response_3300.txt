Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Starting with node 1, we see that node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 9. Nodes 2 and 9 are connected to nodes 6 and 7. Nodes 3 and 4 are only connected to each other. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and itself.

Let's find the triangles present in this graph:
1. Node 1, 6, and 7 form a triangle.
2. Node 2, 6, and 7 form a triangle.
3. Node 2, 7, and 9 form a triangle.
4. Node 3, 4, and 5 form a triangle.
5. Node 5, 7, and 9 form a triangle.

From this, we find that there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph: [5].
