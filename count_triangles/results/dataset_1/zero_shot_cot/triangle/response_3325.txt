Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when there are three nodes all connected to each other.

Looking at the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.

Now, let's count the number of triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 2: <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle 3: <3, 6, 7>

There are 3 triangles present in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
