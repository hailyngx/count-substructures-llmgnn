Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each possible triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges. Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 7, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 4>
4. Triangle <0, 9, 5>

Hence, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
