Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <0, 7, 5>
5. <3, 4, 8>
6. <3, 5, 7>
7. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
