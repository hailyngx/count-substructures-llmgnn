Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's find them step by step:

1. Triangle involving node 0:
   - (0, 5), (0, 6), (5, 6) -> Triangle <0, 5, 6>

2. Triangle involving node 1:
   No triangles with node 1.

3. Triangle involving node 2:
   No triangles with node 2.

4. Triangle involving node 3:
   No triangles with node 3.

5. Triangle involving node 4:
   No triangles with node 4.

6. Triangle involving node 5:
   No additional triangles with node 5.

7. Triangle involving node 6:
   No additional triangles with node 6.

8. Triangle involving node 7:
   No additional triangles with node 7.

9. Triangle involving node 8:
   - (0, 8), (3, 8), (0, 3) -> Triangle <0, 3, 8>

10. Triangle involving node 9:
   - (0, 9), (7, 9), (0, 7) -> Triangle <0, 7, 9>
   - (0, 9), (8, 9), (0, 8) -> Triangle <0, 8, 9>

Counting the triangles found above, we have identified 3 unique triangles: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, and <0, 7, 9>. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
