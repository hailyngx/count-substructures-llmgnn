Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <1, 2, 9>
5. <1, 5, 9>
6. <2, 8, 9>
7. <3, 4, 6>
8. <3, 4, 9>
9. <3, 6, 9>
10. <3, 8, 9>
11. <9, 7, 3>
12. <9, 7, 8>

There are a total of 12 triangles in the graph. So, the answer is [12].
