Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges provided. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected with edges.

1. Starting with node 0:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 3>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 3, 7>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 7, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 8, 9>

2. Moving to node 1:
   - No new triangles formed.

3. Examining node 2 and the connected nodes:
   - Triangle 5: <2, 0, 3>
   - Triangle 6: <2, 0, 4>
   - Triangle 7: <2, 3, 4>

4. Checking node 3 and its connections:
   - No new triangles formed.

5. Analyzing node 4:
   - Triangle 8: <4, 1, 8>

6. Exploring node 5:
   - No new triangles formed.

7. Moving on to node 6:
   - No new triangles formed.

8. Examining node 7 and its connections:
   - No new triangles formed.

9. Checking node 8 and its connections:
   - Triangle 9: <8, 1, 9>

10. Finally, focusing on node 9:
    - No new triangles formed.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
