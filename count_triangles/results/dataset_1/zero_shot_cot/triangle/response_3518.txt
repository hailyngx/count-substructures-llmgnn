Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:  

1. Look for nodes that form triangles together based on the provided edges.
2. Count the number of unique triangles found.

The triangles in this graph are:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<2, 4, 6>  
<2, 4, 8>  

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
