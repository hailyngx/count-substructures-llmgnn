Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
6. Triangle <4, 6, 9>
7. Triangle <5, 7, 9>
8. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
9. Triangle <2, 1, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
