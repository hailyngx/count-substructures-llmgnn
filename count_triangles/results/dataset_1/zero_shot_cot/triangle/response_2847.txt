Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming triangles. Let's list out the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangles involving Node 0:
   - <0, 2, 3>
   - <0, 4, 1>
   - <0, 7, 1>

2. Triangles involving Node 1:
   - <1, 4, 9>
   - <1, 7, 6>
   - <1, 8, 3>

3. Triangles involving Node 2:
   - <2, 0, 3>

4. Triangles involving Node 3:
   - <3, 8, 6>
   - <3, 9, 4>

5. Triangles involving Node 4:
   - <4, 9, 1>

6. Triangles involving Node 6:
   - <6, 7, 1>
   - <6, 8, 1>
   - <6, 9, 1>

7. Triangles involving Node 7:
   - <7, 1, 8>

8. Triangles involving Node 8:
   - <8, 3, 9>

9. Triangles involving Node 9:
   - <9, 6, 7>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total number of triangles = 13

Therefore, the answer is: [13]
