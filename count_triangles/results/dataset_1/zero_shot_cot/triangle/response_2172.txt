Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can analyze the connections between nodes.

Let's list the triangles one by one:

1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <4, 3, 8>

The total number of triangles is [2].
