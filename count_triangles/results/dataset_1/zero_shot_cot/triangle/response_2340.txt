Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can identify the triangles present in the graph. Let's list them step by step.

1. Triangle with nodes 1, 6, and 7: (1, 6), (6, 7), (7, 1)
2. Triangle with nodes 1, 3, and 6: (1, 3), (3, 6), (6, 1)
3. Triangle with nodes 1, 7, and 9: (1, 7), (7, 9), (9, 1)
4. Triangle with nodes 1, 6, and 9: (1, 6), (6, 9), (9, 1)
5. Triangle with nodes 3, 5, and 6: (3, 5), (5, 6), (6, 3)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5]. The unique triangles are <1, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, and <3, 5, 6>. Please note that each triangle is listed only once.
