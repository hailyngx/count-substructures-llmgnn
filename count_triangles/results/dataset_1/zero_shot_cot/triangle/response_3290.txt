Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify triangles by finding nodes that are connected to each other in a triangular way.

From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 4)
- Triangle 2: (1, 4, 6)
- Triangle 3: (1, 4, 7)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.

There are a total of 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, and <1, 4, 7>.
