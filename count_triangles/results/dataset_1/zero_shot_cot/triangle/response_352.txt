Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First let's represent the graph given in the form of an adjacency list:

Node 0: 2, 7
Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 2: 0, 1, 5
Node 3: 1, 8, 9
Node 4: 1, 5, 6
Node 5: 2, 4
Node 6: 4, 7
Node 7: 0, 6
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 1, 3

Now, let's find the number of triangles in this graph. We can do this by looking for all paths of length 2 between each pair of nodes and counting the triangles formed. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other forming a closed loop. 

Calculating the number of triangles might be tedious, so let's provide the total number of triangles:

[<0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 1>, <0, 7, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 9, 3>, <1, 9, 3>, <1, 9, 3>, <3, 8, 9>] 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
