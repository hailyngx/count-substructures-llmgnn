Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles we find:
1. <1, 7, 9>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <2, 3, 5>
4. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
