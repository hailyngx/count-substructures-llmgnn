Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the given graph:

1. From node 0: (0, 6, 4) <0, 6, 4>
2. From node 1: No triangles can be formed.
3. From node 3: (3, 5, 7) <3, 5, 7>
                  (3, 5, 9) <3, 5, 9>
                  (3, 6, 0) <3, 6, 0>
                  (3, 6, 4) <3, 6, 4>
                  (3, 7, 0) <3, 7, 0>
                  (3, 7, 4) <3, 7, 4>
                  (3, 8, 1) <3, 8, 1>
                  (3, 8, 4) <3, 8, 4>
                  (3, 9, 7) <3, 9, 7>
4. From node 4: No triangles can be formed.
5. From node 5: (5, 1, 6) <5, 1, 6>
                  (5, 1, 8) <5, 1, 8>
                  (5, 3, 6) <5, 3, 6>
6. From node 7: (7, 0, 6) <7, 0, 6>
                  (7, 3, 5) <7, 3, 5>
                  (7, 3, 9) <7, 3, 9>
                  (7, 4, 6) <7, 4, 6>
                  (7, 9, 3) <7, 9, 3>
7. From node 8: No triangles can be formed.
8. From node 9: (9, 3, 5) <9, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
