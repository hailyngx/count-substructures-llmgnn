Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <1, 3, 9>
2. <3, 4, 5>
3. <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
