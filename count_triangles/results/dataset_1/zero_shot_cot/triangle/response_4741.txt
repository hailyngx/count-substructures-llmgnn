Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.

Now, let's list the unique triangles in this graph:

1. <1, 4, 6>
2. <1, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
