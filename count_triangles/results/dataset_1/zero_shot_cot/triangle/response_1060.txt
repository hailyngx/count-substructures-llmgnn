Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 6. Thus, the triangle <0, 1, 6> is formed.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. We find the following triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 7>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5. No additional triangles are formed.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7. Thus, the triangle <1, 3, 7> is formed.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7. No additional triangles are formed.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 6. No additional triangles are formed.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9. We find the following triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8. We find the following triangles: <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <6, 7, 8>.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 7. No additional triangles are formed.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 6. No additional triangles are formed.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, and <6, 7, 8>.
