Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 7, 9>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <7, 9, 2>

Counting the unique triangles, we find that there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
