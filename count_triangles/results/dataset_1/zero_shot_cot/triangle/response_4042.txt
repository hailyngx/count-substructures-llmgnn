Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first identify the triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Then we will count the unique triangles.

1. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 2, 9>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <3, 6, 9>
6. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
7. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
