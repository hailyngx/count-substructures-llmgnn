Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 6>
4. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
6. Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
