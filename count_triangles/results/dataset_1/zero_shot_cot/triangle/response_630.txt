Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's follow these steps:

1. Look for each node that has two edges connected to it.
2. Find if there is a third node that is connected to both of the previous nodes.
3. Once you find such a set of three nodes, you have a triangle.

Let's go through the graph now:
- Node 0 has edges to nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 has edges to nodes 0, 3, and 8. Thus, we have found a triangle <0, 4, 8>.
- Node 5 has edges to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 has edges to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9. There are two triangles here: <0, 8, 4> and <0, 8, 5>.
- Node 2 has edges to nodes 3, 7, and 8.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
