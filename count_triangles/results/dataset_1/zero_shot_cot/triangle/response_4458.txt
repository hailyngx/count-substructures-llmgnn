Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will go step-by-step to identify these triangles:

1. Check each possible set of three nodes:
   - Let's check if nodes 0, 3, and 7 form a triangle. In this case, nodes 0, 3, and 7 are connected to each other forming a triangle. So, the triangle <0, 3, 7> is found.

2. Count the total number of triangles found: 
   - We found one triangle: <0, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
