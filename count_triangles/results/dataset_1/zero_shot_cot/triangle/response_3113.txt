Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. **Identifying Triangles**: A triangle in a graph is formed by 3 nodes interconnected by edges. We will look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

2. **Possible Triangles**:
   
   - <0, 1, 9>
   - <1, 3, 6>
   - <1, 5, 9>
   - <2, 7, 9>
   - <3, 4, 6>
   - <3, 6, 8>
   - <7, 6, 1>
   - <8, 2, 3>
   
3. **Total Number of Triangles**: [8]
