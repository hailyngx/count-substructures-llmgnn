Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles by looking for nodes that are interconnected. Let's list the triangles step by step and then count the total number of triangles.

1. Potential triangles with node 0:
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <0, 4, 9>

2. Potential triangles with node 1:
   No triangles involving node 1.

3. Potential triangles with node 2:
   No new triangles involving node 2.

4. Potential triangles with node 3:
   - <1, 3, 4>

5. Potential triangles with node 4:
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <0, 4, 9>
   - <3, 4, 5>
   - <4, 5, 6>
   
6. Potential triangles with node 5:
   - <3, 4, 5>
   - <4, 5, 6>

7. Potential triangles with node 6:
   - <4, 5, 6>

8. Potential triangles with node 9:
   - <0, 4, 9>

Now let's count the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]
