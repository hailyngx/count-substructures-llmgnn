Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Here are the steps to count the triangles:

1. Identify the triangles:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 9>

2. Calculate the number of triangles: 
    [8] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 8.
