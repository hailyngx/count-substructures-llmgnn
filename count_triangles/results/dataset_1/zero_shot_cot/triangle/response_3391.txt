Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9. So, the triangles involving node 0 are: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 8, 9>.
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 6: <1, 3, 6>.
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 7: <2, 4, 7>.
4. Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 0, 1, and 4: <0, 1, 3>.
5. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 0, 2, and 9: <0, 2, 4>.
6. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 8: <1, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
