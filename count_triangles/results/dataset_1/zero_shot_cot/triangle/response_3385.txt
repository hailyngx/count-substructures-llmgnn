Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can search for all possible triangles by examining each possible combination of three nodes.

Let's start by listing all the unique triangles found in this graph:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 6>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [7]
