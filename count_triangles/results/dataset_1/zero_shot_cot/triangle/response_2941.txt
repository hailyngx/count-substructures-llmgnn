Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.

Let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <1, 2, 5>
3. <2, 3, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
