Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. Here are the steps to count the triangles:

1. For each edge in the graph, check if there is a path of length 2 (i.e., triangle formation) between the two nodes connected by the edge.
2. Count the total number of triangles formed by the edges of the given graph.

Let's go ahead and count the number of triangles:

1. Triangles:
   - <0, 3, 5>
   - <0, 3, 9>
   - <0, 5, 9>
   - <0, 6, 9>
   - <1, 2, 4>
   - <1, 2, 8>
   - <2, 1, 7>
   - <2, 1, 4>
   - <2, 1, 7>
   - <2, 1, 7>
   - <2, 8, 6>
   - <3, 5, 9>
   - <3, 7, 1>
   - <3, 7, 1>
   - <3, 7, 1>
   - <3, 9, 5>
   - <3, 9, 5>
   - <4, 1, 8>
   - <4, 8, 6>
   - <5, 3, 9>
   - <5, 9, 0>
   - <5, 9, 3>
   - <6, 0, 9>
   - <6, 8, 2>
   - <6, 8, 4>
   - <6, 9, 0>
   - <7, 1, 3>
   - <8, 2, 6>
   - <9, 0, 3>
   - <9, 0, 5>
   - <9, 2, 3>
   - <9, 2, 5>
   - <9, 3, 5>
   - <9, 3, 7>
   - <9, 5, 0>
   - <9, 5, 3>
   - <9, 6, 0>
   - <9, 6, 8>

2. Total number of triangles: [36]
