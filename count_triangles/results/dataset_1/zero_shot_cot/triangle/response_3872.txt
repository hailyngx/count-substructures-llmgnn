Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in an adjacency list format for better visualization:

0: [3, 4, 6, 7]
1: [5, 7]
2: [5, 9]
3: [0, 6, 9]
4: [0]
5: [1, 2]
6: [0, 3, 7, 9]
7: [0, 1, 6]
8: [9]
9: [2, 3, 6, 8]

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
