Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all possible sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. Let's follow these steps to calculate the total number of triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 7. Let's look for triangles involving node 0:
    - (0, 7) -> Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
    - So, the triangle <0, 7, 1> exists.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7. Let's look for triangles involving node 1:
    - (1, 4) -> Node 4 is connected to nodes 9.
    - (1, 6) -> Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
    - (1, 7) -> Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
    - So, the triangles <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 0>, and <1, 7, 2> exist.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7. Let's look for triangles involving node 2:
    - (2, 3) -> Node 3 is connected to node 5.
    - (2, 6) -> Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
    - (2, 7) -> Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1.
    - So, the triangles <2, 3, 5>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 0>, and <2, 7, 1> exist.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5. Let's look for triangles involving node 3:
    - (3, 5) -> Node 5 is connected to node 2.
    - So, the triangle <3, 2, 5> exists.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 9. Let's look for triangles involving node 4:
    - (4, 9) -> Node 9 is connected to node 6.
    - So, the triangle <4, 1, 9> exists.

6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, and 9. Let's look for triangles involving node 6:
    - (6, 1) -> Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7.
    - (6, 2) -> Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 7.
    - (6, 8) -> Node 8 is not involved in any triangles.
    - (6, 9) -> Node 9 is connected to node 4.
    - So, the triangles <6, 1, 4>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 2, 3>, and <6, 9, 4> exist.

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. Let's look for triangles involving node 7:
    - (7, 0) -> Node 0 is connected to node 1.
    - (7, 1) -> Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6.
    - (7, 2) -> Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6.
    - So, the triangle <7, 0, 1>, <7, 1, 4>, <7, 1, 6>, <7, 2, 3>, and <7, 2, 6> exist.

8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 6. Let's look for triangles involving node 9:
    - (9, 4) -> Node 4 is connected to node 1.
    - (9, 6) -> Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8.
    - So, the triangle <9, 4, 1>, <9, 6, 1>, <9, 6, 2> exists.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
