Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles and the unique triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Check each unique combination of three nodes to see if they form a triangle by having edges between all possible pairs of the three nodes.
2. Count the total number of triangles found.

Let's go ahead and identify the triangles:

1. <0, 7, 9>
2. <2, 8, 9>
3. <2, 9, 3>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <9, 7, 0>
6. <9, 4, 3>
7. <9, 8, 2>
8. <9, 0, 7>

Therefore, there are 8 unique triangles in the given graph. Hence, the total number of triangles is [8].
