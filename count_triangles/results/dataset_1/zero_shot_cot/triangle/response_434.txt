Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Identify all triangles based on the given edges:
   - (0, 5, 8)
   - (2, 3, 9)
   - (3, 6, 7)
   - (6, 7, 9)
   - (0, 6, 8)

2. Count the number of unique triangles:
   - <0, 5, 8>
   - <2, 3, 9>
   - <3, 6, 7>
   - <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
