Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 6)
- Triangle 2: (1, 7, 8)
- Triangle 3: (1, 8, 9)
- Triangle 4: (1, 3, 9)
- Triangle 5: (2, 3, 6)

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles:
