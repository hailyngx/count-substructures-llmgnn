Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. We will go step-by-step to identify each triangle and then provide the final count within brackets [] at the end.

1. Looking at node 0: 
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 7. However, there is no direct connection between nodes 4 and 7. So, no triangle can be formed with node 0.

2. Looking at node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8. No triangle can be formed with node 1 due to the lack of direct connections between these nodes.

3. Looking at node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6. A triangle can be formed with nodes 2, 3, and 6: <2, 3, 6>.
   
4. Looking at node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8. Already considered the <2, 3, 6> triangle with node 2. No new triangle with node 3.

5. Looking at node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8. No triangle can be formed with node 4.

6. Looking at node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9. No triangle can be formed with node 5.

7. Looking at node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5. Triangle <2, 3, 6> already considered. No new triangle with node 6.

8. Looking at node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9. No triangle can be formed with node 7.

9. Looking at node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 7. No new triangles with node 8.

10. Looking at node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 7. No triangle can be formed with node 9.

Only one unique triangle was found: <2, 3, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
