Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's consider each node and determine the triangles it is part of.

- Node 0 is part of <0, 1, 3> and <0, 3, 7>.
- Node 1 is part of <0, 1, 3>, <1, 2, 3>, and <1, 6, 4>.
- Node 2 is not part of any triangle.
- Node 3 is part of <0, 1, 3> and <1, 3, 4>.
- Node 4 is part of <3, 4, 6> and <4, 5, 7>.
- Node 5 is not part of any triangle.
- Node 6 is part of <1, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 7>, and <6, 8, 9>.
- Node 7 is part of <0, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, and <4, 5, 7>.
- Node 8 is part of <6, 8, 9>.
- Node 9 is part of <6, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
