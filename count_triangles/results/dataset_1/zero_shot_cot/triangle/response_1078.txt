Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
In order to count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the given edges.

Let's list the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 8, 9>

There are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
