Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first identify all the triangles present in the graph. 

Let's list the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 5, 3>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 9, 4>
4. <3, 1, 4>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <1, 4, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph: [6]
