Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph consists of the following edges based on the given information:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to node 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 2.

To count the number of triangles in the graph:
1. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 6. Triangle: <1, 5, 6>
2. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 8. Triangle: <2, 3, 8>
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 5. Triangle: <2, 3, 5>
4. Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 7. Triangle: <1, 5, 7>
5. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 4. Triangle: <1, 4, 6>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in total in the given graph.
