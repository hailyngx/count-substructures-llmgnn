Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's enumerate each triangle below:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <1, 3, 8>
5. <4, 5, 7>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
