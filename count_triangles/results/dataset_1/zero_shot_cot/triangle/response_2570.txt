Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, we will identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

Let's list all the triangles found in this graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 3, 2>

Finally, we state the total number of triangles found in the graph within brackets:
