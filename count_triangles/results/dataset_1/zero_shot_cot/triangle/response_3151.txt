Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Start by identifying the triangles in the graph based on the given edges:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
4. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <5, 6, 7>

Now count the total number of triangles: [5]
