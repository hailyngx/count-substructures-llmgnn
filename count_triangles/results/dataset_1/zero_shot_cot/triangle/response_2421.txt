Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

Looking at the graph, we can see that a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. In this case, we have the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <1, 2, 6>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <2, 3, 6>
6. <2, 5, 6>
7. <3, 5, 7>
8. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
