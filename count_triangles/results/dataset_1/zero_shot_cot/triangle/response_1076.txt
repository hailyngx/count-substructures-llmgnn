Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

From the given edges, we can identify the triangles as follows:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 8>

So there are 2 triangles in total. Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [2].
