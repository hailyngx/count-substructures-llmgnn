Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.

Let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 6)
- Triangle 2: (0, 2, 3)
- Triangle 3: (4, 5, 9)
- Triangle 4: (4, 6, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4] and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 3>, <4, 5, 9>, and <4, 6, 8>.
