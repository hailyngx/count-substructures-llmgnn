Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph by checking for nodes that form triangles together:

1. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 4>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **5** [<0, 6, 9>, <0, 1, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <0, 6, 8>, <6, 8, 9>].
