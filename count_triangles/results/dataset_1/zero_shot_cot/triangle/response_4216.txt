Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. I will go step-by-step to find all the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 7, 8)
2. Triangle 2: (2, 5, 7)
3. Triangle 3: (2, 8, 9)
4. Triangle 4: (3, 2, 8)
5. Triangle 5: (5, 7, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 7, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 2, 8>, and <5, 7, 9>.
