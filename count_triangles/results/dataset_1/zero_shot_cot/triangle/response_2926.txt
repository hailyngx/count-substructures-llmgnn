Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected. Here are the steps to find the triangles:

Step 1: Identify the triangles:
- Based on the given edges, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <2, 8, 4>
3. <2, 8, 5>
4. <2, 9, 6>
5. <3, 5, 7>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles:
- There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
