Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's enumerate all possible triangles using the given edges:
1. (0, 1, 9)
2. (0, 1, 7)
3. (0, 7, 9)
4. (1, 3, 9)
5. (1, 8, 9)
6. (2, 5, 6)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
