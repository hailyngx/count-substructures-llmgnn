Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for the closed loops of length 3, which indicate the presence of triangles.

Let's identify the triangles step by step:
1. (0, 1, 3)
2. (0, 1, 6)
3. (0, 3, 5)
4. (0, 3, 9)
5. (1, 3, 6)
6. (1, 7, 8)
7. (3, 5, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
