Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 7, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 7, 2>
4. Triangle <1, 3, 4>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
6. Triangle <6, 0, 7>
7. Triangle <7, 5, 3>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
