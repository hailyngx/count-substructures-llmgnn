Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Identify all the triangles formed by three connected nodes.

Let's list down the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <1, 2, 4>
3. <0, 1, 3>
4. <1, 4, 6>
5. <1, 4, 7>
6. <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
