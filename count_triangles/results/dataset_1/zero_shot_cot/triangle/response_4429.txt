Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
5. Node 5 is connected to node 7.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
8. Node 8 is connected to node 3.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 6, 4)
- Triangle 2: (0, 6, 2)
- Triangle 3: (0, 6, 9)
- Triangle 4: (2, 6, 4)
- Triangle 5: (3, 4, 6)
- Triangle 6: (3, 6, 0)
- Triangle 7: (3, 6, 2)
- Triangle 8: (4, 6, 0)
- Triangle 9: (4, 6, 2)
- Triangle 10: (4, 6, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10] and the unique triangles found are <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 0>, <3, 6, 2>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 2>, <4, 6, 9>.
