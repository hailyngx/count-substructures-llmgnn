Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Triangles are formed by three interconnected nodes.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle involving nodes (0, 7, 8): <0, 7, 8>
2. Triangle involving nodes (0, 7, 9): <0, 7, 9>
3. Triangle involving nodes (0, 8, 9): <0, 8, 9>
4. Triangle involving nodes (2, 4, 5): <2, 4, 5>
5. Triangle involving nodes (3, 5, 7): <3, 5, 7>
6. Triangle involving nodes (5, 4, 2): <2, 4, 5>
7. Triangle involving nodes (6, 1, 7): <1, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [7]
