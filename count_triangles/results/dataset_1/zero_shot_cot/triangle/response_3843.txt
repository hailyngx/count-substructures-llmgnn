Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are pairwise connected.

Let's list the triangles first:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 8, 6>
<1, 4, 2>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 7>
<9, 0, 5>
<9, 5, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph: [7]
