Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by listing the triangles:
1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <4, 5, 7>
4. <5, 6, 7>
5. <7, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
