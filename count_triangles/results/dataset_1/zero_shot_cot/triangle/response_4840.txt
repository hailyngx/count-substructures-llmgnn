Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Count the number of triangles in the given graph by checking each possible triangle formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected with edges.

Step 2: List the unique triangles found.

Step 3: Output the total number of triangles inside brackets.

Let's proceed with the calculations.

List of unique triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 9, 1>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [5]
