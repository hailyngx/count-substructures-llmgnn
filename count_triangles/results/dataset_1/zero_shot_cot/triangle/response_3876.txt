Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. We will look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

After examining the provided edges, we find the following triangles:

1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <1, 3, 7>
3. <2, 5, 9>
4. <3, 6, 7>
5. <4, 7, 8>

There are a total of 5 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
