Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph by examining each combination of three connected nodes.

The triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 8, 1>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 1>
<3, 8, 9>
<9, 8, 6>

So, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
