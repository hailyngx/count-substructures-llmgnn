Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here is the list of unique triangles found in this graph:
<0, 1, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
