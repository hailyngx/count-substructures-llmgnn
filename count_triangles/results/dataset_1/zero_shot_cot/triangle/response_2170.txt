Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 6, 3>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles found and output it within brackets:

Total number of triangles: [5]
