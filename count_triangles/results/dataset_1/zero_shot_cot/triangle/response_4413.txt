Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
From the given graph information, we see that there are several triangles. Let's list them out step by step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {2, 5, 8}
2. Nodes connected to node 1: {2, 5}
3. Nodes connected to node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
4. Nodes connected to node 3: {2, 4}
5. Nodes connected to node 4: {2, 3, 6}
6. Nodes connected to node 5: {0, 1, 6}
7. Nodes connected to node 6: {4, 5}
8. Nodes connected to node 7: {8}
9. Nodes connected to node 8: {0, 7, 9}
10. Nodes connected to node 9: {2, 8}

Now, we can count the number of triangles formed by each node:
- Node 0 forms triangles with {2, 5} and {2, 8}.
- Node 2 forms triangles with {0, 1}, {0, 4}, and {1, 3}.
- Node 4 forms a triangle with {2, 6}.
- Node 5 forms a triangle with {0, 1}.
- Node 8 forms a triangle with {0, 9}.

So, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5] as shown above.
