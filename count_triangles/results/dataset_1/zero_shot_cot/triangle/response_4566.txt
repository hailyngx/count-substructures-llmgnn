Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles in the graph by checking for each possible triangle formed by 3 nodes connected by edges.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's find the triangles in the given graph:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <3, 4, 7>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
