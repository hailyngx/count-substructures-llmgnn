Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a matrix form:

```
    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  
1 [ 0  0  0  0  0  1  1  0  1 ]
2 [ 0  0  1  0  1  0  0  1  1 ]
3 [ 0  1  0  0  0  1  0  1  0 ]
4 [ 0  0  0  0  1  0  1  1  0 ]
5 [ 0  1  0  1  0  0  1  0  1 ]
6 [ 1  0  1  0  0  0  0  1  0 ]
7 [ 1  0  0  1  1  0  0  0  0 ]
8 [ 0  1  1  1  0  1  0  0  0 ]
9 [ 1  1  0  0  1  0  0  0  0 ]
```

Next, we will find the triangles in the graph. A triangle in a graph is formed when three vertices are all connected to each other. To count the triangles, we check for each triplet of vertices if they form a triangle.

The triangles in this graph are:
- <1, 2, 9>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **[7]**.
