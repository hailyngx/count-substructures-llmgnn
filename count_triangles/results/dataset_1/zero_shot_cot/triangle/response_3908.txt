Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in this graph. Here they are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 8>

So, the total number of triangles is [4].
