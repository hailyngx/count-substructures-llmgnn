Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify triangles by looking for nodes that form cycles of length 3.

2. We will go through each node and check if there are two edges connecting the node to pairs of other nodes.

3. We will then check if there is an edge directly connecting the two other nodes forming a triangle.

Let's start by listing all the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <1, 2, 4>
4. <1, 4, 9>
5. <1, 8, 5>
6. <2, 4, 5>
7. <4, 7, 0>
8. <4, 7, 0>
9. <4, 1, 9>
10. <4, 9, 6>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
