Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <1, 7, 9>

So, there are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
