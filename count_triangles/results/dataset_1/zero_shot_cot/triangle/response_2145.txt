Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Count the total number of triangles in the graph based on the given edges.
- A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected in a closed loop. We need to find all possible triangles in the graph based on the given edges.

Step 2: Identify the triangles by examining each set of three connected nodes.
- (0, 2, 4) form a triangle.
- (0, 2, 5) form a triangle.
- (2, 4, 5) form a triangle.
- (4, 5, 9) form a triangle.
- (6, 3, 7) form a triangle.
- (6, 7, 8) form a triangle.

Step 3: Count the total number of unique triangles found.
- There are 6 unique triangles found in the graph.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <6, 3, 7>, <6, 7, 8>.
