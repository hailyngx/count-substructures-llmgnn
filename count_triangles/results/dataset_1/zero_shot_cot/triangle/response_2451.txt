Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine every triplet of nodes and check if they form a triangle by having edges between all pairs of nodes in the triplet. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Nodes with their connections:
   - Node 0: 5, 7, 9
   - Node 1: 7, 8, 9
   - Node 2: 3, 5, 8
   - Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 8
   - Node 4: 3, 6, 9
   - Node 5: 0, 2, 8, 9
   - Node 6: 3, 4, 8
   - Node 7: 0, 1, 9
   - Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
   - Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7

2. Now, let's enumerate the triangles by checking every triplet of nodes:
   - Triangles: <0, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
