Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by the connected nodes. Here's how we can find the triangles:

1. Node 1 is connected to node 5.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
3. Node 3 is connected to node 8.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 6.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
8. Node 9 is connected to node 6.

Based on the connections, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <1, 5, 6>
2. <2, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
