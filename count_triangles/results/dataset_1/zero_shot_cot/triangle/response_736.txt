Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <0, 6, 7>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <1, 4, 6>
5. <1, 6, 9>
6. <2, 3, 5>
7. <2, 5, 8>
8. <3, 4, 5>
9. <3, 5, 6>
10. <4, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [10].
