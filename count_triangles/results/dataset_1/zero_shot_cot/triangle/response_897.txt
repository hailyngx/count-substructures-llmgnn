Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected with each other (i.e., form a triangle). Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 3, 5, and 6: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 6>.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 2 and 9: <1, 2, 9>.
3. Node 2 forms triangles with nodes 4 and 5: <2, 4, 5>.
4. Node 3 does not form any triangles.
5. Node 4 does not form any triangles.
6. Node 5 does not form any triangles.
7. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 8: <6, 1, 8>.
8. Node 7 forms triangles with nodes 4, 8, and 9: <7, 4, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.
9. Node 8 does not form any triangles.
10. Node 9 does not form any triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
