Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are interconnected to form a triangle.

Let's start by inspecting each unique triangle in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 6, 1>
2. Triangle <0, 6, 3>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <1, 4, 6>
6. Triangle <2, 3, 4>
7. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
8. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
9. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
10. Triangle <4, 7, 6>
11. Triangle <4, 7, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
