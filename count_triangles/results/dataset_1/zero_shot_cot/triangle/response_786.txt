Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the given graph:

1. {0, 5, 0}
2. {2, 3, 7}
3. {2, 3, 9}
4. {2, 7, 9}
5. {3, 7, 9}

So, there are 5 triangles in total. Thus, the answer is [5].
