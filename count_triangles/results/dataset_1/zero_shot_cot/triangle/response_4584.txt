Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's identify the possible triangles formed by the edges provided.

Recall that a triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected by edges. Let's list the unique triangles:

1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <1, 6, 8>
5. <1, 6, 9>
6. <1, 7, 8>
7. <1, 7, 9>
8. <2, 3, 7>
9. <6, 8, 9>

Count of triangles: [9]
