Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Starting from each node, we will check if there are any triangles that can be formed. Below are the unique triangles found:
1. <1, 2, 9>
2. <1, 3, 8>
3. <1, 6, 9>
4. <2, 3, 9>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <3, 6, 9>
7. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
