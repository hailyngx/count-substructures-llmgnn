Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.

Now, let's list the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 1>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 3: <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle 4: <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle 6: <4, 7, 8>
- Triangle 7: <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [7].
