Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all combinations of 3 nodes that are connected by edges.

Counting triangles step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 6.

Now, let's start finding triangles:
1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <1, 2, 6>
5. <3, 1, 6>
6. <3, 8, 0>
7. <4, 3, 8>
8. <5, 4, 3>
9. <5, 4, 5> (not a triangle, as it forms a loop)
10. <5, 8, 0>
11. <6, 8, 0>
12. <6, 8, 8> (not a triangle, as it involves the same node multiple times)
13. <7, 0, 8>
14. <8, 3, 5>

Total number of triangles: [13]
