Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in this graph. 
The unique triangles are:
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 3, 9>
<5, 1, 8>
<6, 3, 7> 

So, the total number of triangles is [7].
