Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the given edges. 

Let's list all the triangles first:
1. <0, 4, 3>
2. <0, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
