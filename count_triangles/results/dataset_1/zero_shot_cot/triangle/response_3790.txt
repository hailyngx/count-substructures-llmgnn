Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will check each possible triangle that can be formed using the given edges.

1. Nodes 0, 1, and 6 form a triangle.
2. Nodes 1, 2, and 5 form a triangle.
3. Nodes 1, 5, and 9 form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
