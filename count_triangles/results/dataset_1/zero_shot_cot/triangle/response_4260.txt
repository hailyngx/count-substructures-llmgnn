Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in this graph, we first need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges given.

Let's start by listing the triangles found in the graph:
1. <1, 2, 7>
2. <2, 5, 7>
3. <2, 7, 9>
4. <4, 5, 7>
5. <0, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
