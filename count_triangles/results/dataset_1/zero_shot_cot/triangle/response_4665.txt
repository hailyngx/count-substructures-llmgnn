Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to node 2
- Node 5 is connected to node 3
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 3
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6

To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by considering each possible combination of three nodes that are connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are: 
- <1, 6, 8>
- <2, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
