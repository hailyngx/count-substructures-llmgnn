Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 7
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 4

Step 2: Identify triangles.
- There are no triangles involving nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8 due to their low degrees.
- Nodes 1, 4, and 5 can form a triangle: <1, 4, 5>.
- Nodes 1, 5, and 6 can also form a triangle: <1, 5, 6>.
- Since node 1 is common, nodes 4 and 6 can form another triangle: <1, 4, 6>.
- Nodes 2, 4, and 9 can form a triangle: <2, 4, 9>.
- Nodes 2, 5, and 9 can form another triangle: <2, 5, 9>.

Step 3: Count the number of triangles.
- Total number of triangles: [5]
