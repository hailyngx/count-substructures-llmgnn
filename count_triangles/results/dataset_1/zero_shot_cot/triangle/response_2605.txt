Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 6, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, and <7, 8, 9>.
