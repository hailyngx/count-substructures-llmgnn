Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles present in the given graph:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7.
2. Nodes connected to node 1: 0.
3. Nodes connected to node 2: 0, 5.
4. Nodes connected to node 3: 0, 5, 6, 7.
5. Nodes connected to node 4: 7, 8.
6. Nodes connected to node 5: 2, 3.
7. Nodes connected to node 6: 0, 3, 7.
8. Nodes connected to node 7: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9.
9. Nodes connected to node 8: 4.
10. Nodes connected to node 9: 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 4: <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle 5: <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
