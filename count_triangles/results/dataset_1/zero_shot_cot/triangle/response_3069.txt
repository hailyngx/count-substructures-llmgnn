Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 8.

Now, let's find the triangles in this graph:
1. <2, 5, 9>
2. <2, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
