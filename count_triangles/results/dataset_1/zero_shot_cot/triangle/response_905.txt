Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
I will now determine the total number of triangles in the given graph.

Let's list the triangles using the given edges:
1. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 2, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
7. Triangle <2, 7, 8>
8. Triangle <4, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [8]
