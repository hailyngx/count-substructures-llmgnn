Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the set.

Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
