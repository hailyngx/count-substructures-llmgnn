Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <4, 5, 7>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [5]
