Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we can analyze the triangles by looking for closed loops of length 3. 

Analyzing the given edges, we can find the following triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 9, 4>
5. Triangle <2, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <6, 1, 7>
7. Triangle <6, 5, 1>
8. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
9. Triangle <6, 8, 2>
10. Triangle <7, 8, 2>
11. Triangle <7, 8, 3>
12. Triangle <7, 8, 6>
13. Triangle <8, 3, 9>
14. Triangle <8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
