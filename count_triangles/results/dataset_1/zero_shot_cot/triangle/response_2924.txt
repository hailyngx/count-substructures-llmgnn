Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Nodes with their connections:
   - Node 0: 9
   - Node 1: 4, 6
   - Node 2: 5, 6
   - Node 3: 6
   - Node 4: 1
   - Node 5: 2, 9
   - Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
   - Node 7: 6
   - Node 8: 9
   - Node 9: 0, 5, 6, 8

2. Identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <1, 2, 6>
   - Triangle 2: <6, 9, 0>

3. Count of triangles: [2]
