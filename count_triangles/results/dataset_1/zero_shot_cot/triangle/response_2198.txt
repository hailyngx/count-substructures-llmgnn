Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are mutually connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1 and 4: 
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>

2. Node 1 forms a triangle with node 7: 
   - Triangle 2: <1, 0, 7>

3. Node 2 does not form any triangles.

4. Node 3 does not form any triangles.

5. Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 0 and 9:
   - Triangle 3: <4, 0, 3>
   - Triangle 4: <4, 0, 9>
   
6. Node 5 forms a triangle with node 6: 
   - Triangle 5: <5, 2, 6>

7. Node 6 forms a triangle with node 9: 
   - Triangle 6: <6, 5, 9>

8. Node 7 forms a triangle with node 9: 
   - Triangle 7: <7, 1, 9>

9. Node 8 does not form any triangles.

10. Node 9 forms triangles with nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7:
   - Triangle 8: <9, 2, 5>
   - Triangle 9: <9, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 10: <9, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
