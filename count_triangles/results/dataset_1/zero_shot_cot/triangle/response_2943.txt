Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify the triangles using the given edges:
- Looking at the edges, we can see that a triangle is formed when there are three nodes connected in a closed loop.
- We'll check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle.

List of Triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles:
- [7]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
