Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify triangles by checking nodes that have edges connecting them. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Step 2: List out the unique triangles found.

Step 3: Count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's start by listing out the unique triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 5, 3>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 8, 3>
4. <2, 3, 5>
5. <2, 3, 8>
6. <3, 5, 0>
7. <3, 5, 8>
8. <3, 8, 0>
9. <4, 2, 3>
10. <8, 6, 9>

There are 10 unique triangles in total. So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
