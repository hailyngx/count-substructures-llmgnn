Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's list all the triangles in the graph:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 5>

There are 2 triangles in total. Therefore, the answer would be [2].
