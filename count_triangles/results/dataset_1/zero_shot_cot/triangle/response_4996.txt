Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.
Firstly, we identify all the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <2, 0, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
4. Triangle <2, 0, 4>
5. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
6. Triangle <3, 0, 6>
7. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
8. Triangle <4, 2, 9>
9. Triangle <0, 6, 2>
10. Triangle <6, 0, 2>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph.
So, the output will be [10].
