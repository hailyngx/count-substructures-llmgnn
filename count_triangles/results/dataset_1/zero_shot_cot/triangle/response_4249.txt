Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected by edges.

Let's start by listing all possible triangles:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <0, 4, 9>
5. <2, 7, 8>
6. <3, 6, 8>
7. <3, 4, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
