Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the provided graph:

Nodes - 0, 3, 9 form a triangle <0, 3, 9>.
Nodes - 2, 4, 6 form a triangle <2, 4, 6>.
Nodes - 2, 6, 7 form a triangle <2, 6, 7>.
Nodes - 2, 4, 9 form a triangle <2, 4, 9>.
Nodes - 4, 5, 6 form a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
Nodes - 5, 7, 8 form a triangle <5, 7, 8>.

Hence, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
