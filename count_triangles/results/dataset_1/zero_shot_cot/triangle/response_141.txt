Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Observing the given graph:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 6), (6, 7)

Let's count the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [3]
