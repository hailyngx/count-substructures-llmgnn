Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [2].

The unique triangles found are <4, 6, 8> and <4, 8, 9>.
