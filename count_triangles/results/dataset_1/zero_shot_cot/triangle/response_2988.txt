Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 8>
