Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by 3 connected nodes.

Here are the unique triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <2, 6, 7>
3. <2, 4, 9>
4. <3, 5, 6>
5. <3, 6, 7>
6. <4, 6, 7>
7. <4, 7, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
