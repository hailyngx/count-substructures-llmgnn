Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we will have to identify the unique triangles formed by the nodes based on the given edges. Let's start by listing out the triangles:

1. <0, 5, 2>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <0, 6, 1>
6. <0, 6, 4>
7. <0, 6, 7>
8. <0, 6, 9>
9. <0, 8, 9>
10. <1, 3, 9>
11. <6, 4, 7>
12. <6, 7, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles [12].
