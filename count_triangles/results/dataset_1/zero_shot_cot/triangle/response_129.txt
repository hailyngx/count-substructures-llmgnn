Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each set of three vertices and see if all three possible edges between them are present in the graph. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Vertices connected with each other:
   - Vertex 0: 1, 3, 8
   - Vertex 1: 0
   - Vertex 2: 3
   - Vertex 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
   - Vertex 4: 3, 6, 8
   - Vertex 5: 3, 6
   - Vertex 6: 4, 5, 9
   - Vertex 7: 9
   - Vertex 8: 0, 3, 4, 9
   - Vertex 9: 6, 7, 8

2. Potential triangles (vertices with at least 2 connections):
   - Triangle 1: <0, 3, 8>
   - Triangle 2: <3, 4, 8>
   - Triangle 3: <3, 6, 9>
   - Triangle 4: <4, 6, 8>

3. Total number of triangles: [4]
