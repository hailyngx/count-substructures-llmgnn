Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all the triangles formed by the given edges. 

- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 8)
- Triangle 2: (1, 5, 7)
- Triangle 3: (1, 5, 6)
- Triangle 4: (1, 6, 7)
- Triangle 5: (2, 4, 8)
- Triangle 6: (4, 5, 7)
- Triangle 7: (4, 5, 6)
- Triangle 8: (5, 6, 7)
- Triangle 9: (8, 9, 3)
  
Step 2: Count the number of unique triangles from Step 1.
