Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Looking at node 0: It has edges with nodes 3, 4, and 5. Since nodes 3, 4, and 5 are interconnected through node 0, we found one triangle <3, 4, 5>.

2. Looking at node 1: It has edges with nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5. Since nodes 2, 3, and 4 are interconnected through node 1, we found another triangle <2, 3, 4>.

3. Looking at node 2: It has edges with nodes 1, 7, and 8. Since none of these nodes are interconnected, there are no triangles with node 2.

4. Looking at node 3: It has edges with nodes 0 and 1. We have already found the triangle <3, 4, 5> connected to node 0, but we can also form a triangle <0, 3, 1> with node 1.

5. Looking at node 4: It has edges with nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9. We have already found the triangle <3, 4, 5> connected to node 0 and the triangle <2, 3, 4> connected to node 1. We can also form a triangle <1, 4, 6> and <4, 9, 7>.

6. Looking at node 5: It has edges with nodes 0 and 1. Since we have already considered all possible triangles connected to nodes 0 and 1, there are no additional triangles formed with node 5.

7. Looking at node 6: It has an edge with node 4. However, we have already considered the triangle <1, 4, 6> connected to node 4.

8. Looking at node 7: It has edges with nodes 2, 8, and 9. We can form a triangle <2, 7, 8> and <7, 9, 4>.

9. Looking at node 8: It has edges with nodes 2 and 7. Since we have already considered all possible triangles connected to node 2 and 7, there are no additional triangles with node 8.

10. Looking at node 9: It has edges with nodes 4 and 7. We have already found the triangle <4, 9, 7> connected to node 7.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7], and the unique triangles found are <3, 4, 5>, <0, 3, 1>, <1, 4, 6>, <4, 9, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>.
