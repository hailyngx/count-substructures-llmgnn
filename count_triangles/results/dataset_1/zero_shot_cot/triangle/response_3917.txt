Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can calculate the number of triangles by examining each possible combination of three nodes.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 2, 4>
4. <1, 2, 5>
5. <1, 2, 6>
6. <2, 3, 4>
7. <2, 3, 7>
8. <2, 5, 7>
9. <3, 4, 7>
10. <3, 4, 9>
11. <5, 7, 9>
12. <8, 9, 3>
13. <8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
