Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, let's first identify all the triangles present.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <1, 9, 8>
4. <2, 5, 8>
5. <8, 6, 4>
6. <8, 6, 9>
7. <8, 4, 7>
8. <8, 9, 1>

Total number of triangles in the graph is: [8]
