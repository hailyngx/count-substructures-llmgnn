Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

By visually inspecting the graph based on the provided edges, we can list the unique triangles:
1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <3, 4, 8>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
