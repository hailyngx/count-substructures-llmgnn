Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9.
8. Node 9 is connected to node 7.

Now, we will identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 3>
- Triangle 3: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 4: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 5: <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle 6: <2, 3, 7>
- Triangle 7: <2, 5, 0>
- Triangle 8: <7, 3, 0>
- Triangle 9: <7, 3, 2>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

The total number of triangles is [9].
