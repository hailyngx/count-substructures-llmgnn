Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the graph.
