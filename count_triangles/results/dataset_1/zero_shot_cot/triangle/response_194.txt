Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

1. Let's inspect each node and its neighbors to find the triangles:
   - Node 0: (0, 1) and (0, 5) are connected. However, there is no direct edge between nodes 1 and 5.
   - Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), and (1, 8) form triangles with different combinations of connected nodes.
   - Node 2: (2, 1) and (2, 5) are connected. However, there is no direct edge between nodes 1 and 5.
   - Node 3: (3, 1) and (3, 4) are connected. There is a direct edge between nodes 1 and 4, forming a triangle.
   - Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), and (4, 8) form triangles with different combinations of connected nodes.
   - Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 4) form triangles with different combinations of connected nodes.
   - Node 6: (6, 4) and (6, 7) are connected. There is no direct edge between nodes 4 and 7.
   - Node 7: (7, 2) and (7, 6) are connected. There is no direct edge between nodes 2 and 6.
   - Node 8: (8, 1) and (8, 4) are connected. There is no direct edge between nodes 1 and 4.

2. Based on the examination above, we find the following unique triangles:
   - <1, 3, 4>

3. The total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
