Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles present in the graph by examining each possible combination of three nodes:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <0, 4, 8>
5. <2, 4, 7>
6. <3, 4, 5>
7. <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
