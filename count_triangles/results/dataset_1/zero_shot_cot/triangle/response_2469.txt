Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, we can determine the number of triangles present by finding all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 8, 4>
<1, 8, 5>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 8, 5>
<3, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
