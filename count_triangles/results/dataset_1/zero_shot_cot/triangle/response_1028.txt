Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <2, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
