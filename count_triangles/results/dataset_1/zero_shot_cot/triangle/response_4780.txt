Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the concept of triangles in a graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Look for triangles involving node 0:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 3)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 3, 5)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 5, 7)
   
2. Look for triangles involving node 1:
   - Triangle 4: (1, 0, 3)
   - Triangle 5: (1, 3, 4)
   
3. Look for triangles involving node 3:
   - Triangle 6: (3, 0, 1)
   - Triangle 7: (3, 1, 4)
   
4. Look for triangles involving node 4:
   - Triangle 8: (4, 1, 9)
   - Triangle 9: (4, 9, 7)
   
5. Look for triangles involving node 7:
   - Triangle 10: (7, 0, 5)
   
6. Calculating the total number of triangles: 10 triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 0, 3>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 0, 1>, <3, 1, 4>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 9, 7>, and <7, 0, 5>.
