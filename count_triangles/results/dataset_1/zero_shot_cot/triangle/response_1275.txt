Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 9>.
