Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided.

Given edges:
- (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6)
- (2, 6)
- (3, 0) (3, 8)
- (4, 5) (4, 6)
- (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9)
- (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8)
- (7, 5)
- (8, 3) (8, 6)
- (9, 5)

Let's list the unique triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <3, 5, 0>
5. <3, 5, 6>
6. <3, 0, 6>
7. <4, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [7]
