Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle 3: <2, 4, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
