Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are mutually connected.

By examining the given edges, we can identify the following triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <1, 3, 4>
4. <2, 3, 4>
5. <2, 3, 6>
6. <2, 3, 7>
7. <3, 6, 7>
8. <8, 9, 0>
9. <9, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
