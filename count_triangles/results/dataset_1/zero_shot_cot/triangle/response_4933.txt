Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Here are the steps to find the triangles:

1. Look for nodes that form triangles by having edges connecting them:
   - <0, 1, 7>
   - <1, 3, 6>
   - <1, 5, 6>
   - <1, 6, 8>
   - <5, 6, 7>

Count the total number of unique triangles found: [5]
