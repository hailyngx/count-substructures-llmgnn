Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triangles by checking each triplet of nodes that are connected by edges.

Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. We can see all the edges given and represent them in the adjacency matrix format for easier visualization:

\[
\begin{array}{cccccccccc}
0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
3 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
4 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
5 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
6 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
7 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
8 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
9 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

2. To find the triangles, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

3. By examining the adjacency matrix, the set of triangles in this graph are:

   - <1, 5, 8>
   - <1, 5, 9>

4. Counting the total number of triangles, we find that there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
