Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step in identifying the triangles:

1. Check for triangles starting with node 0:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 3, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 3, 8>

2. Check for triangles starting with node 1:
   - No triangles with node 1 as the starting node.

3. Check for triangles starting with node 2:
   - No triangles with node 2 as the starting node.

4. Check for triangles starting with node 3:
   - Triangle 3: <3, 7, 1>
   - Triangle 4: <3, 7, 5>
   
5. Check for triangles starting with node 4:
   - No triangles with node 4 as the starting node.

6. Check for triangles starting with node 5:
   - No triangles with node 5 as the starting node.

7. Check for triangles starting with node 6:
   - No triangles with node 6 as the starting node.

8. Check for triangles starting with node 7:
   - Triangle 5: <7, 1, 9>
   - Triangle 6: <7, 2, 3>
   - Triangle 7: <7, 2, 6>
   - Triangle 8: <7, 3, 5>
   
9. Check for triangles starting with node 8:
   - No triangles with node 8 as the starting node.

10. Check for triangles starting with node 9:
   - No triangles with node 9 as the starting node.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
