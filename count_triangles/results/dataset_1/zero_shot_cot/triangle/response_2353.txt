Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for combinations of nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's break it down step-by-step:
   
Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 6)

Now, let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 6, 9>
2. <2, 4, 6>
3. <7, 4, 5> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
