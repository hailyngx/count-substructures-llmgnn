Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are interconnected.

1. Let's list out the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 9>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 2, 8>
   - Triangle 3: <1, 4, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 4, 9>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 4, 9>
   
2. Now, let's count the number of unique triangles found:
   - Total number of triangles: [5]
