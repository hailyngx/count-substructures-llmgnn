Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to determine the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 1.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 1.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.

Now, let's list down the unique triangles that we find:
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <1, 8, 9>

From the above triangles, we can see that there are 3 unique triangles in total. Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
