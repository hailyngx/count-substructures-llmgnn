Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 3, and 6 form a triangle.
- Triangle 2: Nodes 2, 3, and 9 form a triangle.
- Triangle 3: Nodes 4, 6, and 7 form a triangle.
- Triangle 4: Nodes 4, 7, and 5 form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, and <4, 7, 5>.
