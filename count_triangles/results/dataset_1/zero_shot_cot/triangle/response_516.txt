Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each possible triangle formed by the nodes and see if all three edges exist.

1. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <3, 7, 9>
3. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <5, 3, 6>
5. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. So, the output is [5].
