Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. We can see that the graph has 10 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
2. There are 34 edges given.
3. To find the number of triangles, we need to find all the sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.
4. Let's list the unique triangles found based on the given edges:

- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <6, 9, 7>

5. Counting the total number of triangles, we find [7 triangles].
