Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles present.

Let's list out all the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <1, 5, 9>
3. <2, 3, 7>
4. <2, 7, 9>
5. <3, 5, 8>
6. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
