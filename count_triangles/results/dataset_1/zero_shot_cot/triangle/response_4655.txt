Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 0.

Now, let's list the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 3, 8>
4. <1, 3, 2>
5. <1, 3, 5>
6. <1, 4, 2>
7. <3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
