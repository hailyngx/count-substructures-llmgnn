Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected by edges. Let's start by listing all the triangles found in the graph:

1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <2, 5, 7>
3. <4, 0, 1>
4. <4, 1, 3>
5. <4, 2, 7>
6. <4, 3, 6>
7. <5, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
