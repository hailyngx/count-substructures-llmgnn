Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph.

To find a triangle, we need to look for a set of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes. We can count the triangles by examining each possible set of three nodes.

Now let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 6, 0>
<1, 6, 9>
<6, 2, 8>
<6, 2, 7>
<6, 2, 1>
<6, 2, 3>
<6, 2, 5>
<6, 2, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
