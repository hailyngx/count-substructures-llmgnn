Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles present in this graph:

1. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
4. Triangle <3, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
