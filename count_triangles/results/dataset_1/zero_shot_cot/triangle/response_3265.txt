Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:
1. Triangle formed by nodes {1, 2, 7}: <1, 2, 7>
2. Triangle formed by nodes {1, 5, 7}: <1, 5, 7>
3. Triangle formed by nodes {2, 7, 8}: <2, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
