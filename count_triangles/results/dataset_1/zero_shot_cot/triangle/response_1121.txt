Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow these steps:

Step 1: List all possible triangles
- Triangle 1: (1, 3, 6)
- Triangle 2: (1, 3, 7)
- Triangle 3: (3, 6, 7)

Step 2: Calculate the sum of triangles
- Total number of triangles = 3

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, and <3, 6, 7>.
