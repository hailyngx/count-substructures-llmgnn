Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Calculate the triangles by checking all possible combinations of nodes that form triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 2, 3)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 3, 9)
   - Triangle 3: (3, 7, 9)
   - Triangle 4: (0, 3, 4)
   - Triangle 5: (0, 4, 8)
   - Triangle 6: (1, 5, 7)
   - Triangle 7: (5, 7, 8)

2. Count the total number of triangles found: [7]

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, and <5, 7, 8>.
