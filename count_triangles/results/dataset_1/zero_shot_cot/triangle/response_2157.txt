Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each unique triangle formed by three connected nodes. 

Let's list the unique triangles:
1. <1, 4, 5>
2. <1, 5, 9>
3. <4, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
