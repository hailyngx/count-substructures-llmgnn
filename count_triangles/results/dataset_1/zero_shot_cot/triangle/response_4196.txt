Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, where each triangle consists of three nodes connected by edges, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's calculate the total number of triangles step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify triangles by looking at each node and its connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
  - Triangle <0, 2, 5> exists.
- Node 1 is connected to node 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
  - Triangle <0, 2, 5> exists.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8.
  - Triangles <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, and <1, 3, 8> exist.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
  - Triangle <4, 6, 8> exists.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
  - Triangle <0, 2, 5> exists.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
  - Triangle <3, 4, 6> exists.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles found:
- Total number of triangles = 3 (formed by nodes 0, 2, 5) + 6 (formed by nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, 8) + 1 (formed by nodes 4, 6, 8) + 1 (formed by nodes 3, 4, 6) = 11

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
