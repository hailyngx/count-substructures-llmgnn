Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

By examining the given edges, we can identify the triangles and count them:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
