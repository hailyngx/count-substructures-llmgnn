Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [\<0, 4, 6\> \<0, 4, 9\> \<0, 5, 2\> \<0, 8, 3\>]. There are 4 triangles in total.
