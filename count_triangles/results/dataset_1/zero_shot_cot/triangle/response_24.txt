Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles present in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. To find all the unique triangles, we can analyze all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected. 

The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. 

Let's list the triangles we find:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 8, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 6>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
