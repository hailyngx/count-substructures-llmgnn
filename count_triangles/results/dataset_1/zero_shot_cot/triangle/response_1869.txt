Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all the triangles formed by considering each set of three nodes that are all interconnected. 

Looking at the given edges, we can find the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 1>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <1, 2, 7>
4. <1, 2, 8>
5. <2, 7, 6>
6. <2, 8, 9>
7. <3, 5, 6>
8. <3, 5, 7>
9. <3, 7, 9>
10. <9, 4, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
