Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes connected by edges to each other forming a triangle.

Here is a list of unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
