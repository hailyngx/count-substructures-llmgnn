Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected.

Let's list the triangles found in this graph step-by-step:

1. Triangle: <0, 5, 9>
2. Triangle: <2, 4, 6>
3. Triangle: <2, 4, 5>
4. Triangle: <2, 4, 7>
5. Triangle: <2, 5, 6>
6. Triangle: <4, 5, 6>
7. Triangle: <4, 5, 7>
8. Triangle: <4, 6, 7>
9. Triangle: <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
