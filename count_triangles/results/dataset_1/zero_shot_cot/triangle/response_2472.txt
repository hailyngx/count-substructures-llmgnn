Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by the connected nodes. Let's go step-by-step:
1. Identify all triangles in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: (1, 2, 4)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 5, 3)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 5, 6)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 9, 5)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 1, 5)
   - Triangle 6: (5, 3, 6)
   - Triangle 7: (6, 0, 5)
2. Count the total number of triangles: 
   - There are 7 unique triangles in the given graph. 
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7]. The unique triangles are <1, 2, 4>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 9, 5>, <2, 1, 5>, <5, 3, 6>, <6, 0, 5>.
