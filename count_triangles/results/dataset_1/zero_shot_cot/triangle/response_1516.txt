Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph by checking each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

- Triangles: <0, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 8>

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles.

- Total number of triangles found: [4]
