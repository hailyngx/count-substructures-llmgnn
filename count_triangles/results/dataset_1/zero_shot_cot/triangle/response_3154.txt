Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The triangles found are:
<0, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
