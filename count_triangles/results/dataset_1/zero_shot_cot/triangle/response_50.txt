Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Start by looking at each possible triangle formed by three nodes:
    - For node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 7), (0, 1, 9), (0, 2, 8), (0, 3, 5), (0, 7, 9)
    
2. Count the triangles based on the given edges:
    - <0, 1, 2>
    - <0, 1, 3>
    - <0, 1, 5>
    - <0, 1, 7>
    - <0, 1, 9>
    - There are no other triangles present in this graph.

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
