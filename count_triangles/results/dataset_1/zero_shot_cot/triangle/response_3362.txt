Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
- Triangle 2: (0, 4, 8)
- Triangle 3: (0, 5, 8)
- Triangle 4: (1, 4, 8)

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in total.
