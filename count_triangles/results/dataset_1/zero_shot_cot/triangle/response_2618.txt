Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 14 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<0, 1, 3>
<6, 7, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 7, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<6, 7, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
