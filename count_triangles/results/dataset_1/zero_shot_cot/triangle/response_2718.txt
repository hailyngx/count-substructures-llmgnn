Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 triangles in this graph, and they are:

<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 3>
<9, 6, 7>

So, the total number of triangles is [10].
