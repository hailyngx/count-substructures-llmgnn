Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

Step 1: Identify triangles using the given edges:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 7>

Step 2: Count the number of unique triangles found:
- Total number of triangles: [3]
