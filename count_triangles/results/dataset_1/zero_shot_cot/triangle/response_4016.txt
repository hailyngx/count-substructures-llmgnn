Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's go step-by-step to determine the total number of triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to Node 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to Nodes 2, 6, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to Nodes 1 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to Nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to Nodes 0, 3, and 7.
6. Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7.
7. Node 7 is connected to Node 4.
8. Node 8 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to Nodes 3 and 8.

Now, let's identify the unique triangles present in this graph:

1. <1, 2, 6>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <1, 6, 3>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <2, 6, 3>
6. <3, 4, 7>
7. <3, 8, 9>
8. <4, 0, 7>
9. <4, 3, 7>
10. <8, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [(10 triangles)].
