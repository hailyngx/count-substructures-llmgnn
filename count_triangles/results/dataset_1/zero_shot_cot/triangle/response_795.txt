Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
