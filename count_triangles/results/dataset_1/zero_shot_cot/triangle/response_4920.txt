Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze the possible triangles formed by observing the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<5, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
