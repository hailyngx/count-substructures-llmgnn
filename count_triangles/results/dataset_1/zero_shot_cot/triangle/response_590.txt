Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Look for nodes that share connections with two other nodes. These triangles are the simplest to identify.

2. Check for triangles that require all three edges to be present.

Let's start by listing the triangles:  
<0, 4, 8>  
<1, 3, 5>  
<4, 8, 9>  
<6, 7, 8>  
<7, 8, 9>  

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
