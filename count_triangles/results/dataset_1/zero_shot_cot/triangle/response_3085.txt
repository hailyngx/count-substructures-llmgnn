Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.

Now, let's list the unique triangles:

1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <2, 5, 8>
3. <3, 1, 7>
4. <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
