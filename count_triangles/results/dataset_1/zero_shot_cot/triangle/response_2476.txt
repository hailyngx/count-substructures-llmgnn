Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in a graph, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify all the triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other to form a closed loop of length 3.
2. Count the total number of such triangles.

Now, let's list the triangles and count them:
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
