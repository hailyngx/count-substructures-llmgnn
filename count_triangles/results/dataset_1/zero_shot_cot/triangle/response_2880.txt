Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangles involving node 0: None
- Triangles involving node 1: None
- Triangles involving node 2: <2, 5, 9>
- Triangles involving node 3: None
- Triangles involving node 4: None
- Triangles involving node 5: None
- Triangles involving node 6: None
- Triangles involving node 7: None
- Triangles involving node 8: None
- Triangles involving node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
