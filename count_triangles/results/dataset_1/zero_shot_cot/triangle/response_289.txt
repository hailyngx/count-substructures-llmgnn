Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <1, 6, 9>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <3, 6, 9>
7. <3, 7, 9>
8. <5, 8, 9>
9. <7, 8, 9>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
