Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles where each set of three nodes is connected to each other.

Looking at the edges provided, let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 4>
4. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
6. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
7. Triangle <2, 6, 5>
8. Triangle <0, 7, 1>  

There are 8 triangles in total, so the output is:  
[8]
