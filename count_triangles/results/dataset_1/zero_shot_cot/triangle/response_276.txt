Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 3.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- <0, 3, 2>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 8, 5>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <5, 8, 0>
- <5, 8, 9>
- <6, 7, 1>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <9, 1, 7>
- <9, 1, 5>

There are 10 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
