Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's analyze the graph:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8.
Node 7 is connected to node 5.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.

Now, let's list out the unique triangles in the graph:

<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
