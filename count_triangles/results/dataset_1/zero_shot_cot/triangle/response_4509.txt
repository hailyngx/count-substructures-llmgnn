Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the triangles formed by each node.
    - Node 0: (0, 4, 8)
    - Node 1: (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 9)
    - Node 2: No triangles
    - Node 4: No new triangles
    - Node 5: No new triangles
    - Node 6: (1, 5, 6)
    - Node 7: No triangles
    - Node 8: No triangles
    - Node 9: No new triangles

Step 2: Sum up the total number of unique triangles found in Step 1.
    Total number of triangles: 2
