Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Write down the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 4, 9
Node 2: 6
Node 3: 4, 7
Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 9
Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 9
Node 6: 2, 5, 7
Node 7: 3, 6, 9
Node 8: 0
Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7

Step 2: Identify possible triangles:
- Looking at the neighbors of each node, we see that the only possible triangles are <0, 1, 9> and <4, 5, 9>.

Step 3: Count the number of triangles:
- Total number of triangles: 2
