Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Upon analyzing the given graph, we can determine the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
