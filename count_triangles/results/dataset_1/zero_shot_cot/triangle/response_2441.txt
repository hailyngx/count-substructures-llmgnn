Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5.

Now, let's list the unique triangles present in this graph:
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
