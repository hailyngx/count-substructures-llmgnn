Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of triangles using the adjacency matrix.

The adjacency matrix for the given graph with 10 nodes can be represented as:

```
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
```

By multiplying the adjacency matrix by itself (A^2) and the original adjacency matrix (A), we obtain:

```
A^2:
2 0 1 1 0 2 0 0 1 0
0 3 0 1 0 0 2 0 1 0
1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 3 0 3 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 0 0 3 0 4 1 0 2 0
0 2 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
1 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 3 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A:
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
0 1 0 0
