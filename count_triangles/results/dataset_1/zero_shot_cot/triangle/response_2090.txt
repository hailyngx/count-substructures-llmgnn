Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Look for triangles - a triangle is formed when there are three nodes connected to each other. Let's check each combination of three nodes to see if they form a triangle:

   - <0, 1, 6>
   - <0, 1, 7>
   - <0, 1, 8>
   - <0, 1, 9>
   - <0, 2, 6>
   - <0, 2, 7>
   - <1, 2, 6>
   - <1, 2, 7>
   - <1, 3, 4>
   - <1, 3, 6>
   - <1, 3, 7>
   - <1, 4, 6>
   - <1, 4, 9>
   - <1, 6, 9>
   - <1, 7, 9>
   - <2, 3, 7>
   - <2, 4, 6>
   - <3, 4, 6>
   - <4, 6, 9>
   - <4, 7, 9>
   - <6, 7, 9>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 21, which can also be listed as follows:
[<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>]
