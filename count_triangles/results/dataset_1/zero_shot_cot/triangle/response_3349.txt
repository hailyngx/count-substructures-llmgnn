Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. We can calculate the number of triangles by examining each possible combination of 3 nodes and checking if there is an edge between every pair of nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, we find the following triangles:
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
These are the only triangles present in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
