Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Node 0 is connected to node 1 and node 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 0 and node 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 6.
4. Node 4 is connected to node 6 and node 9.
5. Node 5 is connected to node 9.
6. Node 6 is connected to node 2 and node 4.
7. Node 8 is connected to node 0 and node 9.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 8.

Let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <1, 9, 4>
3. <6, 2, 4>
4. <9, 8, 0>
5. <9, 8, 1>
6. <9, 8, 4>
7. <9, 1, 0>
8. <9, 1, 4>
9. <9, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **9**. [9]
