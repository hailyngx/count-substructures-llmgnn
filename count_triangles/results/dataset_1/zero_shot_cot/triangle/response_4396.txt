Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 2, 3, and 5.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 7 and 9.
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with node 3.
4. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 7.
5. Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 6 and 7.
6. Node 9 forms a triangle with node 5.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, and <5, 6, 7>.
