Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Write down the adjacency list for the given graph -  
0: 8  
1: 4, 5, 6  
2: 6  
3: 8  
4: 1, 6, 7, 9  
5: 1  
6: 1, 2, 4  
7: 4  
8: 0, 3  
9: 4  

Step 2: Count the number of triangles by checking all possible triangles formed by each node -  
Triangles:  
<1, 4, 6>  
<4, 6, 1>  

Step 3: Output the total number of triangles in brackets -
