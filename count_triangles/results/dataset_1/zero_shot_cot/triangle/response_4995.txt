Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <0, 9, 4>
3. <1, 2, 5>
4. <2, 8, 9>
5. <5, 6, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [5].
