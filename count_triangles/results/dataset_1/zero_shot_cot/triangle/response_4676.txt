Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list out the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 6, 2>
3. <0, 6, 3>
4. <0, 6, 4>
5. <1, 2, 6>
6. <1, 3, 7>
7. <1, 3, 8>
8. <2, 6, 3>
9. <3, 4, 8>
10. <3, 6, 7>
11. <3, 6, 8>
12. <3, 7, 9>
13. <4, 6, 8>
14. <6, 7, 8>
15. <6, 7, 9>
16. <7, 8, 9>

There are a total of 16 triangles in the given graph, which we denote as [16].
