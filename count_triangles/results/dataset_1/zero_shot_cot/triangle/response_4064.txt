Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Analyzing the given graph, we can determine the number of triangles and list them as follows:

1. Triangles:
- <1, 2, 7>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
