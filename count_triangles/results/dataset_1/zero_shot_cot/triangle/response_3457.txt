Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangles involving node 0:  
   - (0, 1, 6)  
   - (0, 6, 7)  
   - (0, 6, 8)

2. Triangles involving node 3:  
   - (3, 4, 5)  
   - (3, 4, 7)  

3. Triangles involving node 4:  
   - (4, 6, 8)  

There are no other triangles in this graph. Thus, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4]. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, and <3, 4, 5>.
