Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: For each node, list all the neighbors.  

- Node 0: 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Step 2: Count the number of triangles by examining all possible triangles in the graph.

- Triangles involving node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 5)
- Triangles involving node 2: (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 5), (2, 5, 8)
- Triangles involving node 3: None
- Triangles involving node 4: None
- Triangles involving node 5: None
- Triangles involving node 6: None
- Triangles involving node 7: None
- Triangles involving node 8: None
- Triangles involving node 9: None

Step 3: Calculate the total number of triangles.  

Total number of triangles = 3  

Therefore, the answer is:
