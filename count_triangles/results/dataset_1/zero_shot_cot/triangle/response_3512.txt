Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 3.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 3.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles in this graph:
1. <0, 5, 9>
2. <0, 5, 2>
3. <0, 5, 4>
4. <0, 5, 1>
5. <4, 1, 5>
6. <4, 1, 9>
7. <4, 5, 9>
8. <5, 1, 9>
9. <5, 9, 0>
10. <5, 9, 2>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
