Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles by looking at the connections between nodes:

1. (0, 2, 8)
2. (0, 3, 8)
3. (0, 5, 4)
4. (0, 5, 9)
5. (0, 6, 7)
6. (2, 0, 3)
7. (2, 0, 8)
8. (3, 0, 8)
9. (4, 5, 9)
10. (5, 0, 1)
11. (5, 0, 4)
12. (5, 0, 9)
13. (5, 1, 9)
14. (5, 4, 9)
15. (6, 0, 7)
16. (7, 0, 6)
17. (7, 0, 9)
18. (8, 2, 3)
19. (8, 2, 4)
20. (8, 3, 4)
21. (9, 5, 7)

Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles in the graph: [21]
