Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first list out all the triangles present in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
3. Triangle <2, 7, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 7>
5. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [6].
