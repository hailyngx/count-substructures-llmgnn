Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph contains the following triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
[Total number of triangles: 6]
