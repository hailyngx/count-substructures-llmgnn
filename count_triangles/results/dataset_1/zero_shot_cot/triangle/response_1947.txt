Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's analyze the graph step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 5.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
8. Node 7 is not part of any triangle.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle 3: <1, 2, 3>
- Triangle 4: <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle 5: <0, 6, 9>

There are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
