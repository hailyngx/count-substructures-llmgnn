Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: 3, 6, 8
Node 1: 4, 6, 9
Node 2: 4, 7
Node 3: 0
Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 8
Node 5: 4, 8
Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 8
Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 9: 1, 7

Now let's identify the triangles. A triangle exists when three nodes are connected to each other. 

Triangles:
1. <0, 6, 8>
2. <1, 6, 9>
3. <4, 6, 8>
4. <4, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [4]
