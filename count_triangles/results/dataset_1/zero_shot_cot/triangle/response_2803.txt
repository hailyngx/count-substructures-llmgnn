Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles formed by selecting three nodes that are connected to each other:
- Potential triangles: (0, 2, 4), (0, 7, 8), (2, 3, 4), (6, 7, 8)

2. For each potential triangle, check if all three edges exist:
- (0, 2, 4): (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4) - All edges exist.
- (0, 7, 8): (0, 7), (0, 8), (7, 8) - All edges exist.
- (2, 3, 4): (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4) - All edges exist.
- (6, 7, 8): (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8) - All edges exist.

3. Count the total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<6, 7, 8>
