Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will examine each unique triangle in the graph to avoid counting duplicates.

Let's list the unique triangles:
1. <1, 4, 7>
2. <1, 4, 8>
3. <1, 7, 8>
4. <3, 5, 8>
5. <1, 7, 8>

Based on the unique triangles listed above, there are [5] triangles in total in the given graph.
