Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 3, 6)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 3, 8)
3. Triangle 3: (3, 1, 4)
4. Triangle 4: (3, 2, 4)
5. Triangle 5: (3, 6, 7)

Counting the identified triangles, we found 5 triangles in total. So, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
