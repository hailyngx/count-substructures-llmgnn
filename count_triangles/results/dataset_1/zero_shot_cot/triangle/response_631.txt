Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for unique sets of three vertices that are all connected to each other forming a triangle.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 7, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
6. Triangle <4, 2, 8>
7. Triangle <6, 0, 1>
8. Triangle <6, 1, 9>
9. Triangle <6, 7, 2>
10. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
11. Triangle <6, 9, 8>
12. Triangle <7, 2, 8>
13. Triangle <8, 2, 9>

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [13].
