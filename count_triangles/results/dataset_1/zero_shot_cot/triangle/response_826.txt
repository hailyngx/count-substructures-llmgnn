Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14]. 
The unique triangles found are: <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 3>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 7, 1>, <5, 6, 3>, <6, 7, 1>, and <8, 5, 2>.
