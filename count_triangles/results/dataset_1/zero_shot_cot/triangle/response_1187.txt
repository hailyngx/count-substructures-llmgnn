Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. We identify all the triangles based on the given edges:
   - <1, 2, 5>
   - <1, 8, 9>
   - <2, 5, 6>
   - <5, 3, 8>
   - <5, 8, 1>
   - <5, 8, 9>
2. Count the total number of triangles: [6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
