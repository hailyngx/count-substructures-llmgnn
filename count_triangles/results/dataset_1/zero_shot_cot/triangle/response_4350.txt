Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Let's list out the unique triangles found in this graph:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <1, 5, 7>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <2, 3, 5>
5. <2, 4, 5>
6. <3, 4, 6>
7. <4, 5, 8>
8. <5, 7, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
