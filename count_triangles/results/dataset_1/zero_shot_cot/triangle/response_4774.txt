Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Here are the steps to determine the total number of triangles in this graph:

1. Identify triangles:
   - Go through each node and check for triangles formed by the edges between them. For example, for node 0, check if there are edges connecting its neighbors in all possible combinations to form a triangle.
   
2. Count the triangles:
   - List out the unique triangles you find while going through all nodes.
   
3. Calculate the total number of triangles:
   - Count the total number of unique triangles found in the graph.

Let's follow these steps to count the total number of triangles in the given graph showing the unique triangles in < >:
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 7>

Now, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
