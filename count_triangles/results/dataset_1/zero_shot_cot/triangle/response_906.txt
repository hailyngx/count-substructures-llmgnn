Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is a set of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. (0, 5, 8)
2. (1, 3, 4)
3. (1, 5, 8)
4. (1, 6, 8)
5. (3, 6, 8)
6. (5, 6, 8)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>
