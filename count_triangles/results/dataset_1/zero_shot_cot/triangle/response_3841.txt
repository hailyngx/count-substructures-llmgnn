Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's start by identifying the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <3, 4, 8>

Count of triangles: [3]
