Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify all the unique triangles by examining each combination of three nodes connected by edges.

### Let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 2: <1, 3, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle 4: <2, 3, 8>
- Triangle 5: <3, 6, 7>

### Total Number of Triangles: [5]
