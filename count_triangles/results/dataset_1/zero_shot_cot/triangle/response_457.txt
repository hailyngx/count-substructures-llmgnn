Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find these triangles:

1. Triangle 1: (1, 5, 6)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 6, 9)
3. Triangle 3: (2, 5, 6)
4. Triangle 4: (3, 2, 5)
5. Triangle 5: (4, 6, 9)

So, there are 5 triangles in total. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
