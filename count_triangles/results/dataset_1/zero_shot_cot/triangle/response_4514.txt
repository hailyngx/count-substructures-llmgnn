Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to consider all possible combinations of 3 nodes that form triangles. We will check each combination of three nodes to see if they are connected by edges.

Starting with the provided graph and based on the edges given, we can see the following triangles:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <0, 4, 8>
5. <0, 4, 9>
6. <1, 7, 2>
7. <1, 7, 4>
8. <1, 9, 2>
9. <1, 9, 5>
10. <2, 7, 4>
11. <2, 7, 8>
12. <2, 7, 9>
13. <2, 8, 9>
14. <3, 4, 6>
15. <4, 7, 6>
16. <4, 7, 8>
17. <4, 7, 9>
18. <4, 8, 9>
19. <7, 8, 9>

Hence, there are a total of [19] triangles in the given graph.
