Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first find the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. For each node, find the neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 3, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 1: Neighbors are 5, 9.
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 3, 5, 7.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 7.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 3, 9.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 9.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 7, 8, 9.
- Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 3, 6.
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 6.
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6.

2. Check for triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 3> exists.
- Triangle <0, 2, 5> exists.
- Triangle <0, 5, 9> exists.
- Triangle <2, 3, 7> exists.
- Triangle <3, 4, 9> exists.
- Triangle <6, 7, 9> exists.

Now, let's count the number of unique triangles found in the graph:
