Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we need to count the number of triangles in the graph.

A triangle is a set of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes. To find triangles, we need to look for sets of three nodes where all three possible edges between those nodes exist.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
2. Triangle <2, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
