Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 6>
