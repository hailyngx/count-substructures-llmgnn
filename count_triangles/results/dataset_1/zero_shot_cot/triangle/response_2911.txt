Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 8.

Next, we will identify the triangles:

1. <0, 5, 1>
2. <0, 5, 2>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <0, 6, 3>
5. <0, 8, 1>
6. <0, 8, 3>
7. <0, 8, 4>
8. <1, 5, 2>
9. <1, 5, 7>
10. <1, 5, 9>
11. <1, 8, 3>
12. <1, 8, 4>
13. <1, 8, 9>
14. <2, 5, 9>
15. <3, 4, 8>
16. <5, 7, 1>
17. <5, 9, 1>
18. <8, 9, 1>

Therefore, there are 18 triangles in the given graph. The answer is [18].
