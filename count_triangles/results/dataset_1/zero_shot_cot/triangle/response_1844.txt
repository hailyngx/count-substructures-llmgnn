Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges provided.

Let's list all the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <4, 5, 6>
5. <4, 5, 8>
6. <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
