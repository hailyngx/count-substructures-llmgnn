Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Firstly, let's identify the triangles in the given graph by looking for nodes that are interconnected in a triangle formation. A triangle consists of three nodes connected to each other forming a closed loop.

By examining the given edges, we can identify the following triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <1, 6, 5>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <4, 5, 8>
7. <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the total number of triangles is [7].
