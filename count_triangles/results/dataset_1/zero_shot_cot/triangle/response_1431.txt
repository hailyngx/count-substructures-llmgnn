Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <0, 6, 7>
5. <2, 5, 7>
6. <4, 5, 7>
7. <0, 8, 9>
8. <2, 8, 9>
9. <5, 6, 7>
10. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
