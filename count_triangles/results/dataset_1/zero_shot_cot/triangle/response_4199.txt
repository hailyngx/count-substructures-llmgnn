Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 3, 6, and 1.
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 7.
3. Node 2 does not form any triangles.
4. Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 0, 1, and 6.
5. Node 4 does not form any triangles.
6. Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, and 7.
7. Node 7 forms triangles with nodes 1, 3, 6, and 8.
8. Node 8 does not form any triangles.
9. Node 9 does not form any triangles.

Now, let's list the unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 1>
<3, 1, 7>
<3, 6, 7>

As each triangle was listed only once, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
