Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify the triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles:

1. <2, 3, 8>
2. <2, 4, 8>
3. <3, 4, 8>
4. <2, 3, 9>
5. <4, 6, 9>
6. <7, 9, 6>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
