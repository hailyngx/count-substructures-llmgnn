Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 5
- Node 3: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 2
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 1
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 4

Step 2: Count the number of triangles.
To find triangles, we look for nodes that have common neighbors. Triangles in a graph are formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Triangular relationships in this graph:
<0, 2, 5>   
<1, 2, 8>   
<1, 2, 9>   
<2, 3, 5>   
<2, 8, 9>   

Step 3: Calculate the total number of triangles.
There are a total of [5] triangles in this graph.
