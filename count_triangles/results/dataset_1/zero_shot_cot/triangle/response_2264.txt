Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify Triangles
1. Triangles are formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other (i.e., each node is connected to the other two nodes in the triangle).
2. We will iterate through all possible combinations of three connected nodes to identify triangles in the graph.

### Step 2: Counting Triangles
1. From the given edges, we can identify the triangles present in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <2, 4, 9>
   - Triangle 3: <2, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 4: <2, 5, 3>
   - Triangle 5: <4, 7, 9>

### Step 3: Output
1. The total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
2. The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 3>, <4, 7, 9>.
