Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node in the graph.
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles in the graph.
- Pick a node (let's start with node 0): Node 0 is connected to node 3 and 8.
    - Check if there is a triangle involving node 0, 3, and 8. Since node 3 and 8 are not directly connected, there is no triangle involving node 0 in this step.
- Repeat this process for other nodes. (Nodes 1 to 9)
    
After calculating, we find the total number of triangles in the graph is [1]. 

The unique triangle found in the graph is <7, 4, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
