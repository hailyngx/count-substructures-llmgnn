Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 4.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle 2: <1, 3, 9>
3. Triangle 3: <1, 4, 9>

Count of triangles: [3]
