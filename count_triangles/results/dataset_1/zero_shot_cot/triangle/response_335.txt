Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Nodes connected in a triangle:
   - (0, 5, 7)
   - (2, 4, 5)
   - (2, 5, 8)
   - (4, 5, 7)
   - (4, 5, 8)

Now we can count the total number of triangles inside brackets [] as shown earlier.
