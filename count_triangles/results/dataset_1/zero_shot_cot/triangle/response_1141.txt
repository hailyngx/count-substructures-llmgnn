Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three vertices that are mutually adjacent. A triangle consists of three vertices where each vertex is connected to the other two vertices.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <3, 4, 6>
4. <3, 4, 8>
5. <3, 5, 8>
6. <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
