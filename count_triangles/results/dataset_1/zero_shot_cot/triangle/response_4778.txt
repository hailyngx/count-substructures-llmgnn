Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for cycles of length 3 among the nodes. We will check each possible combination of 3 nodes to see if they form a triangle. 

Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
