Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 4
- Node 9: 4

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles.
- For a triangle to exist, a vertex must have two neighbors that are also connected. We can identify triangles based on nodes that have at least two common neighbors.

Step 3: Identify the triangles.
- Based on the given edges, the triangles are:
    1. <0, 2, 7>
    2. <0, 2, 6>
    3. <0, 2, 9>
    4. <0, 3, 9>
    5. <1, 4, 7>
    6. <1, 9, 2>
    7. <1, 9, 3>
    8. <2, 5, 6>
    9. <2, 7, 4>
    10. <3, 9, 2>
    11. <9, 2, 7>

Step 4: Count the total number of triangles.
- Total number of triangles: [11]
