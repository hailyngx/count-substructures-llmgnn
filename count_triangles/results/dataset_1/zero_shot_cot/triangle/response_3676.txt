Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that form triangles when connected.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

Let's follow these steps:

Possible triangles with their respective nodes:
1. (0, 1, 2)
2. (0, 1, 6)
3. (1, 2, 6)
4. (2, 3, 6)
5. (3, 4, 6)
6. (3, 6, 8)

Count of unique triangles: [6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
