Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other in a triangle formation.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 7, 5>
2. <0, 7, 6>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <2, 4, 8>
5. <5, 6, 7>
6. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
