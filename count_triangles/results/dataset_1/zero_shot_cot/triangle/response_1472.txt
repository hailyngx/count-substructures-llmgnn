Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the nodes. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes connected in a closed loop.

Let's look at each possible triangle combination:

1. Triangle formed by nodes {0, 2, 4}
2. Triangle formed by nodes {0, 4, 5}
3. Triangle formed by nodes {0, 8, 5}
4. Triangle formed by nodes {1, 4, 7}
5. Triangle formed by nodes {0, 5, 8}
6. Triangle formed by nodes {3, 4, 7}
7. Triangle formed by nodes {3, 6, 7}
8. Triangle formed by nodes {4, 6, 9}

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
