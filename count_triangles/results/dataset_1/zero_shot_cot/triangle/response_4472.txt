Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the given edges.

Upon examining the connections between nodes based on the provided edges, we can list the following unique triangles:

1. <0, 5, 2>
2. <0, 7, 4>
3. <1, 3, 6>
4. <2, 5, 0>
5. <2, 6, 3>
6. <2, 6, 1>
7. <2, 6, 3>
8. <2, 8, 3>
9. <3, 6, 1>
10. <3, 6, 2>
11. <3, 8, 2>
12. <5, 0, 7>
13. <6, 1, 3>
14. <6, 2, 5>
15. <6, 3, 8>

Counting the unique triangles obtained above, we find that there are 15 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
