Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Node 0 forms triangles with the following pairs of nodes: (2, 4), (4, 9). So, the triangles involving Node 0 are <0, 2, 4> and <0, 4, 9>.

2. Node 2 forms triangles with the following pairs of nodes: (4, 0), (4, 7). So, the triangles involving Node 2 are <0, 2, 4> and <2, 4, 7>.

3. Node 3 forms a triangle with the nodes: 4, 6. So, the triangle involving Node 3 is <3, 4, 6>.

4. Node 4 forms triangles with the following pairs of nodes: (0, 2), (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 9). So, the triangles involving Node 4 are <0, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 7>, and <3, 4, 6>.

5. Node 6 forms a triangle with the nodes: 3, 4. So, the triangle involving Node 6 is <3, 4, 6>.

6. No triangles are formed by Nodes 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9 within the given edges.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
