Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are interconnected by edges.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. <0, 7, 4>
2. <2, 3, 5>
3. <2, 3, 6>
4. <2, 3, 9>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <3, 4, 7>
7. <3, 4, 9>
8. <4, 6, 8>
9. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
