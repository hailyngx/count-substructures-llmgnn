Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's examine each node and its neighbors to identify the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 9. The triangle <0, 4, 9> is found.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 5. No triangle is formed with node 1.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6. The triangle <2, 4, 6> is found.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 9. No triangle is formed with node 3.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9. Two triangles are found: <0, 2, 4> and <0, 4, 9>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. No triangle is formed with node 5.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 7. No triangle is formed with node 6.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 6. No triangle is formed with node 7.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 5. No triangle is formed with node 8.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4. One triangle is found: <0, 3, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
