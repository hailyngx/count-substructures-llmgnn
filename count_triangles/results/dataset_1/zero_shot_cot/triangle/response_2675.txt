Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, and <6, 8, 9>.
