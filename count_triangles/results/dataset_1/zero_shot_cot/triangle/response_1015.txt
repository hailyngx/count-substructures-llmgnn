Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

### Step 1:
Identify the triangles by finding nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular manner.

### Step 2:
List of triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 6, 9>

### Total number of triangles: [4]
