Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will go through each possible triangle in the graph:

1. Possible triangles including node 0:  
- <0, 2, 5>  
- <0, 8, 9>

2. Possible triangles including node 1:  
No triangles with node 1 as all its connections have already been considered.

3. Possible triangles including node 2:  
No new triangles with node 2 as all its connections have been considered.

4. Possible triangles including node 3:  
No triangles with node 3 as all its connections have already been considered.

5. Possible triangles including node 4:  
No triangles with node 4 as all its connections have already been considered.

6. Possible triangles including node 5:  
- <0, 2, 5>  

7. Possible triangles including node 6:  
No triangles with node 6 as all its connections have already been considered.

8. Possible triangles including node 7:  
No new triangles with node 7 as all its connections have been considered.

9. Possible triangles including node 8:  
- <0, 8, 9>

10. Possible triangles including node 9:  
No new triangles with node 9 as all its connections have been considered.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5> and <0, 8, 9>.  

Thus, the answer is:
