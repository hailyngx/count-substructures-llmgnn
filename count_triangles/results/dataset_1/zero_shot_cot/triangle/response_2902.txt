Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here is the breakdown:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5.

By looking at the connections, we can determine the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
