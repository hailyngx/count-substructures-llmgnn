Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 3, 2>
4. <0, 5, 4>

Count of triangles: [4]
