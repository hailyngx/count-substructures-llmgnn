Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are interconnected. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 3. Therefore, there is a triangle involving nodes 0, 2, and 3. <0, 2, 3>
2. Node 0 is connected to node 8 and node 8 is connected to node 8 itself. Therefore, there is a triangle involving nodes 0, 8, and 8. <0, 8, 8>
3. Node 0 is connected to node 8 and 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 6. There is a triangle involving nodes 0, 2, and 6. <0, 2, 6>
4. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8. There is a triangle involving nodes 2, 5, and 8. <2, 5, 8>
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9, and node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6. There is a triangle involving nodes 5, 9, and 6. <5, 9, 6>
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7. There is a triangle involving nodes 8, 0, and 2. <8, 0, 2>
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6. There is a triangle involving nodes 9, 1, and 3. <9, 1, 3>
8. Node 9 is also connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6. There is a triangle involving nodes 9, 5, and 6. <9, 5, 6>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 8, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 8, 8>, <0, 2, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <5, 9, 6>, <8, 0, 2>, <9, 1, 3>, <9, 5, 6>. Therefore, the answer is [8].
