Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we'll need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. First, let's list all the triangles present in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 4, 7>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 4, 8>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 5, 3>
   - Triangle 4: <2, 7, 4>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 7, 8>
   - Triangle 6: <3, 1, 5>
   - Triangle 7: <3, 4, 8>
   - Triangle 8: <3, 7, 8>

2. Counting the total number of unique triangles, we find there are 8 triangles in total. Therefore, the output will be:
   [8]
