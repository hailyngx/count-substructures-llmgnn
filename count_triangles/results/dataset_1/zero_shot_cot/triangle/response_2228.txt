Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles formed by the edges provided. 

Let's list the triangles below:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 6, 2>
<4, 2, 7>
<4, 5, 3>
<8, 4, 5>
<9, 2, 3>
[Total number of triangles: 11]
