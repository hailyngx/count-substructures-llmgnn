Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <1, 2, 5>
3. <1, 2, 8>
4. <1, 3, 4>
5. <1, 6, 9>
6. <2, 7, 8>
7. <2, 8, 5>
8. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
