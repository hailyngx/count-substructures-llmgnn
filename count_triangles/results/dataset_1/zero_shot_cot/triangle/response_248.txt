Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 4, 5>
4. <1, 4, 5>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <6, 4, 5>
7. <8, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
