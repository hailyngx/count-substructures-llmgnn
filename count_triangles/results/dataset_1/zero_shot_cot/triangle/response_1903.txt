Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.

Now, let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <1, 2, 3>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <1, 6, 3>
5. <3, 4, 7>
6. <4, 9, 5>
7. <8, 9, 4>

So, there are a total of 7 triangles in the graph. 

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [7].
