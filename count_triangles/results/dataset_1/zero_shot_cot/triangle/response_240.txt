Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify all possible triangles by checking which nodes have edges connecting them. Then we count the total number of triangles formed. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes connected by edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to node 4.

2. Identify the triangles (nodes forming triangles) in the graph:
- <0, 5, 3>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <2, 1, 4>
- <2, 4, 8>

3. Count the total number of triangles: [5]

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
