Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges provided. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 3>
5. Triangle <1, 2, 9>
6. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
7. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
8. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
9. Triangle <6, 7, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
