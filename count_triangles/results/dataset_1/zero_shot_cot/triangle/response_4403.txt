Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Counting the number of triangles in a graph can be done by examining each set of three nodes and checking if there is an edge between each pair of nodes in that set. Let's find the total number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles present in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: (1, 2, 4)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 2, 6)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 2, 8)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 4, 8)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 4, 8)
   
2. Count the total number of unique triangles: [5]

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, and <2, 4, 8>.
