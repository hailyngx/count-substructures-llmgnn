Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's simplify the given graph information:

0 -> 2, 3, 5, 7
1 -> 8
2 -> 0, 8
3 -> 0, 5, 7, 8
4 -> 8
5 -> 0, 3, 9
6 -> 9
7 -> 0, 3, 8
8 -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
9 -> 5, 6

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph. A triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - <0, 2, 3>
   - <0, 3, 5>
   - <0, 3, 7>

2. Triangle involving node 2:
   - <2, 0, 8>

3. Triangles involving node 3:
   - <3, 0, 5>
   - <3, 0, 7>
   - <3, 5, 7>
   - <3, 7, 8>

4. Triangle involving node 5:
   - <5, 0, 3>

5. No triangles involving nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
