Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9.
   - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 1>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 4, 9>

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
   - No additional triangles.

3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
   - No triangles can be formed yet.

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
   - No additional triangles.

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
   - No triangles can be formed yet.

6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
   - No triangles can be formed yet.

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
   - Triangle 3: <3, 5, 7>
   - Triangle 4: <5, 6, 7>

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
   - No triangles can be formed yet.

9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
   - No additional triangles.

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph.
Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is **[4]**.
