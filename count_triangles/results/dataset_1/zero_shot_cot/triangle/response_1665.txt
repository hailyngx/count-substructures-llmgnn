Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in this graph. Here they are:

[<0, 2, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 0>]
