Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can consider each possible triangle formed by three nodes in the graph and check if there is an edge between each pair of nodes in the triangle.

Let's list down the possible triangles based on the given edges:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <1, 0, 3>
4. <2, 6, 7>
5. <6, 7, 8>

Counting the total number of triangles, we find that there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
