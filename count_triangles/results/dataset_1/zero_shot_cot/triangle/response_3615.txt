Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can first identify the triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected with each other. Let's list the triangles:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <1, 5, 6>
4. <1, 5, 8>
5. <1, 6, 7>
6. <1, 7, 9>
7. <3, 4, 9>
8. <5, 6, 8>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
