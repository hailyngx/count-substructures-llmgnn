Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each set of three nodes and check if they form a triangle. A triangle is formed when each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
