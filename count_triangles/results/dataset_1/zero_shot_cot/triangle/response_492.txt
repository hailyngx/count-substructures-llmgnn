Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for triangles formed by 3 connected nodes. 
Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Possible triangles involving node 0: (0, 2, 8), (0, 2, 9), (0, 7, 8), (0, 7, 9)
2. Possible triangles involving node 1: (1, 4, 7), (1, 4, 9), (1, 7, 9)
3. Possible triangles involving node 2: None
4. Possible triangles involving node 3: (3, 4, 6), (3, 4, 9), (3, 6, 8), (3, 6, 9)
5. Possible triangles involving node 4: None
6. Possible triangles involving node 6: (6, 7, 8), (6, 7, 9), (6, 8, 9)
7. Possible triangles involving node 7: None
8. Possible triangles involving node 8: None
9. Possible triangles involving node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 10. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>. 
So, the total number of triangles is [10].
