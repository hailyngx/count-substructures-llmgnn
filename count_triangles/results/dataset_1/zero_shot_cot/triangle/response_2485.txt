Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by listing the triangles found in the graph. 

Triangles:
1. <1, 6, 9>
2. <1, 8, 9>
3. <6, 0, 1>
4. <6, 1, 2>
5. <6, 1, 3>
6. <6, 2, 3>
7. <9, 3, 4>
8. <9, 3, 7>
9. <9, 4, 7>
10. <9, 7, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [10]
