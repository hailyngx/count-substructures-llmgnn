Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes connected by edges. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. <1, 2, 8>
2. <1, 4, 6>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <1, 8, 9>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <4, 6, 7>
7. <4, 7, 6>
8. <6, 7, 8>
9. <8, 9, 1>

There are 9 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
