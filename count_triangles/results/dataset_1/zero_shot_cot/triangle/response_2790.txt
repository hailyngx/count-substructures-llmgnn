Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles in the graph step-by-step and then count them:

- Triangle 1: <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle 2: <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle 4: <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle 5: <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle 6: <2, 7, 4>
- Triangle 7: <4, 7, 9>
- Triangle 8: <6, 8, 1>
- Triangle 9: <6, 8, 2>
- Triangle 10: <6, 8, 9>
- Triangle 11: <6, 9, 1>
- Triangle 12: <6, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
