Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. 

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 6, 2>
4. <0, 7, 4>
5. <1, 2, 3>
6. <1, 7, 4>
7. <3, 2, 6>
8. <5, 4, 9>
9. <5, 8, 9>
10. <7, 4, 9>

There are total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
