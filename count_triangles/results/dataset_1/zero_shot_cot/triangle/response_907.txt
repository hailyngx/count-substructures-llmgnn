Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other in the graph.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 7>
6. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
8. Triangle <4, 6, 8>
9. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
10. Triangle <5, 6, 8>

So, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
