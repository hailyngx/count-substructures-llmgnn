Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify the triangles by observing the nodes that are interconnected with each other via edges. In a triangle, each node is connected to the other two nodes forming a closed loop.

After examining the edges provided, we can determine the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <2, 3, 4>
5. <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
