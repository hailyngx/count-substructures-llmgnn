Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 12 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 9>. So, the total number of triangles is [12].
