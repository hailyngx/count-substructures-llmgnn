Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges with each other forming a closed triangle.

Given the edges:
(0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 4), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (9, 1)

Let's find the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 1>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 4>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 0>
5. Triangle <1, 9, 2>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [7]
