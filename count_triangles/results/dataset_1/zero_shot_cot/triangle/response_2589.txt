Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:
    1: 4, 8
    2: 6
    4: 1, 5
    5: 4, 8
    6: 2, 7
    7: 6
    8: 1, 5

Next, let's count the number of triangles:
1. Look for nodes that have common neighbors. Calculate the number of triangles they form.
2. Do this for all sets of three nodes that have common neighbors. 

Let's start counting the triangles using the given graph data.
