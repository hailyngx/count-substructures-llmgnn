Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's count the number of triangles present.

To count the triangles in a graph, we need to identify all the triplets of nodes that are connected to each other. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other, creating a closed loop.

In this graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
8. Node 8 is connected to node 6.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 2: <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle 3: <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle 4: <1, 6, 7>
- Triangle 5: <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle 6: <3, 5, 7>

Counting the triangles, we have found 6 triangles. So, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
