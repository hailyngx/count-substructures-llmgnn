Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.

Now, let's find the triangles:

- Triangle <1, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle <2, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 4. So, the output is [4].
