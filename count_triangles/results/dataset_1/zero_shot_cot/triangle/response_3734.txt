Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are each connected to each other.

Let's begin by listing all the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <2, 3, 4>
4. <2, 3, 6>
5. <2, 4, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
