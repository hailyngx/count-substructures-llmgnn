Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's write down the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:
Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 1: 0, 6, 7
Node 2: 0
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 8
Node 5: 0, 3, 6
Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 7
Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 9
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 0, 7

Now, let's analyze the triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's list the unique triangles below:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 7, 9>

Counting the number of unique triangles gives us 2. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
