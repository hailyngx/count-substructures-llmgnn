Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here's how we can approach this step-by-step:

1. Count the triangles:
   - <2, 4, 5>
   - <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
