Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected with each other. Here are the triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 2, 7>
4. <0, 7, 8>
5. <1, 2, 7>
6. <2, 7, 9>
7. <2, 8, 9>
8. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
