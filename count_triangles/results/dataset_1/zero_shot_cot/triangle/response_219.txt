Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by cycles of length 3. We will iterate through every triplet of nodes and check if they form a triangle by checking if there are edges between every pair of nodes in the triplet.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph along with their node numbers:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<7, 9, 4>

Total number of triangles: [7]
