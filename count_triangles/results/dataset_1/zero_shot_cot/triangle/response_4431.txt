Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 3.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 1.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 2.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 0.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <1, 2, 4>
- <2, 4, 9>
- These are the only two triangles in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
