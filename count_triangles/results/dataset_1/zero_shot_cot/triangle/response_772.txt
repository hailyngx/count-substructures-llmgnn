Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, and 3.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 2 and 9.
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with node 8.
4. Node 3 forms a triangle with node 4.
5. Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 5 and 7.
6. Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 7 and 8.
7. Node 9 forms a triangle with node 8.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <1, 2, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, and <8, 9, 5>.
