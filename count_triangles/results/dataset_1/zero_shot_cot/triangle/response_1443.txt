Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are fully connected with each other.

Let's identify the triangles in this graph:
1. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
2. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 4>
4. Triangle <2, 9, 5>
5. Triangle <4, 6, 2>
6. Triangle <5, 8, 7>
7. Triangle <5, 8, 9>
8. Triangle <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
