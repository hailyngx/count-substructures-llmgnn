Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. In this case, we will look for triangles by examining all possible combinations of three nodes connected by edges.

Let's list down the triangles present in the graph:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
