Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by three connected nodes.

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
