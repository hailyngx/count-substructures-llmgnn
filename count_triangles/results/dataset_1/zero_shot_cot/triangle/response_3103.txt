Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for interconnected sets of three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly.

Let's list down the triangles in the graph:
1. <1, 5, 6>
2. <1, 5, 9>
3. <1, 6, 9>
4. <2, 1, 9>
5. <4, 5, 6>
6. <4, 5, 7>
7. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
