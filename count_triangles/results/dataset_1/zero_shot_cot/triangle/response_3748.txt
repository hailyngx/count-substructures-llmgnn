Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <8, 9, 1>.
