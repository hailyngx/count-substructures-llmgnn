Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the nodes and check if there are edges connecting each trio of nodes.

Given the list of edges:

(0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1)

Let's analyze the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <1, 4, 7> is formed by nodes 1, 4, and 7. (1, 4), (1, 7), and (4, 7) exist.
2. Triangle <1, 4, 8> is formed by nodes 1, 4, and 8. (1, 4), (1, 8), and (4, 8) exist.
3. Triangle <1, 7, 8> is formed by nodes 1, 7, and 8. (1, 7), (1, 8), and (7, 8) exist.
4. Triangle <2, 3, 7> is formed by nodes 2, 3, and 7. (2, 3), (2, 7), and (3, 7) exist.
5. Triangle <3, 4, 7> is formed by nodes 3, 4, and 7. (3, 4), (3, 7), and (4, 7) exist.
6. Triangle <3, 4, 8> is formed by nodes 3, 4, and 8. (3, 4), (3, 8), and (4, 8) exist.
7. Triangle <3, 7, 8> is formed by nodes 3, 7, and 8. (3, 7), (3, 8), and (7, 8) exist.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
