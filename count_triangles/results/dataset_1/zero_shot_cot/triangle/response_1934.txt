Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges provided. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
4. Triangle <5, 0, 8>
5. Triangle <6, 3, 7>
6. Triangle <6, 4, 9>
7. Triangle <7, 3, 9>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
