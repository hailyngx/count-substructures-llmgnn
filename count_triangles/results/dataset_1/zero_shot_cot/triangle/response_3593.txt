Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all the triangles by checking for each possible triangle combination among the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 1, 9>
4. <0, 5, 6>
5. <3, 6, 8>

There are [5] triangles in total in the given graph.
