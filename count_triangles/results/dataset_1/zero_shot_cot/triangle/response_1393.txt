Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of nodes that are interconnected in a triangle formation.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
7. Node 8 is connected to node 0.
8. Node 9 is connected to node 1.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 3: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 4: <1, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
