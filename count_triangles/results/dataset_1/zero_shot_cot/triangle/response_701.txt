Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the nodes based on the given edges. Let's go step-by-step to find out the total number of triangles in this graph:

1. Identify the triangles:
   - Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
     - <0, 6, 2>
     - <1, 7, 2>
     - <1, 7, 4>
     - <1, 8, 6>
     - <3, 4, 7>

2. Counting the number of unique triangles:
   - There are 5 unique triangles in total based on the identified combinations.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
