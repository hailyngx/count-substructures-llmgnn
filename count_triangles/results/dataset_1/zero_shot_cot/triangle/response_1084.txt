Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in a graph, we need to identify the sets of three vertices that are all connected to each other. Each such set forms a triangle. Let's list down the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <1, 2, 5>
4. <1, 2, 7>
5. <1, 5, 7>
6. <2, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
