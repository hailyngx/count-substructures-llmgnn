Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze each possible triangle formed by 3 nodes. Since counting all triangles manually can be time-consuming, let's simplify the process.

Let's denote the 10 nodes as {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. To form a triangle, we need to find sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. For each edge (i, j), we check if there is another edge (j, k) and (k, i). If yes, then we have found a triangle.

Now, let's list out the triangles we find while going through each combination:

1. <2, 4, 7>
2. <2, 4, 9>
3. <3, 4, 7>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <6, 0, 1>
6. <6, 0, 3>
7. <6, 1, 3>
8. <8, 1, 2>
9. <8, 1, 9>
10. <8, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
