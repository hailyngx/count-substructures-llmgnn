Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected. 

Here are the triangles present in the given graph:
1. <1, 4, 9>
2. <2, 4, 9>
3. <2, 5, 7>
4. <2, 5, 3>
5. <3, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
