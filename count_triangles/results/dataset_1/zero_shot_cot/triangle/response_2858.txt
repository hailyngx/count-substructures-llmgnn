Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. We will list the triangles below:

- <1, 2, 8>
- <2, 8, 9>
- <8, 9, 2>
- <1, 8, 2>
- <1, 8, 7>
- <1, 8, 4>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <8, 4, 7>
- <1, 0, 2>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <8, 7, 4>
- <4, 8, 2>
- <2, 9, 5>
- <6, 9, 5>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
