Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles by checking for each node pair if they share a common neighbor.

- For node pair (0, 2): common neighbor is 3, so triangle formed is <0, 2, 3>.
- For node pair (0, 3): common neighbors are 2 and 9, so triangles formed are <0, 3, 2> and <0, 3, 9>.
- For node pair (0, 7): no triangle formed.
- For node pair (0, 8): common neighbor is 9, so triangle formed is <0, 8, 9>.
- For node pair (0, 9): no triangle formed.

- For node pair (1, 3): no triangle formed.
- For node pair (1, 4): no triangle formed.
- For node pair (1, 6): no triangle formed.

- For node pair (2, 3): common neighbor is 4, so triangle formed is <2, 3, 4>.
- For node pair (2, 4): no triangle formed.
- For node pair (2, 8): common neighbor is 9, so triangle formed is <2, 8, 9>.
- For node pair (2, 9): no triangle formed.

- For node pair (3, 4): common neighbor is 1, so triangle formed is <3, 4, 1>.
- For node pair (3, 9): no triangle formed.

- For node pair (4, 5): no triangle formed.
- For node pair (4, 6): no triangle formed.
- For node pair (4, 8): common neighbor is 2, so triangle formed is <4, 8, 2>.

Step 2: Summarize the unique triangles found.
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 3>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 2>
- Triangle 3: <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle 4: <0, 8, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 3, 4>
- Triangle 6: <2, 8, 9>
- Triangle 7: <3, 4, 1>
- Triangle 8: <4, 8, 2>

Total number of triangles = 8
