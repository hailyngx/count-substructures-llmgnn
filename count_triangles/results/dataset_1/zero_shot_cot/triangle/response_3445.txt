Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles by examining each combination of three nodes that are connected to each other. Then we check if the three nodes form a triangle by verifying if each pair of nodes has an edge connecting them.

Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Looking at all possible combinations of 3 nodes: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
   
2. Checking all triangles in the graph:
   
   - Triangle 1: <0, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 2, 7>
   - Triangle 3: <1, 2, 9>
   - Triangle 4: <2, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 7, 9>
   
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
