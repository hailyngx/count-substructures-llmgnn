Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to check each possible triangle formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 1, 5>
<2, 8, 4>
<2, 8, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<7, 3, 8>

There are [9] triangles in total.
