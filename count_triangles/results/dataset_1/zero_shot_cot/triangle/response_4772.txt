Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in a graph, you can use the formula:
\[ \text{Total triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i} \text{degree}(v_i) (\text{degree}(v_i) - 1) (\text{degree}(v_i) - 2) \]
where degree(\(v_i\)) represents the degree of vertex \(v_i\).

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's calculate the number of triangles step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the degree of each vertex:**
   - Node 0: degree = 3
   - Node 1: degree = 4
   - Node 2: degree = 4
   - Node 3: degree = 3
   - Node 4: degree = 3
   - Node 5: degree = 2
   - Node 6: degree = 5
   - Node 7: degree = 4
   - Node 8: degree = 2
   - Node 9: degree = 2

2. **Substitute the degree of each vertex into the formula:**
   \[ \text{Total triangles} = \frac{1}{6} \left(3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 + 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 + 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 + 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0\right) \]
   \[ = \frac{1}{6} \left(6 + 24 + 24 + 6 + 6 + 0 + 60 + 24 + 0 + 0\right) \]
   \[ = \frac{150}{6} = 25 \]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [25]. Some of the unique triangles found in the graph include <0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, and <2, 3, 9>, among others.
