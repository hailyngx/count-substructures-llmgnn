Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected forming triangles.

Let's start by listing out the triangles using the given edges:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <0, 7, 9>
3. <2, 0, 9>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <4, 5, 9>
6. <5, 6, 7>
7. <5, 6, 8>
8. <5, 7, 6>
9. <5, 7, 8>
10. <5, 8, 6>
11. <6, 7, 5>
12. <6, 7, 8>
13. <6, 8, 5>
14. <7, 0, 9>
15. <7, 5, 8>
16. <7, 6, 8>
17. <9, 0, 2>
18. <9, 0, 7>
19. <9, 3, 4>
20. <9, 4, 5>
21. <9, 4, 7>

By counting the above triangles, we find that there are a total of 21 triangles in the given graph. So, the output is [21].
