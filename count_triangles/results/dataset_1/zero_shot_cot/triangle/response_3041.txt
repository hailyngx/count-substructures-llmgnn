Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Look for triangles formed by each node:
   - Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
   - Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 2 and 7.
   - Node 2 forms a triangle with node 1.
   - Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 4, 7, and 9.
   - Node 4 forms a triangle with node 6.
   - Node 5 forms no triangles.
   - Node 6 forms no triangles.
   - Node 7 forms no new triangles.
   - Node 8 forms no triangles.
   - Node 9 forms a triangle with node 5.

2. Counting the unique triangles found:
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <0, 3, 7>
   - <0, 3, 9>
   - <0, 4, 6>
   - <0, 4, 9>
   - <0, 6, 4>
   - <0, 7, 3>
   - <0, 7, 9>
   - <0, 9, 3>
   - <4, 6, 0>
   - <5, 9, 0>
   
Therefore, there are 11 triangles in total. So, the output should be:
[11]
