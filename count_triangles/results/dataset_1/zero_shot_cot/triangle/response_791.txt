Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 1.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (1, 2, 4)
- Triangle 2: (1, 5, 6)
- Triangle 3: (1, 8, 9)
- Triangle 4: (2, 4, 1)
- Triangle 5: (5, 6, 1)
- Triangle 6: (5, 8, 1)
- Triangle 7: (6, 1, 5)
- Triangle 8: (8, 1, 5)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is **[8]**.
