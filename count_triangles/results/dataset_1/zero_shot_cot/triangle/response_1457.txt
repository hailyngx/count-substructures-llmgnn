Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we can go node by node and check for triangles involving each node. Since counting triangles manually can be time-consuming, I will write down the triangles individually and then count the number of unique triangles. Let's begin:

Triangular relationships:
- <0, 6, 8>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <3, 7, 4>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <7, 4, 9>
- <0, 7, 3> (Note: This triangle is formed using the edges (0,7), (7,3), and (3,0))

Now, let's count the number of unique triangles: [10].
