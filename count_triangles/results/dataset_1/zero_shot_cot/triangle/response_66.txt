Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

First, let's list down all the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <1, 3, 4>
5. <1, 5, 9>
6. <2, 3, 4>
7. <2, 4, 8>
8. <3, 7, 9>
9. <4, 7, 9>
10. <6, 8, 0>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
