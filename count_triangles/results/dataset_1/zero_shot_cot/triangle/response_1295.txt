Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. From the given edges, let's list out the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (2, 3, 4)
   - Triangle 2: (3, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 3: (2, 3, 5)
   - Triangle 4: (0, 7, 5)

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [4].
