Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.

Step 2: Identify the unique triangles in the graph.

Let's start with step 1:

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can use the formula:

Total number of triangles = (1/6) * Sum of (degree(v) choose 2) for all vertices v

Given the degrees of the vertices:
degree(0) = 3
degree(1) = 3
degree(2) = 3
degree(3) = 2
degree(4) = 2
degree(5) = 3
degree(6) = 2
degree(7) = 3
degree(8) = 3
degree(9) = 2

Calculating, we get:
Total number of triangles = (1/6) * [ (3 choose 2) + (3 choose 2) + (3 choose 2) + (2 choose 2) + (2 choose 2) + (3 choose 2) + (2 choose 2) + (3 choose 2) + (3 choose 2) + (2 choose 2) ]
Total number of triangles = (1/6) * [3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1]
Total number of triangles = (1/6) * 21
Total number of triangles = 3

Now, let's move on to step 2 to identify the unique triangles:

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
