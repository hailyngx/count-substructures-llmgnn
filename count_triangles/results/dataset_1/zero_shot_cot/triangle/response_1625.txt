Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Identify all triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other in a loop of three edges.

2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Based on the provided edges, here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<7, 5, 8>
<8, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
