Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
I will guide you through the process of counting the number of triangles in the graph:

Step 1: Identify Triangles
- Look for nodes that form triangles by connecting three edges.
- For example, if node A is connected to node B, B is connected to C, and C is connected back to A, then that forms a triangle.

Step 2: Counting Triangles
- After identifying the triangles, we will count them.
- Let's denote the nodes as numbers (0 to 9) for easier reference.

Identified Triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 9>

Total Number of Triangles: [5]
