Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Let's start by listing all the triangles and then counting them.

The possible triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <2, 1, 3>
3. <2, 3, 6>
4. <2, 3, 8>
5. <2, 6, 7>
6. <3, 6, 9>
7. <3, 7, 8>
8. <4, 7, 8>
9. <6, 7, 9>
10. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
