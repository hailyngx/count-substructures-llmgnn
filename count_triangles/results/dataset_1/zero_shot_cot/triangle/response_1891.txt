Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each combination of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle. Let's identify these triangles step-by-step:

1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <1, 6, 7>
3. <2, 4, 9>
4. <2, 5, 8>
5. <4, 6, 9>
6. <7, 8, 9>

After finding all the unique triangles, we count a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
