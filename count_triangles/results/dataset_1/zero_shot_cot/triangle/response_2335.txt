Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles that exist in the graph based on the provided edges. Let's go step-by-step and find the triangles:

1. Look for triangles formed by each node:
- Node 0: (0, 1) and (0, 5) are connected. However, there are no other edges originating from or coming into node 5 or node 1 to form a triangle with node 0.
- Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 6), and (1, 8) are connected. There's an edge (0, 5) that connects nodes 0 and 5. So, there's a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- Node 2: (2, 1) and (2, 8) are connected. There are no other edges involving nodes 1 and 8 to form a triangle with node 2.
- Node 3: (3, 5) are connected. No triangles can be formed with node 3 based on the given edges.
- Node 4: (4, 7) are connected. No triangles can be formed with node 4 based on the given edges.
- Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), and (5, 8) are connected. There's an edge (0, 1) that connects nodes 0 and 1. So, there's a triangle <0, 1, 5> (already considered).
- Node 6: (6, 1) and (6, 8) are connected. There are no other edges involving nodes 1 and 8 to form a triangle with node 6.
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 5), and (7, 8) are connected. No other edges involving nodes 4, 5, or 8 to form a triangle with node 7.
- Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 6), and (8, 7) are connected. There's an edge (1, 0) that connects nodes 0 and 1, creating a triangle <0, 1, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [2]
