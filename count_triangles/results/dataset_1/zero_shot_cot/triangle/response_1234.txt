Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 4.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 9.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle: <0, 6, 8>
2. Triangle: <4, 2, 9>
3. Triangle: <4, 6, 9>
