Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles that can be formed based on the given edges:
1. <0, 3, 1>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 5, 1>
4. <0, 5, 7>
5. <1, 3, 4>
6. <1, 3, 5>
7. <1, 4, 5>
8. <1, 5, 7>
9. <3, 6, 0>
10. <3, 6, 2>
11. <5, 9, 7>

Therefore, counting the total number of triangles gives us [11].
