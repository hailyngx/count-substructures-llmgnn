Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles is [5].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 9>.
