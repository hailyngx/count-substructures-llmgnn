Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify triangles
- For a triangle to exist, there must be a cycle of length 3.
- We need to look for nodes that are connected to form triangles.

Step 2: Identify possible triangles
Let's check each node and its connections to see if there are any triangles:
- Node 0: Connected to 6, 7
- Node 1: Connected to 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: Connected to 4, 6
- Node 3: Connected to 1, 8
- Node 4: Connected to 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: Connected to 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: Connected to 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: Connected to 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: Connected to 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: Connected to 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Step 3: Count the triangles
Based on the connections, we can identify the following triangles:
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [4].
