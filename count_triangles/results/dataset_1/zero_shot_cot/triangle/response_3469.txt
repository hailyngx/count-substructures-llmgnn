Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. From the given edges, we can see that the possible triangles involving node 0 are:
   - <0, 2, 6>
   - <0, 3, 6>
   - <0, 4, 5>
   - <0, 4, 6>
   - <0, 5, 6>

2. For node 1, the possible triangle involving it is:
   - <1, 3, 5>

3. For node 2, the possible triangle involving it is:
   - <2, 4, 6>

4. For node 3, the possible triangles involving it are:
   - <0, 3, 6>
   - <3, 4, 9>
   - <3, 5, 9>
   
5. For node 4, the possible triangles involving it are:
   - <0, 4, 6>
   - <4, 5, 6>
  
6. For node 5, the possible triangles involving it are:
   - <0, 4, 5>
   - <4, 5, 6>
   
7. For node 6, the possible triangles involving it are:
   - <0, 2, 6>
   - <0, 3, 6>
   - <0, 4, 6>
   - <4, 5, 6>

8. For node 9, the possible triangle involving it is:
   - <3, 4, 9>
   - <3, 5, 9>
   - <4, 5, 9>
   - <4, 6, 9>

By analyzing the possibilities, we see that there are 13 unique triangles.
So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
