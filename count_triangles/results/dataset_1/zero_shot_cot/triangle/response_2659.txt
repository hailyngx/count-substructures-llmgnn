Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the graph:
1. (1, 6, 7)
2. (2, 3, 9)
3. (2, 8, 5)
4. (2, 8, 7)
5. (3, 2, 9)
6. (6, 1, 7)
7. (7, 1, 6)
8. (7, 1, 8)

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total, and the answer is:
[8]
