Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Let's list all triangles by going through each node pair and checking if there is a path through a third node. 

- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
- Triangle 2: (0, 4, 5)
- Triangle 3: (0, 5, 6)
- Triangle 4: (2, 0, 4)
- Triangle 5: (2, 0, 5)
- Triangle 6: (2, 0, 6)
- Triangle 7: (2, 4, 5)
- Triangle 8: (2, 4, 6)
- Triangle 9: (3, 2, 8)
- Triangle 10: (4, 0, 5)
- Triangle 11: (4, 0, 6)
- Triangle 12: (4, 5, 8)
- Triangle 13: (5, 0, 6)
- Triangle 14: (5, 4, 8)
- Triangle 15: (5, 8, 9)
- Triangle 16: (6, 0, 4)
- Triangle 17: (6, 0, 5)
- Triangle 18: (6, 4, 8)
- Triangle 19: (8, 2, 5)
- Triangle 20: (8, 2, 6)
- Triangle 21: (8, 5, 9)

Step 2: Counting the total number of triangles = 21
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [21].
