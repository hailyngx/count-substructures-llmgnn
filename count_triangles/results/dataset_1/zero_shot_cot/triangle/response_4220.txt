Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Let's identify the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. From the provided edges:
   - Possible triangles involving node 0: <0, 4, 5> and <0, 4, 8>
   - Possible triangles involving node 1: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 2: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 4: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, and <4, 6, 7>
   - Possible triangles involving node 5: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 6: <4, 6, 7>
   - Possible triangles involving node 7: <4, 6, 7>
   - Possible triangles involving node 8: <0, 4, 8>
   - Possible triangles involving node 9: None

2. Unique triangles:
   - <0, 4, 5>
   - <0, 4, 8>
   - <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
