Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph and list the unique triangles, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify triangles by looking for nodes that have connections with each other in a triangle shape.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles and output the answer.

Let's start by listing the unique triangles in the graph:

<1, 3, 4>
<4, 7, 9>

Now, we can calculate the total number of triangles. 
Output: [2]
