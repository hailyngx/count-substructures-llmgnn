Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <4, 5, 6>

Now, counting the total number of triangles: [1]
