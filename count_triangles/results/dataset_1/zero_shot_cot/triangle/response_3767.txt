Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. We will go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 1, 2)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 1, 3)
3. Triangle 3: (0, 1, 5)
4. Triangle 4: (0, 2, 3)
5. Triangle 5: (0, 2, 8)
6. Triangle 6: (0, 3, 5)
7. Triangle 7: (0, 5, 8)
8. Triangle 8: (1, 2, 3)
9. Triangle 9: (1, 5, 7)
10. Triangle 10: (2, 3, 5)
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **10 triangles** [10].
