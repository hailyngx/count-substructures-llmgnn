Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <2, 4, 9>
4. <2, 5, 8>
5. <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
