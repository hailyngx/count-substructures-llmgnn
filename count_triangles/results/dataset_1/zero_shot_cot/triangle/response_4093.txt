Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. Let's determine the total number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Identify all triangles present in the graph:
   - We will list all possible triangles by examining each set of three nodes to see if they form a triangle:
     - Triangle 1: (0, 5, 6)
     - Triangle 2: (1, 6, 7)
     - Triangle 3: (1, 4, 8)
     - Triangle 4: (2, 4, 5)
     - Triangle 5: (4, 5, 6)
     - Triangle 6: (4, 7, 9)
     - Triangle 7: (5, 6, 7)

2. Count the number of unique triangles:
   - We found a total of 7 unique triangles in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are as follows:
<0, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 7>.
