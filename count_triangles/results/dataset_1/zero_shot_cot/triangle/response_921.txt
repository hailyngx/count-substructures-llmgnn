Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
Unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 9, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.
