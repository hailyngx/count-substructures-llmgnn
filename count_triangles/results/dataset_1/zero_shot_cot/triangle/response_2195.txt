Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. For each node A, B, and C, check if there is an edge between A and B, B and C, and C and A:
   - Triangle 1: Nodes (0, 5, 9) form a triangle.
   - Triangle 2: Nodes (1, 6, 4) form a triangle. 
   - Triangle 3: Nodes (2, 8, 3) form a triangle.
   - Triangle 4: Nodes (3, 7, 5) form a triangle.
   - Triangle 5: Nodes (6, 8, 3) form a triangle.
   - Triangle 6: Nodes (5, 6, 4) form a triangle.

Counting the unique triangles found:
