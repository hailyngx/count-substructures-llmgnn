Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 5 and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 4.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.

Based on the connections, we can identify the following unique triangles:
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 8, 9>

Count of triangles: [2]
