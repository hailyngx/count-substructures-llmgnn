Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 1, 8>
4. <1, 5, 7>
5. <1, 3, 7>
6. <2, 1, 5>
7. <2, 1, 3>
8. <3, 4, 7>
9. <6, 2, 5>
10. <7, 9, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
