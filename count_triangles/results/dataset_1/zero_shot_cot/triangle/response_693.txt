Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, let's identify all the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 7, 8)
- Triangle 2: (1, 2, 4)
- Triangle 3: (2, 6, 7)
- Triangle 4: (2, 7, 8)
- Triangle 5: (3, 5, 7)
- Triangle 6: (5, 7, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = 6

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
