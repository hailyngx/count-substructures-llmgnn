Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Look at each node:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to Node 1.
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 2, 4, and 8.

2. Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle 2: <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle 3: <1, 7, 9>
- Triangle 4: <2, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the total number of triangles is [4].
