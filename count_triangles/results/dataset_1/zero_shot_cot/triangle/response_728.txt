Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all the possible triangles by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them forming triangles.

Let's list out all the triangles found in the graph:

1. <1, 3, 9>
2. <1, 4, 8>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <1, 6, 9>
5. <2, 6, 7>
6. <3, 4, 9>
7. <3, 5, 9>
8. <4, 8, 9>
9. <6, 7, 8>
10. <7, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [10].
