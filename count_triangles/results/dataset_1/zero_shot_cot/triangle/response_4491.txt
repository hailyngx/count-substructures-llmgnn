Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow these steps:
1. Identify all the triangles in the graph.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <5, 4, 8>
- <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
