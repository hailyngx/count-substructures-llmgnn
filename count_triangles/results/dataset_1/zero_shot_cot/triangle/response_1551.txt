Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's find the number of triangles present in the graph.

A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected by edges in such a way that they form a closed loop.

Now, let's find the total number of triangles in this graph: [40]

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
