Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the given graph:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 4>

So, there are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
