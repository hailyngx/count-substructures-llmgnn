Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <0, 3, 2>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <1, 4, 6>
5. <2, 3, 5>
6. <5, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
