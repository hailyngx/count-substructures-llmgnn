Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.
  - Triangle <0, 2, 4>
  - Triangle <0, 4, 6>
  - Triangle <1, 4, 7>
  - Triangle <2, 4, 5>
  - Triangle <2, 4, 9>
  - Triangle <2, 5, 9>
  - Triangle <3, 4, 5>
  - Triangle <4, 5, 7>
  - Triangle <4, 5, 8>
  - Triangle <5, 8, 9>
  - Triangle <6, 4, 9>
  - Triangle <7, 4, 9>
  - Triangle <7, 5, 9>
  - Triangle <8, 4, 5>
  - Triangle <8, 5, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles.
  Total number of triangles: [15]
