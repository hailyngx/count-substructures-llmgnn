Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by the connected nodes. Here are the steps to find the triangles:

1. Look for nodes that have a common edge to form triangles.
2. Find the triangles with unique combinations of nodes.

Let's start counting the triangles:
- We can clearly see the following triangles:
    - <0, 1, 2>
    - <0, 1, 4>
    - <1, 6, 8>
    - <2, 5, 7>
    - <5, 6, 8>
    - <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
