Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a triangle.

Looking at the provided edges, we can list the triangles one by one:

1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <2, 3, 8>
4. <2, 6, 9>
5. <4, 6, 7>
6. <7, 8, 4>
7. <7, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
