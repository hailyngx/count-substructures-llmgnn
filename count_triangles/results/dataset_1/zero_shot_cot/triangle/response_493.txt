Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every possible set of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
