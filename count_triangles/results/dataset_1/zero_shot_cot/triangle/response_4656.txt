Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 1
- Node 2: degree = 3
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 3
- Node 5: degree = 2
- Node 6: degree = 1
- Node 7: degree = 2
- Node 8: degree = 5
- Node 9: degree = 1

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles.
- For each edge in the graph, check if there is a triangle involving that edge.
- Count the number of unique triangles formed.

The total number of triangles is [3].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 5>.
