Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles one by one:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
