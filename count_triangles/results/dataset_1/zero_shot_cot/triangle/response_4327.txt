Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze each possible triangle formed by three nodes. A triangle is formed if three nodes are connected to each other by edges. Let's list the unique triangles that can be formed based on the given edges:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 2, 5>
3. <1, 4, 9>
4. <2, 7, 9>
5. <3, 4, 5>
6. <4, 7, 9>
7. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [**7**] triangles in the given graph.
