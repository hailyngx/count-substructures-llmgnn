Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to both of the other two nodes.

Following the given edges, we can identify the triangles as follows:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 5>
4. Triangle <1, 8, 9>
5. Triangle <8, 3, 9>

Thus, there are 5 triangles in total in this graph. So, the answer is [5].
