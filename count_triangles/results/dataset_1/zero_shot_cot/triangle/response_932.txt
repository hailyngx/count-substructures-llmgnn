Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Given the list of edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <2, 6, 7>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <7, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
