Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph
- A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.
- For each node, check if there are two edges connecting it to two other nodes that are also connected to each other.

Triangular triples: (1, 2, 4), (2, 4, 1), (4, 1, 2)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles
- The total number of triangles in the given graph is 1.
