Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's go through the nodes and their connections to find the triangles.

From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:

- Triangle 1: <0, 6, 8>
- Triangle 2: <1, 3, 9>
- Triangle 3: <1, 5, 9>
- Triangle 4: <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle 6: <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
