Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other, creating a closed loop. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9. This forms a triangle <0, 1, 7>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5. This forms a triangle <1, 2, 5>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6. This forms a triangle <1, 2, 5>.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7. This forms a triangle <1, 4, 6>.
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8. This forms a triangle <0, 7, 3>.
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6. This forms a triangle <0, 9, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
