Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first denote the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 1), (7, 3), (9, 1)

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

The possible triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 5, 2>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <0, 6, 2>
4. <1, 7, 9>
5. <2, 5, 6>
6. <3, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in this graph. So, the output is [6].
