Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by 3 nodes connected by edges.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<5, 7, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
