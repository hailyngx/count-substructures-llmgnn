Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <1, 3, 2>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <1, 5, 8>
4. <2, 3, 5>
5. <2, 4, 5>
6. <2, 5, 8>
7. <3, 4, 5>
8. <3, 4, 8>
9. <3, 5, 8>
10. <4, 5, 8>
11. <7, 3, 4>
12. <7, 3, 8>
13. <7, 4, 8>
14. <7, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
