Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: (1, 6, 8)
2. Nodes connected to node 1: (2, 3, 4)
3. Nodes connected to node 2: (3, 4)
4. Nodes connected to node 3: (4)
5. Nodes connected to node 4: (5, 9)
6. Nodes connected to node 5: (9)
7. Nodes connected to node 6: (0)
8. Nodes connected to node 8: (0)
9. Nodes connected to node 9: (5)

Based on the connections above, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
