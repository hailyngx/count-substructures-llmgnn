Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 1.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
0 - A
1 - B
2 - C
3 - D
4 - E
5 - F
6 - G
7 - H
8 - I
9 - J

Now, let's find the triangles (cycles of length 3) in this graph by analyzing the connections:
1. Triangle <1, 2, 6> (B-C-G)
2. Triangle <2, 5, 9> (C-F-J)
3. Triangle <2, 6, 9> (C-G-J)
4. Triangle <4, 6, 8> (E-G-I)
5. Triangle <5, 6, 9> (F-G-J)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
