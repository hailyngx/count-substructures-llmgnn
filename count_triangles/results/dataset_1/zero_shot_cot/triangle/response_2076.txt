Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will examine each possible triangle formed by three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

By analyzing the provided graph, we can identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
