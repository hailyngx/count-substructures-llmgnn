Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique combinations of three nodes that form triangles.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
