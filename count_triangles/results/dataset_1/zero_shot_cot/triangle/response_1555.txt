Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the triangles in the graph:
1. Nodes participating in a triangle:
   - Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 2, 5, 6, and 7.
   - Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 8.
   - Node 3 doesn't form any triangles.
   - Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, and 6.
   - Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 6.
   - Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
   - Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 3.
   - Node 8 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 6.
   - Node 9 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 6.

2. Counting the triangles:
   - <1, 2, 8>
   - <1, 5, 6>
   - <1, 6, 7>
   - <4, 6, 9>
   - Total number of triangles: [4]  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
