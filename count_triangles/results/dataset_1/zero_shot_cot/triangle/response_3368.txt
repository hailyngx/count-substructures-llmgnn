Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 9>.
