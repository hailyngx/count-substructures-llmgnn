Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other in the graph. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 5, creating a potential triangle.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 7, creating a potential triangle.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8, creating potential triangles.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and potentially 5 (already considered), creating potential triangles.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7 (already considered), creating potential triangles.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9, creating potential triangles.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5 (already considered), 6 (already considered), creating potential triangles.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 (already considered), 6 (already considered), 9, creating potential triangles.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 (already considered), 8, creating a potential triangle.

Let's list the unique triangles found:
<3, 4, 5>
<6, 7, 9>

Now, we can output the total number of triangles: [2].
