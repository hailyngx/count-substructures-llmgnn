Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7.

Now, let's find all the triangles (closed loops of size 3) in this graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <0, 7, 8>
5. <3, 4, 6>
6. <3, 6, 7>
7. <4, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [7].
