Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first list out all the triangles that exist in the graph.

Given Edges:
- (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)
- (1, 4)
- (2, 8)
- (3, 6)
- (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 7)
- (5, 0), (5, 7), (5, 8)
- (6, 3)
- (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 5)
- (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5)
- (9, 0)

Now, let's look for triangles formed by these edges:

Triangles:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
