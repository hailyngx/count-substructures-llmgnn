Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all possible combinations of 3 nodes that form a triangle.

Here are the triangles in the given graph:
1. <2, 0, 4>
2. <2, 3, 4>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <0, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
