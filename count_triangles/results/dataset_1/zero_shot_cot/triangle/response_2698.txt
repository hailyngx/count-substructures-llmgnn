Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will determine the number of triangles in the graph.

To count the number of triangles, we will look for groups of 3 nodes that are all interconnected. Let's analyze the connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5.
- Node 1 is connected to node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.

Let's find the triangles:
1. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
2. Triangle <3, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <5, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
