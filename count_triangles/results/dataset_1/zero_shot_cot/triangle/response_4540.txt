Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each possible triangle formed by three nodes and see if there exists an edge between each pair of nodes in the triangle. In this case, we have the following triangles:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <0, 4, 6>
5. <0, 4, 9>
6. <0, 6, 9>
7. <1, 3, 8>
8. <2, 4, 8>
9. <3, 5, 8>
10. <3, 8, 9>
11. <4, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
