Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all possible sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

First, let's list down all the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 2, 3>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <2, 3, 8>
6. <3, 5, 9>
7. <4, 5, 9>
8. <8, 5, 6>

There are a total of 8 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [8].
