Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 2.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8.

Now, let's list down the triangles in the graph:

1. <2, 0, 6>
2. <2, 0, 7>
3. <2, 0, 9>
4. <2, 6, 8>
5. <2, 7, 6>
6. <2, 7, 8>
7. <2, 6, 8>
8. <8, 1, 4>
9. <8, 1, 9>
10. <8, 4, 6>
11. <8, 4, 9>
12. <8, 6, 9>
13. <9, 2, 3>
14. <9, 2, 4>
15. <9, 2, 5>
16. <9, 2, 8>
17. <9, 3, 4>
18. <9, 3, 5>
19. <9, 3, 8>
20. <9, 4, 5>
21. <9, 4, 8>
22. <9, 5, 8>
