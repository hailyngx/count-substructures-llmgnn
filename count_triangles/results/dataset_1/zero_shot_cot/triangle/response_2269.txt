Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. List out all triangles:

<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 1>
<5, 6, 1>
<3, 6, 5>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles: [6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
