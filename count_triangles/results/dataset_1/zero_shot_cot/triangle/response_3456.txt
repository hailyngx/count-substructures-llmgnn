Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by listing the possible triangles:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <1, 3, 8>
3. <1, 8, 9>
4. <2, 6, 9>
5. <3, 5, 8>
6. <3, 6, 9>
7. <4, 6, 9>
8. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
