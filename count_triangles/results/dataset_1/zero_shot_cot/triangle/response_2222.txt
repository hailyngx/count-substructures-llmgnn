Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the combinations of three nodes that form a triangle. Three nodes form a triangle if each node is connected to the other two nodes.

By examining the given edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
