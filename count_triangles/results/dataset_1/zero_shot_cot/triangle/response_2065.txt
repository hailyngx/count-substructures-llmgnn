Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Nodes involved in triangle <0, 2, 6>.
2. Nodes involved in triangle <0, 2, 7>.
3. Nodes involved in triangle <0, 5, 6>.
4. Nodes involved in triangle <0, 5, 9>.
5. Nodes involved in triangle <2, 6, 7>.
6. Nodes involved in triangle <2, 3, 9>.
7. Nodes involved in triangle <3, 4, 7>.
8. Nodes involved in triangle <5, 6, 9>.

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
