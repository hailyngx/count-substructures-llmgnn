Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph using an adjacency list:

0: [1]
1: [0, 2, 4, 9]
2: [1, 3, 4, 6]
3: [2, 5, 8]
4: [1, 2, 6]
5: [3]
6: [2, 4, 7, 8]
7: [6]
8: [3, 6, 9]
9: [1, 8]

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph.

Number of triangles: [1]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
