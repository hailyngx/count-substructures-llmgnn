Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 1, 0>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 7, 2>
<3, 4, 5>
<9, 6, 0>
<9, 6, 0>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
