Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every possible triangle formed by three connected nodes.

Let's list out the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 1>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 7, 1>
<5, 7, 1>
<6, 8, 1>
<7, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
