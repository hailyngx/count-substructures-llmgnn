Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Looking at the given edges, we can see that a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's identify them:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7.
     - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 8.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8.
     - Triangle 2: <0, 6, 4>
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 8.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, 8.
     - Triangle 3: <6, 0, 4>
     - Triangle 4: <6, 3, 8>
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
     - Triangle 5: <8, 3, 4>
     - Triangle 6: <8, 4, 6>
     - Triangle 7: <8, 5, 1>
     - Triangle 8: <8, 6, 0>
     - Triangle 9: <8, 6, 4>

2. Calculating the total number of triangles: 9 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
