Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. Let's find these triangles step by step:

1. Triangle 1: Nodes 0-7-8 form a triangle.
2. Triangle 2: Nodes 3-4-9 form a triangle.
3. Triangle 3: Nodes 2-7-8 form a triangle.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph:
<0, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <2, 7, 8>.
