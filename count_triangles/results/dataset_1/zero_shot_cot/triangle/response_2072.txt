Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph by looking for nodes that form a cycle of length 3. 

The possible triangles in this graph are:
1. <2, 3, 4>
2. <2, 4, 8>
3. <2, 8, 6>
4. <2, 8, 9>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <4, 5, 8>
7. <4, 8, 9>
8. <5, 8, 9>
9. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in total in this graph. So, the total number of triangles is [9].
