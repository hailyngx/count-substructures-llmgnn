Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's go step-by-step in finding the triangles:

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <1, 2, 8>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <2, 4, 8>
  
There are [4] triangles in total.
