Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 3 [<0, 1, 6>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 7, 6>].
