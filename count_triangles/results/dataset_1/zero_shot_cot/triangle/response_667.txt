Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's count the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
