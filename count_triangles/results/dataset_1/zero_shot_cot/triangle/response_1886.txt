Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are as follows:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 2, 8>
<5, 3, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
