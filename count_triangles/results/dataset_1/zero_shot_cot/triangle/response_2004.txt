Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes that are connected to each other. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 9, 2>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 3>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 5>
<6, 4, 5>
<6, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
