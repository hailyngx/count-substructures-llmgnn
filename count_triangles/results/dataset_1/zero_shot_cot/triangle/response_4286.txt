Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each unique triangle formed by three connected nodes.
  
Upon examining the graph, we can identify the following triangles:
- <1, 4, 2>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 9, 5>
- <4, 6, 0>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <9, 5, 1>
- <9, 5, 3>
- <9, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
