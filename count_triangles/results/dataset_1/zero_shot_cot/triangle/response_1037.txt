Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by 3 connected nodes. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <4, 6, 7>
5. <5, 6, 7>
6. <5, 6, 9>
7. <5, 7, 9>
8. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
