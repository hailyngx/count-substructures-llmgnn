Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
