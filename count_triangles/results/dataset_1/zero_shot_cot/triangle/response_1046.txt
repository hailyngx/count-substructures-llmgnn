Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's list them step-by-step.

1. (0, 2, 4)
2. (0, 3, 4)
3. (2, 3, 4)
4. (3, 4, 7)
5. (4, 7, 9)

There are 5 unique triangles in the given graph. Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
