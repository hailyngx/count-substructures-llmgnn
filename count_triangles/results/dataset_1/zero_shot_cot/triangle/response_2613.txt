Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can determine the number of triangles present. To find triangles, we look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's list the triangles first:
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
