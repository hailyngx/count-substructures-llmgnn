Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The triangles in a graph can be formed by 3 nodes that are all connected to each other. To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for each possible combination of 3 nodes and check if they form a triangle.

The possible triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 7, 8>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <3, 5, 7>
5. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
