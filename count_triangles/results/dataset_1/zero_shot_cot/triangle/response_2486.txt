Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 6, but these nodes are not directly connected to each other.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7, but these nodes are not directly connected to each other.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6, but these nodes are not directly connected to each other.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5, and node 4 connects them.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and itself, forming multiple triangles.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7, forming a triangle.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9, forming multiple triangles.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9, forming a triangle.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 9, but there are no other nodes forming a triangle with them.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8, forming a triangle.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are:
<3, 4, 5>
<6, 4, 0>
<6, 4, 2>
<6, 4, 9>
<7, 5, 9>
<7, 1, 4>
