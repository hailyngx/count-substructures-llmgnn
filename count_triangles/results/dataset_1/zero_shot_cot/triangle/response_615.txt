Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in an adjacency list format for better understanding:
0: [1, 2, 5, 8]
1: [0, 4, 5]
2: [0]
3: [5, 8]
4: [1, 6]
5: [0, 1, 3, 9]
6: [4]
8: [0, 3]
9: [5]

Now, we will count the number of triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
4. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
5. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
6. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
7. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
8. Triangle <0, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
