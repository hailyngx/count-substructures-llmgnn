Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given graph has the following edges:
- 0 is connected to 4, 6
- 1 is connected to 3, 5, 9
- 2 is connected to 5
- 3 is connected to 1
- 4 is connected to 0, 6, 9
- 5 is connected to 1, 2, 6, 9
- 6 is connected to 0, 4, 5, 9
- 9 is connected to 1, 4, 5, 6

Let's now count the number of triangles in the graph.
