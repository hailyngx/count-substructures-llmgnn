Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <0, 3, 7>
4. <0, 4, 5>
5. <2, 6, 7>
6. <2, 6, 8>
7. <2, 7, 8>
8. <5, 6, 7>
9. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. So, the output is [9].
