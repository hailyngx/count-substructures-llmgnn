Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 6}

Step 2: Identify the triangles:
- Triangle <3, 4, 6>
- Triangle <4, 6, 8>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles: [2]
