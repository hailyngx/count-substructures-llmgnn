Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
3. Node 4 is connected to node 0.
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
7. Node 8 is connected to node 6.
8. Node 9 is connected to node 3.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
