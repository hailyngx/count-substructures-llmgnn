Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
