Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we need to count the number of triangles in the graph.

To count the triangles, we need to identify the unique sets of three nodes that form triangles. In a triangle, each node is connected to the other two nodes in the set.

Let's identify the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 7, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 2>
4. Triangle <0, 9, 6>
5. Triangle <1, 0, 7>
6. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
7. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
8. Triangle <4, 3, 7>
9. Triangle <9, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
