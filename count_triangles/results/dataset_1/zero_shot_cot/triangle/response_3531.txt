Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles present in the graph:
1. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 6, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
