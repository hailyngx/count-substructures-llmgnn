Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in a graph, we look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <1, 2, 8>
4. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
