Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Drawing the graph based on the given edges.

The graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 8), (4, 6), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 8)

Step 2: Counting the triangles.

Now, let's find the total number of triangles in this graph.

[Total number of triangles: <0, 3, 8>, <7, 8, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
