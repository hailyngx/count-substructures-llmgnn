Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 7.
3. Node 3 is connected to node 5.
4. Node 4 is connected to node 6.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7.
9. Node 9 is connected to node 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (5, 6, 8)
- Triangle 2: (7, 6, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <5, 6, 8> and <7, 6, 8>.
