Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's start by listing all the triangles we can find:

1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <2, 6, 7>
3. <2, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
