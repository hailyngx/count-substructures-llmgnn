Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 6, 7, and 9.
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 8.
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 5.
4. Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 2.
5. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 8.
6. Node 5 does not form any triangles with the given edges.
7. Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 forms triangles with nodes 0, 8, and 9.
9. Node 8 forms triangles with nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
10. Node 9 forms triangles with nodes 0, 6, and 7.

Therefore, the unique triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 2, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.

Hence, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
