Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 8.
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 8.
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 8.
4. Node 3: Connected to node 6, 8.
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 6.
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 7.
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, 9.
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 5, 6.
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6.
10. Node 9: Connected to node 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

1. <0, 5, 8>
2. <0, 8, 1>
3. <0, 8, 2>
4. <2, 1, 8>
5. <2, 4, 6>
6. <3, 6, 8>
7. <6, 4, 2>
8. <6, 4, 7>
9. <6, 7, 5>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
