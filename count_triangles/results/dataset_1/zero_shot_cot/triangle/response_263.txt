Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle in a graph is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. To find all triangles, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected.

Looking at the edges given, we can identify the following triangles:
1. (0, 3, 4)
2. (0, 3, 8)
3. (0, 4, 5)
4. (0, 5, 8)
5. (1, 4, 5)
6. (2, 7, 9)

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, and <2, 7, 9>.
