Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the given graph, let's count the number of triangles in it step-by-step:
1. Looking at node 0: It is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8, and 9.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 6> is formed.
   - No more triangles at node 0.

2. Looking at node 1: It is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 2> is formed.
   - No more triangles at node 1.

3. Looking at node 2: It is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9.
   - No triangles are formed at node 2.

4. Looking at node 3: It is connected to nodes 1, 2.
   - No triangles are formed at node 3.

5. Looking at node 4: It is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9.
   - No triangles are formed at node 4.

6. Looking at node 5: It is connected to nodes 1, 2.
   - No triangles are formed at node 5.

7. Looking at node 6: It is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8.
   - No triangles are formed at node 6.

8. Looking at node 7: It is connected to nodes 4, 6.
   - No triangles are formed at node 7.

9. Looking at node 8: It is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 9.
   - Triangle <0, 8, 9> is formed.
   - No more triangles at node 8.

10. Looking at node 9: It is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 8.
    - Triangle <0, 9, 8> is formed.
    - No more triangles at node 9.

Counting the total number of triangles: [3]
