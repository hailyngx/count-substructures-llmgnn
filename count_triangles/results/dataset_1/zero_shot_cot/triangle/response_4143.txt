Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Given graph has the following edges:
- 0: 3, 6, 9
- 1: 4, 7
- 2: 8
- 3: 0, 4, 5
- 4: 1, 3, 5, 8
- 5: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- 6: 0, 5
- 7: 1, 5, 8
- 8: 2, 4, 5, 7
- 9: 0

Let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
4. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
6. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
7. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
