Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique groups of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

From the given edges, we can see the following triangles:
1. Nodes 2, 3, and 7 form a triangle.
2. Nodes 2, 3, and 8 form a triangle.
3. Nodes 2, 7, and 8 form a triangle.
4. Nodes 3, 4, and 7 form a triangle.
5. Nodes 3, 4, and 8 form a triangle.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
