Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each set of three nodes and check if they form a triangle by having edges between all three pairs of nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: 1, 5, 7
2. Nodes connected to node 1: 0, 5
3. Nodes connected to node 2: 3, 5, 7, 9
4. Nodes connected to node 3: 2, 4
5. Nodes connected to node 4: 3, 9
6. Nodes connected to node 5: 0, 1, 2, 8
7. Nodes connected to node 6: 7, 9
8. Nodes connected to node 7: 0, 2, 6
9. Nodes connected to node 8: 5, 9
10. Nodes connected to node 9: 2, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's list the unique triangles found:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 7, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
