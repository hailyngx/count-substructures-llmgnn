Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.
2. Count the total number of triangles.
3. List the unique triangles.

Identifying the triangles in the graph:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
