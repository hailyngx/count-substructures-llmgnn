Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique triangles formed by the connected nodes. Let's go through the steps:

1. Identify the triangles:
   - Based on the given edges, the possible triangles are formed by nodes 0, 4, 6; 3, 4, 8; and 4, 5, 8.

2. Count the total number of triangles:
   - There are 3 triangles in this graph.

Output: There are a total of [3] triangles in this graph. 

Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
