Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to each other in a triangular manner.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's start by identifying the unique triangles in the graph:

Triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 5>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [4] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 4.
