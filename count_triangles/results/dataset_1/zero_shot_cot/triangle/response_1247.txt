Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

1. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
