Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
4. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
5. Triangle <1, 6, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
7. Triangle <3, 7, 9>
8. Triangle <6, 7, 9>
9. Triangle <1, 8, 6>

Total number of triangles: [9]
