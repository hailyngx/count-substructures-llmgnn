Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Looking at each node individually:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8.

2. Now, let's look for triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
- <0, 2, 9>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <5, 8, 9>

3. Calculating the total number of triangles: [4]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
