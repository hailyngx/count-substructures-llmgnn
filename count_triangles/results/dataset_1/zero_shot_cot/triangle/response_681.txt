Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
