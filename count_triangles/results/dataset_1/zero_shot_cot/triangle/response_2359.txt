Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in a graph, we need to examine the connections among nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in such a way that they form a closed loop. 

Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <6, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Since these triangles are symmetric, we need to count each unique triangle once. Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
