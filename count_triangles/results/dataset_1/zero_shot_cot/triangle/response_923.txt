Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles by finding nodes that are connected in a triangle-like manner.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph:
1. By observing the edges, we can see the following triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 3, 4)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 3: (2, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 4: (2, 5, 0)
   - Triangle 5: (5, 6, 9)

2. Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles: [5].

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 0>, <5, 6, 9>.
