Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we look for sets of three nodes connected by edges. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <1, 4, 2>
2. <1, 4, 5>
3. <1, 5, 2>
4. <1, 5, 8>
5. <1, 9, 6>
6. <2, 3, 5>
7. <3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
