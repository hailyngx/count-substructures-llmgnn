Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 4, 6>, <4, 8, 9>. So, the total number of triangles is [4].
