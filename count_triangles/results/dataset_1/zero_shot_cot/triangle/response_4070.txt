Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected by edges. Let's do this step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles by looking at each possible set of three connected nodes:

1. Triangles involving node 0: None
2. Triangles involving node 1: None
3. Triangles involving node 2: None
4. Triangles involving node 3: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <3, 7, 9>
5. Triangles involving node 4: None
6. Triangles involving node 5: None
7. Triangles involving node 6: None
8. Triangles involving node 7: None
9. Triangles involving node 8: None
10. Triangles involving node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, and <3, 7, 9>.
