Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the given graph, let's count the number of triangles:

- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 1)
- Triangle 2: (2, 4, 7)
- Triangle 3: (2, 7, 4)
- Triangle 4: (2, 7, 8)

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in this graph: [4].
