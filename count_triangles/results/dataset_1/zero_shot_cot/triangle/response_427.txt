Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles present. A triangle is formed when three nodes are fully connected to each other. Let's analyze the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle 3: <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
