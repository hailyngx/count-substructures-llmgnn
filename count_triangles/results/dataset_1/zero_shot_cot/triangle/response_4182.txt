Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to see how many sets of three nodes are connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Start by looking for triangles:
   - Node 0: None
   - Node 1: None
   - Node 2: None
   - Node 3: (3, 4, 6)
   - Node 4: None
   - Node 5: None
   - Node 6: None
   - Node 7: None
   - Node 8: None
   - Node 9: None

2. Count the triangles:
   - <3, 4, 6>

Finally, output the total number of triangles in the graph inside brackets:
