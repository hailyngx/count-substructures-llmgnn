Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to node 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 7.

To find triangles, we look for nodes that have two edges connecting them. Any set of three nodes forming a triangle will have three edges between them. Let's list the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <2, 5, 6>
3. <2, 5, 7>
4. <2, 6, 5>
5. <2, 7, 5>
6. <4, 7, 5>
7. <5, 7, 2>
8. <7, 4, 5>
9. <7, 5, 2>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
