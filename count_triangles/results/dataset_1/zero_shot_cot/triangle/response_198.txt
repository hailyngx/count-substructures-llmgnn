Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to examine all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other through edges.

Starting with the given graph and the provided information, we can identify the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <0, 2, 7>
4. <0, 4, 6>
5. <0, 7, 5>
6. <0, 7, 8>
7. <1, 4, 6>
8. <1, 7, 5>
9. <1, 7, 8>
10. <2, 7, 5>
11. <3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
