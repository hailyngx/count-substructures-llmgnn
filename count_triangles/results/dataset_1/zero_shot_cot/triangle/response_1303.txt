Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 9. A triangle is formed with nodes (0, 2, 6).
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5. No triangle is formed with these connections.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8. No triangle is formed with these connections.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6. No triangle is formed with these connections.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 5. No triangle is formed with these connections.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 4. No triangle is formed with these connections.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 3. No triangle is formed with these connections.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 9. No triangle is formed with these connections.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 2. No triangle is formed with this connection.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and creates a triangle with nodes (0, 7, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 6> and <0, 7, 9>.
