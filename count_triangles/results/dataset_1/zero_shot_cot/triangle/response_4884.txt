Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we need to find the number of triangles present in the graph. 

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8.
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.

Therefore, the triangles in the graph are:
1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <2, 6, 9>
3. <2, 6, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in brackets is [3].
