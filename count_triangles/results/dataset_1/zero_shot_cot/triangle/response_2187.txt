Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes connected by edges.

After analyzing the given graph, the unique triangles found are:
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 9, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 9, 3>
<8, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
