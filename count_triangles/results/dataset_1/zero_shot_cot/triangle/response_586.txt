Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are interconnected. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes connected pairwise by edges.

Let's list down the unique triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <1, 5, 2>
4. <2, 5, 8>
5. <2, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
