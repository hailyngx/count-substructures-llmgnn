Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step to determine the number of triangles:

1. For each node, identify its neighbors based on the given edges:
   - Node 0: neighbors are 1, 3, 6
   - Node 1: neighbors are 0, 7, 8
   - Node 2: neighbor is 5
   - Node 3: neighbors are 0, 6, 8
   - Node 4: neighbors are 6, 7
   - Node 5: neighbor is 2
   - Node 6: neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
   - Node 7: neighbors are 1, 4, 6, 9
   - Node 8: neighbors are 1, 3
   - Node 9: neighbors are 6, 7

2. Look for triangles based on the neighbors of each node:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 6, 3>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 6, 4>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 6, 5>
   - Triangle 5: <0, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 6: <0, 6, 9>
   - Triangle 7: <1, 7, 4>
   - Triangle 8: <1, 7, 6>
   - Triangle 9: <1, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 10: <3, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 11: <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
