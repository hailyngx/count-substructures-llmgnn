Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique combinations of 3 nodes that form a triangle.

Here are the triangles identified:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 7, 8>
4. <2, 4, 8>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <3, 4, 7>
7. <4, 6, 8>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
