Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will list all triangles in the graph. A triangle in a graph is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. We consider all possible triangles:
- Triangle 1: (1,3,6)
- Triangle 2: (1,4,7)
- Triangle 3: (1,8,9)

The total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
