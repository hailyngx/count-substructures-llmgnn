Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify combinations of three nodes that are connected to each other forming triangles. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <1, 3, 5>
2. <1, 3, 7>
3. <1, 5, 8>
4. <3, 4, 7>
5. <3, 5, 8>
6. <7, 4, 0>

Total number of triangles: [6]
