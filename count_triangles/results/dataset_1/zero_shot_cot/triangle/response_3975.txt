Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, the total number of triangles can be calculated by identifying unique triangles formed by nodes that are interconnected with edges. Let's go step by step:
1. A triangle is formed by three nodes interconnected in a closed loop.
2. We will identify all possible triangles by examining each set of three interconnected nodes.

The triangles in this graph are:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle 3: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 4: <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle 5: <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle 6: <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
