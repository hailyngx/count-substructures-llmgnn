Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. In other words, we need to find all the triangles in the graph.

Let's list down the triangles found in the graph:

Triangles:
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
