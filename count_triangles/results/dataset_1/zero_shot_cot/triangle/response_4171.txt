Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes. 

From the provided edges, we can observe the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <2, 6, 8>
4. <4, 6, 7>
  
Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
