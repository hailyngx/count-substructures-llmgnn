Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's find the triangles and count them:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
4. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
6. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
7. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
8. Triangle <3, 6, 4>
9. Triangle <3, 6, 5>
10. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
11. Triangle <3, 9, 1>
12. Triangle <3, 9, 2>
13. Triangle <3, 9, 9>

There are 13 triangles in total, which can be seen represented as <node1, node2, node3>. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
