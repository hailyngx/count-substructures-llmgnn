Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's solve this step-by-step to find the number of triangles in the graph:

1. First, let's list all the unique triangles in the graph:
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <0, 2, 6>
   - <1, 2, 5>
   - <1, 5, 7>
   - <2, 5, 7>
   - <2, 7, 9>
   - <3, 4, 9>
  
2. Count the total number of unique triangles: [7]
