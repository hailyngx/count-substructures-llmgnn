Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, let's count the number of triangles:

1. We have 10 nodes labeled from 0 to 9.
2. Let's identify triangles by looking for sets of nodes where each node is connected to every other node in the set.
3. We will list the triangles we find.

List of triangles:
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
