Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
[<0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 8, 3>, <8, 6, 7>]
