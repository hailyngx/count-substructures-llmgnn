Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's locate the triangles in the given graph. A triangle in a graph is formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the edges provided:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 5)
- Triangle 2: (0, 1, 9)
- Triangle 3: (0, 5, 9)
- Triangle 4: (1, 5, 8)
- Triangle 5: (1, 6, 9)
- Triangle 6: (2, 5, 7)
- Triangle 7: (4, 9, 0)
- Triangle 8: (5, 6, 7)
- Triangle 9: (5, 7, 8)
- Triangle 10: (6, 7, 5)

So there are a total of 10 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the output is:
[10]
