Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, we need to find the total number of triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's find them step by step:

Step 1: Identify the triangles using each node.  
- Node 0: No triangles.
- Node 1: No triangles.
- Node 2: Triangles: <2, 7, 8>, <2, 8, 9>.
- Node 3: No triangles.
- Node 5: No triangles.
- Node 6: No triangles.
- Node 7: No triangles.
- Node 8: No triangles.
- Node 9: No triangles.

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles obtained from Step 1. 
- Total number of triangles = 2

Therefore, the answer is:
