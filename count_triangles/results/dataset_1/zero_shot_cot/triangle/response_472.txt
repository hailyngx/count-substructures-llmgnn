Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's count the number of triangles incrementally:

1. Start by examining each node:
   - Node 0: No triangles can be formed since it has edges with nodes 4 only.
   - Node 1: No triangles can be formed since it has an edge with node 3 only.
   - Node 2: Possible triangles include <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, and <2, 6, 9>.
   - Node 3: Possible triangles include <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, and <2, 3, 9>.
   - Node 4: No triangles can be formed since it has edges with nodes 0 and 8 only.
   - Node 5: No triangles can be formed since it has edges with nodes 3 and 9 only.
   - Node 6: No triangles can be formed since it has an edge with node 2 only.
   - Node 7: Possible triangles include <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, and <2, 7, 9>.
   - Node 8: No triangles can be formed since it has edges with nodes 2 and 4 only.
   - Node 9: Possible triangles include <2, 3, 9> and <2, 6, 9>.

2. Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: 6

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 7, 9>, and <2, 6, 9>.
