Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of closed loops of length 3. In a triangle, each node is connected to the other two nodes forming a closed loop.

By examining the given graph, we can identify the triangles. Let's list them:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the number of triangles is [8].
