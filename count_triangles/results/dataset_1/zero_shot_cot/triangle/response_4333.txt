Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 8.
6. Node 6 is connected to node 1.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.

Let's analyze the triangles:
- For node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 4, 7)
- For node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 7), (1, 4, 8)
- For node 2: No triangle as it's connected to only 2 nodes.
- For node 3: No triangle as it's connected to only 2 nodes.
- For node 4: (4, 0, 7), (4, 1, 7), (4, 1, 8)
- For node 6: No triangle as it's connected to only 1 node.
- For node 7: (7, 0, 4), (7, 1, 4), (7, 1, 9)
- For node 8: No triangle as it's connected to only 3 nodes.
- For node 9: No triangle as it's connected to only 2 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8] as listed below:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<4, 0, 7>
<4, 1, 7>
<7, 0, 4>
