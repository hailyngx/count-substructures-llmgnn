Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each combination of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 5>
<6, 4, 5>
<6, 4, 9>
<6, 5, 9>
<6, 0, 7>
<8, 9, 6>

There are a total of [9] triangles in the graph.
