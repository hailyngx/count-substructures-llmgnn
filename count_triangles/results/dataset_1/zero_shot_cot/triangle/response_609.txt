Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Check all possible triangles by examining each node pair.
Possible triangles involving node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 9)
Possible triangles involving node 1: (1, 2, 3)
Possible triangles involving node 2: (2, 5, 8), (2, 6, 9)
Possible triangles involving node 3: (3, 7, 8)
Possible triangles involving node 4: (4, 8, 0)
Possible triangles involving node 5: (5, 8, 2)
Possible triangles involving node 6: None
Possible triangles involving node 7: None
Possible triangles involving node 8: None
Possible triangles involving node 9: None

Step 2: List the unique triangles we found.
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 8>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of triangles.
Total number of triangles: [6]
