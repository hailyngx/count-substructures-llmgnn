Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
On analyzing the given graph, we can calculate the total number of triangles present:

1. **Node 0**: Neighbors - 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
   - <0, 1, 3>
   - <0, 4, 6>
   - <0, 7, 9>
   
2. **Node 1**: Neighbors - 0, 3
   - No triangle can be formed with only two neighbors.
   
3. **Node 2**: Neighbors - 4, 6, 9
   - No triangle can be formed with only two neighbors.
   
4. **Node 3**: Neighbors - 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
   - <3, 1, 0>
   
5. **Node 4**: Neighbors - 0, 2, 6, 9
   - <4, 0, 6>
   - <4, 6, 2>
   - <4, 9, 0>
   
6. **Node 5**: Neighbors - 3
   - No triangle can be formed with only one neighbor.
   
7. **Node 6**: Neighbors - 0, 2, 4
   - No new triangle can be formed as all triangles including node 6 are already covered.
   
8. **Node 7**: Neighbors - 0, 3, 9
   - <7, 0, 9>
   
9. **Node 8**: Neighbors - 0, 3, 5
   - No triangle can be formed with only two neighbors.
   
10. **Node 9**: Neighbors - 0, 2, 4, 7
    - <9, 0, 4>
    - <9, 4, 2>
    - <9, 7, 0>
    
Adding up all the triangles found, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **[11]**.
