Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step by step:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to node 7.
6. Node 6 is connected to node 4.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to node 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
1. <1, 3, 7>
2. <1, 4, 7>
3. <2, 3, 7>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <3, 4, 7>
6. <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
