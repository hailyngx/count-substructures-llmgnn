Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by three connected nodes.

From the given edges, we can identify the triangles as follows:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
