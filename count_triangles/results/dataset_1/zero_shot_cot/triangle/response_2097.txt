Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 5. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, and <1, 5, 9>.
