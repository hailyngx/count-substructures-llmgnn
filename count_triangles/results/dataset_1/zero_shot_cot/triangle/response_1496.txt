Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 0.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7.

To find all possible triangles, we need to check all triplets of nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go through the pairs:
- (0, 5, 6)
- (0, 5, 8)
- (0, 5, 9)
- (0, 6, 8)
- (0, 6, 9)
- (0, 8, 9)
- (1, 2, 9)
- (2, 4, 6)
- (2, 6, 8)
- (2, 6, 9)
- (2, 8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>.
