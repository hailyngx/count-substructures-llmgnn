Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Identify all possible triangles by examining each combination of three nodes connected by edges.
2. Count the number of unique triangles found.

After examining the provided edges, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
