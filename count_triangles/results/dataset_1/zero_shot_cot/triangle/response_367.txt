Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's enumerate each triangle and then count the total number of triangles in the end.

The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
1. <0, 2, 1>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 2, 8>
4. <1, 2, 0>
5. <1, 2, 3>
6. <1, 2, 5>
7. <1, 2, 7>
8. <2, 0, 6>
9. <2, 0, 8>
10. <2, 1, 3>
11. <8, 0, 4>
12. <8, 0, 9>
13. <2, 1, 5>
14. <0, 8, 4>
15. <0, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.
