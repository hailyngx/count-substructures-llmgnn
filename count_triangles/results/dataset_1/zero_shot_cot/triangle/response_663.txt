Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all unique sets of three nodes that are connected by edges to form triangles.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 1, 8>
4. <0, 1, 9>
5. <0, 4, 5>
6. <0, 4, 8>
7. <0, 4, 9>
8. <1, 4, 7>
9. <1, 4, 9>
10. <1, 5, 9>
11. <4, 6, 7>
12. <4, 6, 9>
13. <4, 7, 9>
14. <5, 6, 9>

Counting the triangles, we find that there are a total of 14 triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, the answer is: [14].
