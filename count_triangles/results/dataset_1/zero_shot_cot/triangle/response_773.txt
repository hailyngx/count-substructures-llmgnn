Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 9, 5>
<1, 0, 8>
<1, 0, 9>
<1, 8, 2>
<1, 9, 5>
<2, 0, 8>
<8, 0, 9>
<8, 1, 2>
<9, 0, 5>
<9, 0, 6>
<9, 1, 5>
<9, 3, 7>
<9, 5, 7>
<9, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
