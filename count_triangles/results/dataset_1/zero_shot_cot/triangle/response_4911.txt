Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Identify all the triangles:
   - Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
     - Triangles involving node 0: <0, 4, 8>
     - Triangles involving node 1: No new triangles found
     - Triangles involving node 2: No new triangles found
     - Triangles involving node 3: No new triangles found
     - Triangles involving node 4: No new triangles found
     - Triangles involving node 6: <6, 2, 7>, <6, 7, 9>
     - Triangles involving node 7: No new triangles found

2. Count the total number of triangles: [2]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 8> and <6, 2, 7>.
