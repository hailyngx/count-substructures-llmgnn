Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4, forming a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8, but these connections do not form a triangle.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 5, forming a potential triangle.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, and 9, where triangles <0, 3, 4> and <3, 4, 8> are formed.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 7, but we already counted the triangle with node 0.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 2 but does not form a triangle.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8, forming a potential triangle.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6, but we already counted the triangle with node 1.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6, forming a potential triangle.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 3 but does not form a triangle.

Therefore, we have found the following unique triangles:
- Triangles <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle <3, 4, 8>
- Triangle <1, 6, 8>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
