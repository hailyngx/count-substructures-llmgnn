Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Calculating the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Look for nodes that form triangles:
   - Nodes 0, 2, 6 form a triangle as they are connected to each other.
   - Nodes 1, 3, 7 form a triangle as they are connected to each other.

2. Count the total number of triangles:
   - There are 2 triangles in the given graph.
