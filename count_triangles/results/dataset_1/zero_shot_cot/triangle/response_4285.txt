Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. 
A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's find the triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 6, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 7, 4>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 5>
4. Triangle <2, 3, 0>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
6. Triangle <3, 0, 2>
7. Triangle <7, 1, 6>
8. Triangle <7, 1, 8>
9. Triangle <7, 4, 5>
10. Triangle <8, 1, 6>

Thus, there are 10 triangles in total in the given graph. So, the output is:
[10]
