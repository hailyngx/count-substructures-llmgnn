Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible triangles formed by the edges provided. We'll look for unique triangles and avoid counting them more than once.

Let's list all the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 2, 8>
4. <0, 3, 5>
5. <0, 5, 8>
6. <2, 3, 5>
7. <3, 5, 8>
8. <3, 6, 8>
9. <4, 9, 8>
10. <6, 7, 8>
11. <8, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
