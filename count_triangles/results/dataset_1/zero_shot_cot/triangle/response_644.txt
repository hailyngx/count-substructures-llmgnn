Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles present in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 5>
<5, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [5].
