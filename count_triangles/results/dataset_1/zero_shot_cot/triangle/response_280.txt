Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph.
From the given edges, we can see the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 9, 7>
4. <4, 5, 7>
5. <4, 6, 7>
6. <4, 6, 8>
7. <5, 6, 7>
8. <5, 6, 8>
9. <7, 8, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.
There are 9 unique triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
