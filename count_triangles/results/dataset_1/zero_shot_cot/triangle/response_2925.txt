Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected.

Given the edges provided:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to node 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to node 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
3. Triangle <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
