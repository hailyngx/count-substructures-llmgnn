Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of triangles.

To find a triangle, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Check each node to see if there are two edges that connect it to other nodes, creating a triangle.

2. Calculate the total number of triangles.

Let's proceed with finding the triangles.
