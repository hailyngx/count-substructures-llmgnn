Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected by edges.

Let's list down the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 5, 4>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 7, 8>
4. <1, 3, 2>
5. <1, 3, 4>
6. <1, 6, 8>
7. <2, 3, 4>
8. <2, 3, 9>
9. <3, 4, 5>
10. <5, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
