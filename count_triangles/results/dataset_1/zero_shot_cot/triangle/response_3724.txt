Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find and count the triangles:

1. Nodes directly connected:
    - (2, 3, 7)
    - (2, 3, 8)
    - (2, 7, 8)
    - (3, 4, 5)
    - (3, 7, 9)
    - (3, 8, 9)
    - (5, 6, 5)
    - (7, 8, 9)

2. Triangles formed by the above connections:
    - <2, 3, 7>
    - <2, 3, 8>
    - <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
