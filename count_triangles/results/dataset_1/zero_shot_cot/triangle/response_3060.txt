Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the given graph by looking for nodes that form triangles.

1. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 7>

Hence, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
