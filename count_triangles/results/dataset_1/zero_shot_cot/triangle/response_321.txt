Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
From the given graph, we can identify the triangles by looking for nodes that are interconnected with each other. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <4, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in total in the given graph. So, the output is [3].
