Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
For a triangle to exist in a graph, we need three nodes connected to each other forming a closed loop. To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Analyze each node's neighbors to see if there are any triangles involving that node.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles in the graph.

Let's go through each node to identify the triangles:
- Node 0: <0, 1, 3>
- Node 1: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 8>
- Node 2: <0, 2, 1>, <2, 8, 6>
- Node 3: <0, 3, 7>
- Node 4: <4, 6, 1>
- Node 5: <7, 5, 9>
- Node 6: <6, 1, 4>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 8, 7>
- Node 7: <7, 3, 0>, <7, 4, 6>, <7, 4, 5>, <7, 5, 9>, <7, 8, 2>, <7, 8, 6>
- Node 8: <8, 2, 1>, <8, 2, 6>, <8, 6, 1>, <8, 6, 7>
- Node 9: No triangle as it has no neighbors.

Counting the unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <0, 2, 1>
- <2, 8, 6>
- <6, 1, 4>
- <6, 8, 2>
- <6, 8, 7>
- <7, 3, 0>
- <7, 4, 6>
- <7, 4, 5>
- <7, 5, 9>
- <7, 8, 2>
- <7, 8, 6>

Total number of triangles: [13]
