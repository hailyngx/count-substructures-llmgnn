Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Let's list all the triangles in the graph:

- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 3)
- Triangle 2: (0, 1, 4)
- Triangle 3: (1, 2, 8)
- Triangle 4: (1, 2, 9)
- Triangle 5: (3, 2, 0)
- Triangle 6: (4, 0, 1)
- Triangle 7: (4, 0, 9)
- Triangle 8: (4, 1, 9)
- Triangle 9: (4, 5, 9)
- Triangle 10: (5, 4, 9)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles:

There are 10 triangles in total.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10]. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <3, 2, 0>, <4, 0, 1>, <4, 0, 9>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 4, 9>.
