Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this given graph is [18].  
The unique triangles found in this graph are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <5, 2, 6>, <8, 4, 9>, <9, 2, 8>.
