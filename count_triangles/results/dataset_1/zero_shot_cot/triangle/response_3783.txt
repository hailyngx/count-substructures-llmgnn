Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we can start by identifying the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
- Triangle 2: (2, 4, 6)
- Triangle 3: (0, 5, 6)
- Triangle 4: (0, 7, 2)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
