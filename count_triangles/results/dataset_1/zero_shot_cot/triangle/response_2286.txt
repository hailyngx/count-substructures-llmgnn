Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the graph by identifying all possible connections between nodes. Then, we will count the unique triangles.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <2, 6, 7>

Now, counting the total number of triangles within brackets:
[2]
