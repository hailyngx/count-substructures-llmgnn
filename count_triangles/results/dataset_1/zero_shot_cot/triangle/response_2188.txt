Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for loops of length 3, which are triangles. 

Let's start by listing the triangles found in this graph:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 6, 2>
<0, 7, 3>
<2, 8, 9>
<9, 1, 5>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles within brackets []:
