Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
2. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
3. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
