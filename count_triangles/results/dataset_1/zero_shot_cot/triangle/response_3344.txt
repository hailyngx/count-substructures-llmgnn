Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all triangles in the graph.

- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 4)
- Triangle 2: (0, 1, 5)
- Triangle 3: (1, 4, 2)
- Triangle 4: (1, 4, 3)
- Triangle 5: (1, 5, 3)
- Triangle 6: (2, 3, 4)
- Triangle 7: (3, 5, 6)
- Triangle 8: (9, 7, 2)

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles.

Total number of triangles = 8

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
