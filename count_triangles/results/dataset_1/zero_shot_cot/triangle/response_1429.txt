Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected (i.e., form a triangle). Let's start by listing unique triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <1, 4, 6>
5. <1, 4, 8>
6. <1, 5, 8>
7. <1, 6, 8>
8. <1, 8, 9>
9. <3, 2, 8>
10. <3, 6, 8>

Now, counting the total number of triangles inside brackets: [10].
