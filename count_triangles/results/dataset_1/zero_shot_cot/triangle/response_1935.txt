Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three vertices that form a triangle.

Let's list out the triangles in the graph:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 9, 4>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 3>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 8, 6>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 9, 1>
<5, 8, 6>
<5, 8, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<8, 3, 4>
<8, 4, 5>
<8, 4, 6>
<8, 4, 7>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles.
There are a total of [19] triangles in the given graph.
