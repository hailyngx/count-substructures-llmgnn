Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Nodes with their connected neighbors:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7}

2. Triangles in the graph:
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 9>

3. Count of triangles: [7]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 7.
