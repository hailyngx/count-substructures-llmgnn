Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 3, 1>
2. <0, 3, 2>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <0, 3, 7>
5. <0, 5, 4>
6. <0, 5, 7>
7. <1, 3, 2>
8. <1, 3, 6>
9. <2, 3, 4>
10. <2, 3, 7>
11. <4, 3, 5>
12. <4, 3, 6>
13. <4, 5, 6>
14. <5, 3, 7>
15. <6, 3, 7>
16. <6, 4, 7>
17. <6, 4, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
