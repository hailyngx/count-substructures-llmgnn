Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The triangle in a graph occurs when three nodes are connected by edges to each other forming a closed loop. To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each possible combination of three nodes and check if there is an edge between each pair of nodes.

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. Nodes connected to each other (0, 9), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 8), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 2).

2. Let's list down the unique triangles that can be formed:
   - <3, 5, 8>
   - <6, 1, 7>
   - <6, 3, 5>
   - <8, 3, 6>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
