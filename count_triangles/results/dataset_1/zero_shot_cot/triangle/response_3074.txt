Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we will iterate through all possible combinations of three nodes and check if there is an edge between each pair of nodes in the combination. If there is an edge between each pair, then we have found a triangle.

Here are the unique triangles present in the given graph:

<0, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 4, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
