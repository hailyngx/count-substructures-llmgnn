Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by three nodes connected to each other. Let's go through each node pair and check if there is a third node that completes the triangle.

Nodes connected to each other:
(0, 3, 8)
(0, 3, 9)
(0, 8, 4)
(1, 2, 7)
(1, 5, 7)
(2, 1, 7)
(3, 4, 9)
(4, 6, 7)
(4, 7, 5)
(5, 8, 7)
(6, 7, 9)

The total number of triangles found is [4]. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, and <4, 7, 5>.
