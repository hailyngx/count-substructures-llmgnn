Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 2, 7)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 3, 7)
3. Triangle 3: (0, 4, 9)
4. Triangle 4: (2, 3, 7)
5. Triangle 5: (2, 3, 9)
6. Triangle 6: (2, 4, 9)
7. Triangle 7: (3, 4, 7)
8. Triangle 8: (3, 4, 9)
9. Triangle 9: (5, 6, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph.

Total number of triangles: [9]
