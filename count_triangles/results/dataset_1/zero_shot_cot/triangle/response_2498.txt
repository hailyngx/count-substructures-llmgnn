Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes connected by edges. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <2, 6, 8>
4. <2, 8, 4>
5. <3, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
