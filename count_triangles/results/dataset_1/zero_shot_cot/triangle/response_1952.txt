Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes. Let's list all the triangles step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles:
   - <0, 3, 9>
   - <0, 3, 8>
   - <0, 3, 2>
   - <0, 3, 7>
   - <0, 8, 4>
   - <2, 3, 9>
   - <2, 3, 7>
   - <2, 3, 6>
   - <2, 6, 5>
   - <4, 7, 5>

2. Count the total number of triangles: [9]
