Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to find all the sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Looking at the given edges, each edge represents a connection between two nodes. We can start by examining each node and its neighboring nodes to identify any triangles.

2. Let's list the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 3, 7>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 3, 8>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 7, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 2, 5>
   - Triangle 5: <1, 5, 7>
   - Triangle 6: <1, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 7: <1, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 8: <1, 6, 8>
   - Triangle 9: <2, 1, 8>
   - Triangle 10: <3, 0, 8>
   - Triangle 11: <4, 7, 5>
   - Triangle 12: <4, 8, 5>
   - Triangle 13: <4, 8, 7>
   - Triangle 14: <7, 0, 8>

3. Counting the total number of unique triangles: [14]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 14.
