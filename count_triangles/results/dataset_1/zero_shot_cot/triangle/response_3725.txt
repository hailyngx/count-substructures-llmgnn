Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the connected nodes. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Let's list all unique triangles in this graph:

1. <1, 4, 2>
2. <1, 4, 8>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <3, 5, 0>
5. <8, 4, 2>
6. <8, 4, 6>
7. <8, 4, 1>
8. <8, 6, 1>
9. <8, 6, 7>
10. <8, 6, 9>
11. <8, 1, 6>
12. <8, 1, 4>
13. <8, 1, 7>
14. <8, 1, 9>
15. <8, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are **15 triangles** in total. [<15>]
