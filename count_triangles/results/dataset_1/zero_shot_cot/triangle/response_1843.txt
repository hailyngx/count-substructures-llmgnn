Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a triangle whenever there is a set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 
Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <2, 7, 8>
2. <2, 7, 9>

Count the unique triangles: [2]
