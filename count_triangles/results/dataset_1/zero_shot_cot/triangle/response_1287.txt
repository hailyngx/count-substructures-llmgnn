Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the set of unique triangles based on the provided edges. 

Let's check the triangles:

1. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
2. Triangle <2, 8, 5>
3. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <4, 7, 4>
6. Triangle <8, 2, 5>
7. Triangle <8, 2, 9>
8. Triangle <8, 5, 2>
9. Triangle <8, 5, 9>
10. Triangle <9, 2, 8>
11. Triangle <9, 2, 5>
12. Triangle <9, 8, 2>
13. Triangle <9, 8, 5>

There are 13 triangles in total in this graph. 

Therefore, the answer is: [13].
