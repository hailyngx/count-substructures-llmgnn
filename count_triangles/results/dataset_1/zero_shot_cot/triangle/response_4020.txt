Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected by edges to each other. In other words, we are looking for closed loops of length 3 within the graph.

Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. List all the triangles:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle 3: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 4: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 5: <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle 6: <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle 7: <1, 8, 3>
- Triangle 8: <2, 5, 3>
- Triangle 9: <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle 10: <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle 11: <3, 7, 4>
- Triangle 12: <4, 7, 6>
- Triangle 13: <5, 9, 4>
- Triangle 14: <5, 9, 6>
- Triangle 15: <6, 7, 4>
- Triangle 16: <9, 4, 7>

2. Count the total number of triangles: [16]

So, there are 16 triangles in the given graph.
