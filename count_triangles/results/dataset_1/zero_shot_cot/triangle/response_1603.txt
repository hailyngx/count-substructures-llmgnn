Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we have to look for sets of three nodes that form a triangle.

Let's go through the graph and identify the triangles:

1. Triangle: <0, 4, 7>
2. Triangle: <0, 4, 8>
3. Triangle: <4, 7, 9>
4. Triangle: <6, 7, 9>

Even though there are edges between other nodes (e.g., between nodes 2 and 6), they do not form triangles in this particular graph configuration.

Therefore, the total number of triangles present in the graph is [4].
