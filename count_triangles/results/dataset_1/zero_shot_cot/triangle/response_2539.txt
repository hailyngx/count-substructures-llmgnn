Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected to each other. Here is the step-by-step process to count the triangles in this graph:

1. Identify all the triangles in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 3, 5)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 2, 7)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 4, 8)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 6: (3, 6, 8)

2. Count the total number of triangles: [6]

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
