Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Checking Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to Node 2. Let's see if a triangle is formed with these connections.

2. Checking Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Let's see if any triangles are formed with these connections.

3. Checking Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 4, and 9. Let's see if any triangles are formed with these connections.

4. Checking Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1, 7, and 8. Let's see if any triangles are formed with these connections.

5. Checking Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1 and 2. Let's see if a triangle is formed with these connections.

6. Checking Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1 and 6. Let's see if a triangle is formed with these connections.

7. Checking Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1 and 5. Let's see if a triangle is formed with these connections.

8. Checking Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, and 8. Let's see if any triangles are formed with these connections.

9. Checking Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to Nodes 3, 7, and 9. Let's see if any triangles are formed with these connections.

10. Checking Node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to Nodes 2 and 8. Let's see if a triangle is formed with these connections.

After checking all the nodes and their connections, we find the following unique triangles:
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 4, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
