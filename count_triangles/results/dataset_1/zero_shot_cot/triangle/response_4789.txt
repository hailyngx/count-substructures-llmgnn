Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
From the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we'll now calculate the total number of triangles.

Let's identify the triangles step by step:
1. Nodes connected with triangle edges:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 3, 6)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 3, 5)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 4: (2, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 8, 9)

Now, we count the total number of triangles. We have found 5 unique triangles. So, the output will be:
Total number of triangles: [5]
