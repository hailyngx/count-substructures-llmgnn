Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a more readable format:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 2
- Node 6 is connected to node 3
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to node 8

To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

Now, let's list down the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 5, 2>
3. <1, 3, 8>
4. <1, 8, 3>
5. <2, 5, 1>
6. <3, 1, 8>
7. <5, 1, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
