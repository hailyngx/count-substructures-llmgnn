Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 8>.
