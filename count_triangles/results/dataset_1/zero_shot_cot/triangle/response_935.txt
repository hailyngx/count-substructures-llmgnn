Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's find the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 6.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
9. Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Let's now count the triangles:

1. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
