Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles formed by the given edges.
1. Look for nodes that have common neighbors to form triangles.
2. Count the number of triangles and list them uniquely within <>.

Triangular cycles found:
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 4>
<3, 7, 5>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 3>
<8, 4, 6>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles found.
Total number of triangles: [10]
