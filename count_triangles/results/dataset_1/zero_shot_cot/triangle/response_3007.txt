Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: First, let's list all the triangles in the given graph.
Triplet triangles:
- (0, 3, 4)
- (3, 4, 5)
- (3, 4, 6)
- (3, 4, 7)
- (3, 6, 8)

Step 2: Now, let's count the total number of triangles.
Total number of triangles: [5]
