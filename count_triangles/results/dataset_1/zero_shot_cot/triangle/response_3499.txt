Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, the triangles in this graph can be determined by finding the loops of length 3. Here, we will list the triangles and count them.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <1, 4, 8>
2. <1, 7, 9>
3. <1, 8, 9>
4. <3, 7, 8>
5. <4, 6, 8>
6. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
