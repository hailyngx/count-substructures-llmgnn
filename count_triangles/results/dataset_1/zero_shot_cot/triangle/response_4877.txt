Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Write down all the triangles in the graph by examining each node.

0: (0, 4, 7)
1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 9, 2)
2: (2, 1, 4), (2, 3, 7), (2, 8, 7), (2, 9, 1), (2, 9, 3)
3: (3, 2, 9), (3, 6, 9)
4: (4, 0, 1)
5: No triangles
6: (6, 3, 9), (6, 5, 7), (6, 7, 9)
7: (7, 0, 4), (7, 2, 8), (7, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9), (7, 9, 2)
8: No triangles
9: (9, 1, 2), (9, 2, 3), (9, 3, 6), (9, 6, 7), (9, 7, 8)

Step 2: Count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles.

Total number of triangles: [15]
Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 8, 7>
<2, 9, 1>
<2, 9, 3>
<3, 2, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 0, 1>
<6, 3, 9>
<6, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
