Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step to find the total number of triangles:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
3. Node 2: Neighbor {4}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 9}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {4, 7}

Now, we can identify the triangles:
1. Triangles involving Node 0: {0, 1, 4}, {0, 3, 8}
2. Triangles involving Node 1: {0, 1, 4}, {1, 3, 7}
3. Triangles involving Node 3: {0, 3, 8}, {1, 3, 7}
4. Triangle involving Node 4: {1, 4, 8}

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 8>, and <1, 3, 7>.
