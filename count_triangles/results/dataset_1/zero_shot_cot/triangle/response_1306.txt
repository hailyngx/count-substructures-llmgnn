Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here are the steps to find the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
2. For each pair of neighbors of node 0, we check if there is an edge between them to form a triangle. We find triangles: <0, 1, 4> and <0, 7, 4>.
3. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
4. For node 1, the only triangle is found with node 0 and 4: <0, 1, 4>.
5. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 4. However, there is no triangle involving node 2.
6. Node 3 only has a connection with node 6 and no triangles can be formed with it.
7. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8.
8. For node 4, we find triangles: <0, 1, 4> and <0, 7, 4>.
9. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 6 with no triangles involving it.
10. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5 with no triangles involving it.
11. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9.
12. For node 7, we find a triangle: <0, 7, 4>.
13. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 4. However, there is no triangle involving node 8.
14. Node 9 is connected to node 7 but no triangles can be formed with it.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4> and <0, 7, 4>.
