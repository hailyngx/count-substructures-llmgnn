Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can count the number of triangles by examining each unique combination of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can find triangles by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular pattern.

Below are the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 8, 9>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <4, 5, 9>
5. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
