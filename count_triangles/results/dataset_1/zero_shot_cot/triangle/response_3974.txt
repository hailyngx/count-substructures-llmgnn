Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <7, 8, 9>.
