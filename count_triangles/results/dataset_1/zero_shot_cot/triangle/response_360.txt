Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are interconnected forming a triangle. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 7, 4>
3. <1, 8, 4>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <4, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
