Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
By counting triangles in the given graph, we will identify the unique triangles and then provide the total number of triangles.

Observations:
- A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.
- To count the total number of triangles, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other.

Now, let's list the unique triangles in this graph:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <1, 2, 3>
3. <1, 2, 7>
4. <1, 3, 5>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <2, 8, 9>
7. <4, 5, 8>
8. <4, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles in the graph is: [8]
