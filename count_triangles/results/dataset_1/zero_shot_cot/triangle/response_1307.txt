Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we'll look for all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Let's start by listing all the unique triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <1, 3, 4>
5. <3, 4, 8>
6. <4, 5, 8>
7. <5, 7, 9>
8. <5, 7, 0>
9. <5, 8, 0>
10. <5, 8, 3>
11. <7, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
