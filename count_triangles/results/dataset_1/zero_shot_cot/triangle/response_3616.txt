Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided.

Given Edges:
- (0, 3), (0, 6), (3, 1), (6, 9), (8, 1), (8, 9)

We can see the following triangles in this graph:
1. <0, 3, 1>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <1, 3, 8>
4. <1, 4, 8>
5. <2, 5, 9>
6. <6, 0, 9>
7. <8, 1, 9>

Therefore, there are total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
