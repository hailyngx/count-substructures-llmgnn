Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <6, 7, 9>.
