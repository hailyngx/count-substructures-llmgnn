Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, and <5, 6, 9>.
