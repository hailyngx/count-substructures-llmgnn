Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Check for triangles involving node 0:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 3, 4)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 4, 7)

2. Check for triangles involving node 1:
   - No triangles can be formed with node 1.

3. Check for triangles involving node 2:
   - No triangles can be formed with node 2.

4. Check for triangles involving node 3:
   - No triangles can be formed with node 3.

5. Check for triangles involving node 4:
   - No new triangles can be formed with node 4.

6. Check for triangles involving node 6:
   - No triangles can be formed with node 6.

7. Check for triangles involving node 7:
   - No new triangles can be formed with node 7.

8. Check for triangles involving node 8:
   - No new triangles can be formed with node 8.

9. Check for triangles involving node 9:
   - No triangles can be formed with node 9.

Now, counting the total number of unique triangles: 
   - Total number of triangles = 3

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, and <0, 4, 7>.
