Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Since this graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's find the number of triangles present in this graph.

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
6. Triangle <5, 8, 9>
7. Triangle <8, 9, 1>
8. Triangle <8, 9, 2>
9. Triangle <8, 9, 5>
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
