Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle. Here are the triangles in the given graph:

1. <1, 4, 3>
2. <1, 4, 6>
3. <1, 5, 3>
4. <1, 5, 8>
5. <1, 9, 6>
6. <3, 4, 6>
7. <3, 4, 5>
8. <3, 5, 8>
9. <4, 6, 8>
10. <5, 3, 8>
11. <5, 6, 8>
12. <6, 8, 5>
13. <9, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
