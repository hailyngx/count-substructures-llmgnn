Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the graph by checking all possible combinations of nodes that can form a triangle:

1. (0, 2, 6)
2. (1, 2, 4)
3. (1, 2, 6)
4. (2, 4, 8)
5. (2, 5, 8)
6. (3, 4, 8)
7. (2, 4, 8)
8. (2, 5, 8)

Counting the unique triangles listed above, we find that there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
