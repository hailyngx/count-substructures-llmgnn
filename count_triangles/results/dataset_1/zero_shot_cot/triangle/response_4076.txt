Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all interconnected.

Identify the triangles:

1. Nodes (0, 1, 6) form a triangle.
2. Nodes (1, 3, 5) form a triangle.
3. Nodes (1, 4, 7) form a triangle.
4. Nodes (1, 4, 8) form a triangle.
5. Nodes (1, 5, 7) form a triangle.
6. Nodes (3, 5, 7) form a triangle.
7. Nodes (4, 8, 9) form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 8, 9>
