Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of nodes that form triangles. Let's start by listing all the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 3>
3. <0, 2, 4>
4. <0, 4, 7>
5. <0, 8, 9>
6. <1, 2, 4>
7. <1, 3, 4>
8. <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
