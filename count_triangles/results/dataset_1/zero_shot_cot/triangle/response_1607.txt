Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Here are the steps to find the number of triangles:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <2, 3, 5>
3. <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
