Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will examine all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Let's count the triangles step-by-step:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 6, 4>
4. <1, 5, 2>
5. <1, 5, 8>
6. <1, 9, 2>
7. <2, 3, 5>
8. <2, 4, 3>
9. <2, 4, 6>
10. <2, 5, 8>
11. <2, 8, 9>
12. <3, 4, 5>
13. <4, 6, 0>
14. <4, 6, 7>
15. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 15 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the output is:
