Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Check each possible triangle formed by the nodes:
   - Possible triangles involving node 0: (0, 5, 6), (0, 7, 2), (0, 9, 4)
   - Possible triangles involving node 1: (1, 3, 1), (1, 8, 4)
   - Possible triangles involving node 2: (2, 7, 6), (2, 9, 4)
   - Possible triangles involving node 3: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 4: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 5: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 6: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 7: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 8: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 9: None

2. Counting the unique triangles:
   - <0, 5, 6>
   - <0, 7, 2>
   - <0, 9, 4>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
