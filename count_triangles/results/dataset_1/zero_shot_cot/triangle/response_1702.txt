Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The unique triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
