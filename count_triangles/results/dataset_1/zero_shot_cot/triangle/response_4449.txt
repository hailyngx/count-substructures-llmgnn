Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are interconnected with each other. Since counting manually can be tedious, we can go through a step-by-step process:

1. Node 0 is connected to Node 2 and Node 2 is connected to Node 7. Therefore, we have a triangle <0, 2, 7>.
2. Node 1 is connected to Node 8 and Node 8 is also connected to Node 3. However, Node 1 and Node 3 are not connected directly, so there are no triangles involving nodes 1 and 3.
3. Node 4 is connected to Node 8, Node 8 is connected to Node 5, and Node 5 is connected to Node 4. Therefore, we have a triangle <4, 5, 8>.
4. Node 5 and Node 6 are connected bidirectionally, forming a triangle <5, 6, 7>.
5. Node 8 and Node 9 do not form a triangle as they are not directly connected.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
