Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Analyzing the given graph to find the number of triangles in it:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8.

Let's now count the number of triangles in the graph. We will analyze each possible triangle formed by the edges:

1. Triangles involving node 0: Only one triangle <0, 3, 5>.
2. Triangles involving node 1: No triangles involving node 1.
3. Triangles involving node 2: Only one triangle <1, 2, 9>.
4. Triangles involving node 3: Two triangles <1, 3, 9> and <2, 3, 9>.
5. Triangles involving node 4: No triangles involving node 4.
6. Triangles involving node 5: No triangles involving node 5.
7. Triangles involving node 6: One triangle <0, 3, 6>.
8. Triangles involving node 7: No triangles involving node 7.
9. Triangles involving node 8: No triangles involving node 8.
10. Triangles involving node 9: One triangle <0, 3, 9>.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is 5. 

Therefore, the answer is [5].
