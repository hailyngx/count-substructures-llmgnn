Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can count the number of triangles step-by-step:
1. For each node, identify the neighbors it is connected to (nodes with a direct edge).

For node 0: Neighbors are 4 and 9
For node 1: Neighbors are 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9
For node 2: Neighbors are 3, 4, and 7
For node 3: Neighbors are 2, 4, and 5
For node 4: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, and 3
For node 5: Neighbors are 1, 3, and 6
For node 6: Neighbor is 5
For node 7: Neighbors are 1, 2, 8, and 9
For node 8: Neighbors are 1, 7, and 9
For node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 7, and 8

2. Now, for each node, check if any pair of its neighbors is connected directly. If they are, then a triangle is formed.

The triangles are:
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<7, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
