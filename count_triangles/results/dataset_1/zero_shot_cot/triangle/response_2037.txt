Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the edges in the graph. A triangle is formed by three nodes that are connected in a closed loop.

From the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to node 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.

Let's now find the triangles in the given graph:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 4, 5>
4. <2, 4, 5>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <4, 7, 8>
7. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
