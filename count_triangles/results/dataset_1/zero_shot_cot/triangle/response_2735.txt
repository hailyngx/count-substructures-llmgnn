Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
4. Node 4 is connected to node 1.
5. Node 5 is connected to node 8.
6. Node 6 is connected to node 7 and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to node 6.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6.

Let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <1, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
