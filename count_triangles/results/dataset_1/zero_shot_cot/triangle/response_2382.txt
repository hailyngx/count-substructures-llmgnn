Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. 

1. Node 0:
   - (0, 2, 7)
   - (0, 6, 1)
   - (0, 8, 1)
   - (0, 8, 5)
   
2. Node 1:
   - (1, 4, 7)
   - (1, 6, 0)
   - (1, 8, 0)
   - (1, 9, 3)
   
3. Node 2:
   - (2, 0, 7)
   
4. Node 3:
   - (3, 9, 1)
   
5. Node 4:
   - (4, 1, 7)
   - (4, 5, 8)
   
6. Node 5:
   - (5, 4, 8)
   
7. Node 6:
   - (6, 0, 1)
   - (6, 1, 7)
   
8. Node 7:
   - (7, 2, 0)
   - (7, 4, 1)
   - (7, 6, 1)
   - (7, 8, 5)
   
9. Node 8:
   - (8, 0, 1)
   - (8, 5, 4)
   - (8, 7, 4)
   
10. Node 9:
   - (9, 1, 3)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 9, 3>, and <4, 5, 8>.
