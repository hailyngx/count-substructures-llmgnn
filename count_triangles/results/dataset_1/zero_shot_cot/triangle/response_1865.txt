Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every possible triangle formed by three connected nodes. Let's list the triangles:

1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <2, 6, 7>
3. <4, 5, 9>
4. <4, 8, 9>
5. <5, 6, 9>
6. <6, 7, 9>
7. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
