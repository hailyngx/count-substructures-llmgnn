Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first identify all the triangles in the graph by looking for cycles of length 3. 

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <2, 3, 8>
4. <3, 4, 6>
5. <3, 6, 7>
6. <3, 6, 9>
7. <3, 7, 9>
8. <3, 8, 2>
9. <4, 5, 6>

There are 9 triangles in total. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
