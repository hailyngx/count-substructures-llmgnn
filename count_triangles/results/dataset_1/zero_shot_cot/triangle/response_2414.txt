Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node
- Node 0: degree = 6
- Node 1: degree = 3
- Node 2: degree = 2
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 3
- Node 5: degree = 5
- Node 6: degree = 1
- Node 7: degree = 2
- Node 8: degree = 2
- Node 9: degree = 4

Step 2: Identify triangles
- Since a triangle consists of three nodes connected by edges, we need to find nodes that are all connected to each other.

Possible Triangle Combinations:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 4, 5>
4. <3, 4, 5>
5. <0, 7, 8>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles
- Count the total number of unique triangles: [5]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
