Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles based on the given edges:
1. Triangle <0, 4, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 2>
4. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
6. Triangle <5, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [6]
