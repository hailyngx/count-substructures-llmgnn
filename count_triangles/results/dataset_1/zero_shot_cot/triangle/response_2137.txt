Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9

Edges:
(0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 5), (9, 6)

Let's count the number of triangles in this graph.
