Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here is the breakdown of the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
