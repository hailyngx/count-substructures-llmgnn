Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges, let's identify the triangles present in the graph.
Here are the triangles found in the graph:
- <0, 2, 9>
- <2, 1, 9>
- <2, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
