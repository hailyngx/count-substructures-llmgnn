Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that form a triangle, meaning there is an edge connecting each pair of nodes in the set.

Let's list the triangles first:
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Now we count the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = 10
