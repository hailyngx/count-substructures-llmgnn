Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step by step:
1.  First, let's list all the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 4, 7>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 6, 3>
   - Triangle 5: <0, 8, 1>
   - Triangle 6: <5, 3, 6>
   - Triangle 7: <8, 1, 9>
   - Triangle 8: <8, 5, 3>
   - Triangle 9: <8, 9, 1>
   
2.  Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph: [9]
