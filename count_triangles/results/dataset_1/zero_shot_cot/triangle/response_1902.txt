Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected to each other.

Let's go through the edges to identify the triangles:

1. (0, 8) - Does not form a triangle.
2. (1, 3) - Does not form a triangle.
3. (1, 5) - Does not form a triangle.
4. (2, 4) - Does not form a triangle.
5. (2, 5) - Does not form a triangle.
6. (2, 7) - Does not form a triangle.
7. (2, 9) - Does not form a triangle.
8. (3, 1) - Does not form a triangle.
9. (4, 2) - Does not form a triangle.
10. (4, 7) - Does not form a triangle.
11. (4, 9) - Does not form a triangle.
12. (5, 1) - Does not form a triangle.
13. (5, 2) - Does not form a triangle.
14. (5, 7) - Forms a triangle <2, 5, 7>.
15. (6, 8) - Does not form a triangle.
16. (6, 9) - Does not form a triangle.
17. (7, 2) - Does not form a triangle.
18. (7, 4) - Does not form a triangle.
19. (7, 5) - Forms a triangle <5, 7, 2>.
20. (8, 0) - Does not form a triangle.
21. (8, 6) - Does not form a triangle.
22. (9, 2) - Does not form a triangle.
23. (9, 4) - Does not form a triangle.
24. (9, 6) - Does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2, and the unique triangles found are <2, 5, 7> and <5, 7, 2>.

Thus, the answer is: [2]
