Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go through the combinations of nodes to identify the triangles:

1. Possible triangles involving node 0: 
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 6, 8>

2. Possible triangles involving node 1:
- No triangles as node 1 is not part of any triangles.

3. Possible triangles involving node 2:
- <2, 0, 1>
- <2, 0, 9>
- <2, 1, 9>

4. Possible triangles involving node 3:
- No triangles as node 3 is not part of any triangles.

5. Possible triangles involving node 4:
- <4, 0, 6>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 9>

6. Possible triangles involving node 5:
- No triangles as node 5 is not part of any triangles.

7. Possible triangles involving node 6:
- <6, 0, 1>
- <6, 0, 3>
- <6, 0, 4>
- <6, 0, 9>
- <6, 1, 9>
- <6, 3, 4>
- <6, 4, 7>
- <6, 9, 1>
- <6, 9, 4>

8. Possible triangles involving node 7:
- No triangles as node 7 is not part of any triangles.

9. Possible triangles involving node 8:
- No triangles as node 8 is not part of any triangles.

10. Possible triangles involving node 9:
- <9, 1, 2>
- <9, 1, 6>
- <9, 2, 3>
- <9, 2, 6>
- <9, 3, 4>
- <9, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
