Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph:

1. Look for each node that has connections to two other nodes forming a triangle.
2. Identify the triangles formed by these connections.

Triangles in the graph:
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 6, 1>
- <0, 6, 3>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 7, 1>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <2, 7, 4>
- <2, 9, 2>
- <5, 2, 7>
- <8, 3, 6>
- <8, 7, 1>
- <8, 7, 2>
- <8, 7, 4>

Now, count the total number of triangles: [14]
