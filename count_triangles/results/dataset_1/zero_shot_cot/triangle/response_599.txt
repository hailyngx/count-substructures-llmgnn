Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's start by looking at each possible triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges.

1. Possible triangle involving nodes 0, 2, and 4:
   - <0, 2, 4>

2. Possible triangle involving nodes 0, 2, and 5:
   - <0, 2, 5>

3. Possible triangle involving nodes 0, 4, and 5:
   - <0, 4, 5>

4. Possible triangle involving nodes 2, 4, and 5:
   - <2, 4, 5>

5. Possible triangle involving nodes 3, 5, and 8:
   - <3, 5, 8>

6. Possible triangle involving nodes 4, 5, and 7:
   - <4, 5, 7>

7. Possible triangle involving nodes 5, 7, and 8:
   - <5, 7, 8>

8. Possible triangle involving nodes 5, 8, and 9:
   - <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
