Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
By examining the given graph, we can identify the triangles within it by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's determine the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes 0, 2, and 3 form a triangle since there are edges connecting all three nodes: <0, 2, 3>.
2. Nodes 1, 5, and 6 form a triangle: <1, 5, 6>.
3. Nodes 2, 7, and 4 form a triangle: <2, 7, 4>.
4. Nodes 2, 7, and 1 form a triangle: <2, 7, 1>.
5. Nodes 5, 6, and 1 form a triangle: <5, 6, 1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
