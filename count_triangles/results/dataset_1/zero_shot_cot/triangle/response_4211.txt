Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges, we can determine the number of triangles in the graph by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's check for each possible triangle:

1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 6, and 5: (0, 6), (6, 5), (0, 5) - This forms a triangle.
2. Triangle involving nodes 1, 2, and 7: (1, 2), (2, 7), (1, 7) - This forms a triangle.
3. Triangle involving nodes 1, 2, and 4: (1, 2), (2, 4), (1, 4) - This forms a triangle.
4. Triangle involving nodes 1, 7, and 8: (1, 7), (7, 8), (1, 8) - This forms a triangle.
5. Triangle involving nodes 2, 4, and 9: (2, 4), (4, 9), (2, 9) - This forms a triangle.
6. Triangle involving nodes 5, 6, and 8: (5, 6), (6, 8), (5, 8) - This forms a triangle.

Hence, there are 6 triangles in this graph.
Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [6].
