Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at all the possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. 

Given the edges provided, we can list down the unique triangles:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <0, 3, 7>
5. <0, 3, 9>
6. <1, 3, 7>
7. <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
