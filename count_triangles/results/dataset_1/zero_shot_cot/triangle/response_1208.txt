Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].  
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 5>, <4, 6, 9>.
