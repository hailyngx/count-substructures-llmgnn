Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Look for nodes that form a triangle: To form a triangle, we need 3 nodes where each node is connected to the other two.

2. Check each combination of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <2, 3, 4>
4. <2, 4, 9>
5. <3, 5, 6>
6. <5, 8, 9>
7. <6, 8, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 7]
