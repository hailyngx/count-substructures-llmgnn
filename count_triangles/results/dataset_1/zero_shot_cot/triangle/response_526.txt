Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. 

Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 6, 7)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 4, 6)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 6, 7)
4. Triangle 4: (2, 4, 8)
5. Triangle 5: (3, 5, 9)
6. Triangle 6: (4, 5, 9)

Hence, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, and <4, 5, 9>.
