Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we will look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's start by listing the unique triangles:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 1>
3. <0, 2, 5>
4. <1, 2, 5>
5. <1, 2, 7>
6. <2, 5, 9>
7. <2, 3, 5>
8. <2, 5, 7>
9. <3, 4, 7>
10. <5, 7, 9>
11. <8, 9, 5>
12. <9, 8, 2>

Now, counting the total number of triangles, we get a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
