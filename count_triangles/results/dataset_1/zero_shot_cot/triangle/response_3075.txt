Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Triangles consist of three nodes connected by edges with all three nodes interconnected.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 6, 9>
2. <0, 7, 5>
3. <0, 9, 6>
4. <4, 5, 6>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <4, 5, 1>
7. <4, 8, 9>
8. <5, 6, 0>
9. <5, 6, 9>
10. <5, 7, 0>
11. <5, 7, 0>
12. <5, 7, 0>
13. <5, 7, 0>
14. <6, 0, 9>
15. <6, 5, 7>
16. <6, 9, 0>
17. <9, 0, 6>
18. <9, 4, 5>
19. <9, 4, 8>
20. <9, 6, 0>
21. <9, 6, 5>
22. <9, 6, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [22].
