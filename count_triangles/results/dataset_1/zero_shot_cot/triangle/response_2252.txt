Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in this graph, we can look for each unique triangle formed by three connected nodes. Let's calculate this step-by-step:

1. For each node, check if there are any triangles.
2. List the unique triangles found.
3. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <1, 2, 6>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <3, 4, 6>
7. <3, 6, 7>
8. <6, 4, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
