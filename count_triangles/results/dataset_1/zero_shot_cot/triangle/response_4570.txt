Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step to determine the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.

Now, let's list the unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
