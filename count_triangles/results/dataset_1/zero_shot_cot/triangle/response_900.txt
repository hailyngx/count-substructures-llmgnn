Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles that exist in the given graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 8, 3>
<4, 9, 3>
<5, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
