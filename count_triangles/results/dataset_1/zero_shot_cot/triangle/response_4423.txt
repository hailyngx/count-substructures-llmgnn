Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph
- To form a triangle, we need three nodes connected in such a way that each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Step 2: Check each group of three connected nodes to see if they form a triangle
1. (0, 2, 1) is a triangle
2. (0, 2, 5) is a triangle
3. (0, 2, 6) is a triangle
4. (0, 4, 5) is a triangle
5. (0, 4, 7) is a triangle
6. (0, 9, 4) is a triangle
7. (1, 2, 5) is a triangle
8. (1, 2, 6) is a triangle
9. (1, 5, 4) is a triangle
10. (2, 3, 6) is a triangle
11. (2, 5, 4) is a triangle
12. (2, 5, 7) is a triangle
13. (2, 6, 1) is a triangle
14. (2, 6, 3) is a triangle
15. (3, 4, 6) is a triangle
16. (4, 5, 7) is a triangle
17. (5, 7, 6) is a triangle

Total number of triangles: 17
