Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other forming a closed loop.

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <0, 5, 9>
2. <1, 2, 4>
3. <1, 2, 6>
4. <1, 5, 9>
5. <2, 4, 6>
6. <2, 5, 6>
7. <3, 5, 7>
8. <5, 6, 9>
9. <5, 7, 8>
10. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [10].
