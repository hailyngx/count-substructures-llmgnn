Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node pairs connected by an edge:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 6 and 9
   - Node 1: Connected to node 5
   - Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9
   - Node 3: Connected to node 7
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 2 and 8
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9
   - Node 6: Connected to node 0
   - Node 7: Connected to node 3
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 2 and 4
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5

2. Now, let's find the triangles in the graph:
   - <0, 2, 9>
   - <2, 4, 8>
   - <2, 5, 9>

3. Total number of triangles in the graph: [3]
