Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for triangles formed by connecting three vertices with edges. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

**Vertices with their connections:**
- 0: 5
- 1: 2, 4
- 2: 1, 5
- 4: 1
- 5: 0, 2, 8
- 7: 8
- 8: 5, 7

**Possible triangles:**
1. <0, 5, 2>
2. <1, 2, 5>
3. <1, 4, 2>
4. <0, 5, 8>
5. <2, 5, 8>
6. <7, 8, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
