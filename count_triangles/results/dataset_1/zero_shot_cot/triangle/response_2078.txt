Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.

Now, let's identify the unique triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle 3: <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle 4: <1, 5, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 6: <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle 7: <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle 8: <6, 8, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
