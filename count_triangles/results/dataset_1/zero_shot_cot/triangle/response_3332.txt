Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all the unique triangles formed by individual nodes connected by edges. We'll look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<2, 1, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
