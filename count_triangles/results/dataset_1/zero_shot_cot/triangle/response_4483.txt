Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will check each possible triangle based on the edges provided.

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
4. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
5. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
6. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
7. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
8. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
9. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
10. Triangle <8, 7, 9>

There are 10 triangles in total in the given graph. Therefore, the output is [10].
