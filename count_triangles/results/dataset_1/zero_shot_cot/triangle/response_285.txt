Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. For each node, find all pairs of neighbors and check if there is an edge between them. If there is an edge between two pairs of neighbors, then the three nodes form a triangle.

2. Count all unique triangles found.

After examining the provided graph, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
