Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we need to count the number of triangles present. Triangles occur when three nodes are connected to each other forming a closed loop.

Let's list out the triangles in the graph:
1. <1, 6, 7>
2. <1, 6, 9>
3. <1, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
