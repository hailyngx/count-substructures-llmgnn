Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique combinations of nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all interconnected with each other. Here are the steps to determine the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Identify the triangles based on the given edges:
   - Based on the provided edges, we can visually check which combinations of three nodes form triangles.

2. List the unique triangles found:
   - (0, 1, 8)
   - (0, 2, 7)
   - (0, 3, 9)
   - (1, 8, 9)
   - (2, 5, 7)
   - (3, 6, 9)

3. Count the total number of triangles:
   - [6] triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
