Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 5, 2)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 5, 9)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 9, 1)
   - Triangle 4: (5, 2, 6)
   - Triangle 5: (6, 3, 9)
   - Triangle 6: (2, 6, 3)
   - Triangle 7: (2, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 8: (2, 8, 6)
   - Triangle 9: (2, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 10: (8, 6, 9)

2. Count the total number of unique triangles: [10]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
