Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are pairwise connected by edges. Let's calculate the total number of triangles step-by-step.

1. **Identify Connected Triangles**:
   - Nodes connected in triangles: (0, 6, 4), (0, 6, 8), (6, 3, 9), (5, 4, 6), (5, 6, 8)

2. **Total Number of Triangles**:
   - There are [5] unique triangles found: <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 8>, <6, 3, 9>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
