Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the total number of triangles in the graph, we can identify triangles by finding nodes that are connected to each other in the form of a triangle. We will list out the triangles and then count them.

The triangles found in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
