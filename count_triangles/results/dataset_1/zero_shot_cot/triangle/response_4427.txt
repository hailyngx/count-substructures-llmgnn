Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can start by looking at each possible triangle formed by 3 nodes connected by edges.

Let's start by listing the triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 5, 1>
4. <0, 5, 6>
5. <1, 2, 3>
6. <1, 3, 4>
7. <1, 3, 5>
8. <1, 3, 6>
9. <1, 4, 9>
10. <1, 5, 6>
11. <1, 5, 7>
12. <1, 6, 7>
13. <3, 0, 9>
14. <3, 1, 9>
15. <4, 1, 9>
16. <6, 5, 7>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [16]
