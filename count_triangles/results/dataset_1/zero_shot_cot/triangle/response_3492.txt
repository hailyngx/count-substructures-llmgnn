Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <2, 4, 9>
5. <2, 6, 7>
6. <2, 3, 9>
7. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
