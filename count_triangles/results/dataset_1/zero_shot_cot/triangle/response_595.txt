Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Triangle with nodes 0, 1, 4: (0, 1), (1, 4), (4, 0)
2. Triangle with nodes 0, 3, 5: (0, 3), (3, 5), (5, 0)
3. Triangle with nodes 1, 4, 2: (1, 4), (4, 2), (2, 1)
4. Triangle with nodes 8, 9, 6: (8, 9), (9, 6), (6, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 2>, <8, 9, 6>.

So, the total number of triangles is [4].
