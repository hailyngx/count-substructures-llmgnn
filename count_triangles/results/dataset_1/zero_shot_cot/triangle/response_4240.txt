Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all triangles by looking at every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.
2. Count the number of unique triangles found.

By checking the provided edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangles with node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 7), (0, 2, 9)
2. Triangles with node 1: None
3. Triangles with node 2: None
4. Triangles with node 3: None
5. Triangles with node 4: None
6. Triangles with node 5: None
7. Triangles with node 6: None
8. Triangles with node 7: None
9. Triangles with node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 7>, and <0, 2, 9>.
