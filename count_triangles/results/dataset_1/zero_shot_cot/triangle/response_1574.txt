Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
By counting the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's identify them step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to 0: {1, 7, 8}
2. Nodes connected to 1: {0, 2, 6, 8}
3. Nodes connected to 2: {1, 4, 8}
4. Nodes connected to 3: {6}
5. Nodes connected to 4: {2}
6. Nodes connected to 5: {6, 9}
7. Nodes connected to 6: {1, 3, 5, 8}
8. Nodes connected to 7: {0}
9. Nodes connected to 8: {0, 1, 2, 6}
10. Nodes connected to 9: {5}

Now, let's identify the unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <6, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
