Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that form a triangle. 

Let's list all the triangles we can find in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <2, 3, 5>
4. <4, 5, 9>
5. <1, 3, 7>
6. <5, 8, 9>
7. <1, 6, 7>
8. <6, 8, 9>
9. <5, 6, 9>
10. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
