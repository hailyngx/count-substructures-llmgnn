Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for closed loops of length 3. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected with edges in such a way that they form a closed loop. Since we have a total of 10 nodes and 32 edges in the graph, we can calculate the number of triangles by examining all possible combinations of 3 nodes.

Let's start by counting the number of triangles:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <3, 5, 8>
7. <4, 6, 7>
8. <4, 6, 9>
9. <4, 7, 9>
10. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph, which can be represented inside brackets as [10].
