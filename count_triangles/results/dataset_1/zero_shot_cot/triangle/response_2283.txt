Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each unique set of three nodes that form a triangle. Let's try to find all the triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 4.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.

Now, let's list the triangles we can form based on the connections:

1. <1, 4, 6>
2. <2, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
