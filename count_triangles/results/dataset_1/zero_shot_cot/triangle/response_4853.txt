Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle involving node 0:
- (0, 6) and (0, 7) - nodes 0 and 6 are not directly connected.
- (0, 6) and (0, 7) - nodes 0 and 7 are directly connected.
- (6, 0) and (7, 0) - nodes 6 and 7 are not directly connected.
Therefore, there are no triangles involving node 0.

2. Triangle involving node 1:
- (1, 2) and (1, 3) - nodes 1 and 2 are directly connected.
- (1, 2) and (2, 8) - nodes 1, 2, and 8 form a triangle <1, 2, 8>.
- (1, 3) and (3, 1) - nodes 1 and 3 are directly connected.
Therefore, there is one triangle involving node 1, which is <1, 2, 8>.

3. Triangle involving node 2:
- (2, 1) and (1, 3) - nodes 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle <1, 2, 3>.
- (2, 1) and (2, 8) - nodes 1, 2, and 8 form a triangle <1, 2, 8>.
Therefore, there are two triangles involving node 2, which are <1, 2, 3> and <1, 2, 8>.

4. Triangle involving node 3:
- (3, 1) and (1, 2) - nodes 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle <1, 2, 3>.
- (3, 1) and (3, 7) - nodes 1, 3, and 7 form a triangle <1, 3, 7>.
- (3, 7) and (7, 0) - nodes 0, 3, and 7 form a triangle <0, 3, 7>.
- (3, 8) and (8, 2) - nodes 2, 3, and 8 form a triangle <2, 3, 8>.
Therefore, there are four triangles involving node 3, which are <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, and <2, 3, 8>.

5. Triangle involving node 4:
- (4, 8) and (8, 5) - nodes 4 and 5 are not directly connected.
Therefore, there are no triangles involving node 4.

6. Triangle involving node 5:
- (8, 5) and (5, 9) - nodes 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
Therefore, there are no triangles involving node 5.

7. Triangle involving node 6:
- (0, 6) and (6, 0) - nodes 0 and 6 are not directly connected.
Therefore, there are no triangles involving node 6.

8. Triangle involving node 7:
- (0, 7) and (7, 3) - nodes 0, 3, and 7 form a triangle <0, 3, 7>.
- (1, 7) and (7, 3) - nodes 1, 3, and 7 form a triangle <1, 3, 7>.
Therefore, there are two triangles involving node 7, which are <0, 3, 7> and <1, 3, 7>.

9. Triangle involving node 8:
- (2, 8) and (8, 3) - nodes 2, 3, and 8 form a triangle <2, 3, 8>.
- (3, 8) and (8, 4) - nodes 3 and 4 are not directly connected.
- (5, 8) and (8, 9) - nodes 5, 8, and 9 form a triangle <5, 8, 9>.
Therefore, there are two triangles involving node 8, which are <2, 3, 8> and <5, 8, 9>.

10. Triangle involving node 9:
- (5, 9) and (9, 8) - nodes 5, 8, and 9 form a triangle <5, 8, 9>.
Therefore, there is one triangle involving node 9, which is <5, 8, 9>.

Combining all the unique triangles found, we have:
[<1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <5, 8, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
