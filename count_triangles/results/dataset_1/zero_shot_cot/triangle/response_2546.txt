Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node in the graph.

Node 0: degree = 3
Node 1: degree = 3
Node 2: degree = 3
Node 3: degree = 4
Node 4: degree = 5
Node 5: degree = 2
Node 6: degree = 3
Node 7: degree = 5
Node 8: degree = 1
Node 9: degree = 3

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles in the graph.

To count the number of triangles, we need to find all triplets of nodes that are mutually adjacent to each other.

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <1, 3, 4>
5. <1, 3, 7>
6. <1, 4, 7>
7. <2, 3, 7>
8. <2, 3, 9>
9. <3, 4, 7>
10. <3, 4, 9>
11. <4, 6, 7>
12. <5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [12]
