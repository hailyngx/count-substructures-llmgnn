Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by three connected vertices. Let's start by identifying the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <1, 7, 8>

There are a total of 5 unique triangles present in the graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
