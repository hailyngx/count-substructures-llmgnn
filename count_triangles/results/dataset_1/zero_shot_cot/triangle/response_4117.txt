Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles by checking for nodes that are connected forming a closed loop of three edges.

Let's identify the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <3, 1, 9>
4. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
5. Triangle <3, 8, 9>
6. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
7. Triangle <5, 6, 2>
8. Triangle <3, 7, 9>
9. Triangle <2, 6, 5>
10. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

So, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
The total number of triangles is [10].
