Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's first go through the given edges to identify the triangles:

- Triangle 1: (2, 3, 5)
- Triangle 2: (2, 7, 8)
- Triangle 3: (1, 9, 2)

Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles:
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <1, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
