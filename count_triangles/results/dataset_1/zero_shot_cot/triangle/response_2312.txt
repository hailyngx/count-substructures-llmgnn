Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:
1. Look for triangles involving node 0:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 6, 2)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 8, 1)
   - Triangle 4: (0, 9, 3)
   
2. Look for triangles involving node 1:
   - No triangles with node 1 as all its connections are already part of the triangles found in step 1.
   
3. Look for triangles involving node 2:
   - No triangles involving node 2.

4. Look for triangles involving node 3:
   - No triangles with node 3 as all its connections are already part of the triangles found in step 1.
   
5. Look for triangles involving node 4:
   - No new triangles with node 4 as all its connections are already part of the triangles found in step 1.
   
6. Look for triangles involving node 5:
   - No new triangles with node 5 as all its connections are already part of the triangles found in step 1.
   
7. Look for triangles involving node 6:
   - No new triangles with node 6 as all its connections are already part of the triangles found in step 1.
   
8. Look for triangles involving node 8:
   - No new triangles with node 8 as all its connections are already part of the triangles found in step 1.
   
9. Look for triangles involving node 9:
   - No new triangles with node 9 as all its connections are already part of the triangles found in step 1.
  
Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles found: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 2>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 9, 3>
