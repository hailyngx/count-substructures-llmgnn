Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Check for triangles involving node 0:
- Triangles involving node 0 are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>

Step 2: Check for triangles involving node 1:
- No new triangles are formed involving node 1.

Step 3: Check for triangles involving node 2:
- Triangles involving node 2 are: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 4>

Step 4: Check for triangles involving node 3:
- No new triangles are formed involving node 3.

Step 5: Check for triangles involving node 4:
- No new triangles are formed involving node 4.

Step 6: Check for triangles involving node 7:
- No new triangles are formed involving node 7.

Step 7: Check for triangles involving node 8:
- No new triangles are formed involving node 8.

Step 8: Check for triangles involving node 9:
- No new triangles are formed involving node 9.

Total number of triangles: [2]
