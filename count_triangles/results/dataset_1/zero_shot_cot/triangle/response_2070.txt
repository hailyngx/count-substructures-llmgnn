Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Check each possible triangle formed by 3 nodes:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 3)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 3, 9)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 9, 4)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 0, 6)
   - Triangle 5: (3, 2, 5)
   - Triangle 6: (3, 5, 4)
   - Triangle 7: (3, 6, 9)
   - Triangle 8: (4, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 9: (4, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 10: (4, 9, 6)
   - Triangle 11: (6, 7, 9)
   - Triangle 12: (7, 8, 9)

2. Now, we can see that there are 12 triangles in total. Let's list the unique triangles found:
   - <0, 1, 3>
   - <0, 3, 9>
   - <0, 9, 4>
   - <1, 0, 6>
   - <3, 2, 5>
   - <3, 5, 4>
   - <3, 6, 9>
   - <4, 6, 7>
   - <4, 7, 8>
   - <4, 9, 6>
   - <6, 7, 9>
   - <7, 8, 9>

3. Finally, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
