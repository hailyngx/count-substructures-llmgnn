Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph based on the given edges:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 7, 8>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 6>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles present in the graph:
Total number of triangles = 5

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
