Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in a graph, we need to identify sets of three vertices that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step to find the triangles in this graph.

1. Starting with vertex 0: Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1 and 4.

2. Vertex 1: Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

3. Vertex 2: Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1, 4, and 8.

4. Vertex 3: Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 5.

5. Vertex 4: Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 0, 2, 5, 7, and 8.

6. Vertex 5: Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1, 3, and 4.

7. Vertex 6: Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 1 and 7.

8. Vertex 7: Vertex 7 is connected to vertices 1, 4, 6, and 9.

9. Vertex 8: Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 2 and 4.

10. Vertex 9: Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 1 and 7.

Based on the connections above, we have found the following triangles in the graph:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
