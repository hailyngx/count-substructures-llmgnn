Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9, forming a triangle <3, 6, 8>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 9, but they do not form a triangle since there is no edge between nodes 5 and 9 directly.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9, forming a triangle <5, 7, 9>.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 9, but they do not form a triangle since there is no edge between nodes 3 and 9 directly.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9, forming a triangle <5, 7, 9>.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9, forming a triangle <3, 7, 9>.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, and 8, forming triangles <9, 0, 5>, <9, 6, 5>, <9, 7, 5>, <9, 8, 5>, and <9, 7, 8>.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
