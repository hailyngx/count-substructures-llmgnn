Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for combinations of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

In this graph, the triangles are as follows:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
