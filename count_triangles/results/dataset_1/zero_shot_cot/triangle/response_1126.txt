Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
2. Triangle <7, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
