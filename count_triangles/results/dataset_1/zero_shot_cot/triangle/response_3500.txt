Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 5>.
