Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

First, we need to identify the triangles by checking for nodes that form closed loops of length 3.

The triangles are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <1, 5, 7>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <2, 4, 5>
7. <4, 5, 7>
8. <4, 7, 8>
9. <5, 6, 7>
10. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
