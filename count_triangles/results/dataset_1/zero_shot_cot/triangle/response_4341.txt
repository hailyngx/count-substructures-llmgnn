Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: (2, 4, 5)
- Triangle 2: (5, 7, 8)

There are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
