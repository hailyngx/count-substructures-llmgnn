Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected by edges. Let's go step-by-step to find all the triangles:

1. For node 0: Triangles involving node 0 can be found using its connections to nodes 2, 4, 6. However, there are no triangles involving node 0 in this graph.

2. For node 1: Triangles involving node 1 can be found using its connections to nodes 2, 3, 6, 7. However, there are no triangles involving node 1 in this graph.

3. For node 2: Triangles involving node 2 can be found using its connections to nodes 0, 1, 5, 9. There is one triangle involving node 2: triangle <0, 1, 2>.

4. For node 3: Triangles involving node 3 can be found using its connections to nodes 1, 5, 9. However, there are no triangles involving node 3 in this graph.

5. For node 4: Triangles involving node 4 can be found using its connections to nodes 0, 5. However, there are no triangles involving node 4 in this graph.

6. For node 5: Triangles involving node 5 can be found using its connections to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. There is one triangle involving node 5: triangle <2, 3, 5>.

7. For node 6: Triangles involving node 6 can be found using its connections to nodes 0, 1, 5. However, there are no triangles involving node 6 in this graph.

8. For node 7: Triangles involving node 7 can be found using its connections to node 1 and 5. However, there are no triangles involving node 7 in this graph.

9. For node 8: Triangles involving node 8 can be found using its connection to node 9. However, there are no triangles involving node 8 in this graph.

10. For node 9: Triangles involving node 9 can be found using its connections to nodes 2, 3, 8. However, there are no triangles involving node 9 in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2> and <2, 3, 5>.
