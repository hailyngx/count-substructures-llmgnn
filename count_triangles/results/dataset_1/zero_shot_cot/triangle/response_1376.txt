Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in a graph, we will look for every set of three nodes that are fully connected by edges.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 2, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
