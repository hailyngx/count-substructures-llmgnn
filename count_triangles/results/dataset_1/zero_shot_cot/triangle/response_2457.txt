Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. We have 10 nodes, and from the given information, we can see that there are 28 edges between these nodes.

2. To find out the total number of triangles, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

3. Let's list down the triangles that we can form:

   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 1, 6>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 2, 6>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 2, 8>
   - Triangle 5: <4, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 6: <6, 3, 7>
   - Triangle 7: <6, 6, 8>
   - Triangle 8: <6, 6, 9>

4. Counting all the unique triangles, we found a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
