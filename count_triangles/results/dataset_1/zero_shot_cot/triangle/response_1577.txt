Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 5, 6>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 6, 9>
4. Triangle 4: <1, 2, 9>
5. Triangle 5: <4, 5, 9>
6. Triangle 6: <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
