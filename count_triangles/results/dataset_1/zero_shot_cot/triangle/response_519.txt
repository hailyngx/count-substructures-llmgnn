Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles in the given graph:

1. (0, 2, 6)
2. (0, 2, 8)
3. (0, 2, 3)
4. (0, 3, 6)
5. (0, 6, 8)
6. (0, 6, 7)
7. (0, 8, 9)
8. (1, 5, 4)
9. (4, 5, 9)
10. (6, 7, 9)
11. (7, 8, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
