Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 4. 

The unique triangles are: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, and <2, 4, 9>. Ultimately, we can confirm that there are 4 triangles in total as described above.
