Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node pairs connected by an edge:
   - Node 0: 3, 4, 8
     - (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 8), (8, 4)
   - Node 1: 2, 5
     - (2, 1), (5, 1)
   - Node 2: 1, 7
     - (1, 2), (7, 2)
   - Node 3: 0, 4
     - (0, 3), (4, 0), (4, 3)
   - Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 9
     - (0, 4), (3, 0), (6, 4), (9, 4), (9, 6)
   - Node 5: 1, 7
     - (1, 5), (7, 5)
   - Node 6: 4, 9
     - (4, 6), (9, 6)
   - Node 7: 2, 5
     - (2, 7), (5, 7)

2. Identify triangles formed by node connections:
   - Triangles:
     - <0, 3, 4>
     - <1, 2, 7>
     - <4, 6, 9>

3. Total number of triangles: [3]
