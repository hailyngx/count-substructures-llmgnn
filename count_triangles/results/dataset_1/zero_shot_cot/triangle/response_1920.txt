Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for cycles of length 3 (triangles). Let's analyze the graph and count the number of triangles step-by-step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 3.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 3.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 2.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 2.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 1.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
4. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
5. Triangle <0, 6, 2>
6. Triangle <1, 2, 6>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
