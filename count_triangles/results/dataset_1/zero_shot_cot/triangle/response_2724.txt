Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of adjacency lists based on the provided edges:

Node 0: 2
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 0, 1
Node 3: 5, 7, 8
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 3, 8, 9
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 3, 5
Node 9: 4, 5

To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list them:

1. <2, 0, 1>
2. <3, 5, 8>
3. <4, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
