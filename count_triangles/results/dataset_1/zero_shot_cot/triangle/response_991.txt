Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph using adjacency list:
```
0: 1, 6, 8, 9
1: 0
2: 3, 7
3: 2, 5, 7, 8
4: 7, 9
5: 3, 7, 9
6: 0
7: 2, 3, 4, 5
8: 0, 3, 9
9: 0, 4, 5, 8
```

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
4. Triangle <3, 7, 5>
5. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <3, 8, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
8. Triangle <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
