Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle.
2. Count the total number of triangles formed.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 6>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 9, 6>
<5, 9, 7>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
