Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9.

Now, let's look for the triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 2, 7 form a triangle.
- Triangle 2: Nodes 0, 4, 7 form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7> and <0, 4, 7>.
