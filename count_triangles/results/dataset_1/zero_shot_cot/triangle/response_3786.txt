Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 32 edges given in the graph. To count the number of triangles:

1. Since a triangle consists of 3 nodes connected to each other, we need to find all unique triangles in the graph.
2. Start checking each combination of 3 nodes to see if they form a triangle.

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
