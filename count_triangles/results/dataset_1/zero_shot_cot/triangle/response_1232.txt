Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are each connected to the other two nodes in the set. Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Node pairs: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 9), (2, 4), (3, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8)
   
2. Triangles:
   - <0, 1, 9>
   - <0, 3, 7>
   - <0, 6, 8>
   - <0, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
