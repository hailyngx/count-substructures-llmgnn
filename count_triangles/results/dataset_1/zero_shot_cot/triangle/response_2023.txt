Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected with edges to form triangles. Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Node pairs that form edges in the graph:
- (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 8), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9)

2. Identify the triangles (sets of three interconnected nodes):
- <0, 1, 2>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <6, 7, 9>

3. Count the total number of triangles from the identified sets:
- Total number of triangles: [7]
