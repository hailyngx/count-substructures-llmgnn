Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph.

Triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <1, 2, 9>
5. <3, 4, 8>
6. <8, 9, 3>
7. <8, 9, 4>

Count of triangles: [7]
