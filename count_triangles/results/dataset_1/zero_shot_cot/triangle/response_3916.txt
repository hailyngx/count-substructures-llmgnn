Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of 3 nodes that are interconnected. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4> is formed by nodes 0, 2, and 4.
2. Triangle <0, 4, 7> is formed by nodes 0, 4, and 7.
3. Triangle <0, 6, 7> is formed by nodes 0, 6, and 7.
4. Triangle <0, 7, 8> is formed by nodes 0, 7, and 8.
5. Triangle <3, 5, 6> is formed by nodes 3, 5, and 6.
6. Triangle <3, 7, 8> is formed by nodes 3, 7, and 8.
7. Triangle <4, 7, 9> is formed by nodes 4, 7, and 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
