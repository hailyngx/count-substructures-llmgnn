Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in this graph:

- Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 2, 4 <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: Nodes 1, 5, 9 <1, 5, 9>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
