Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine all possible triangles formed by the existing edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected to each other.

The nodes in the graph are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's start by listing the unique triangles we can find in this graph:

1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <1, 5, 6>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <1, 7, 6>
6. <2, 5, 1>
7. <2, 5, 8>
8. <2, 6, 1>
9. <2, 8, 5>
10. <5, 1, 2>
11. <5, 2, 8>
12. <6, 1, 2>
13. <6, 1, 7>
14. <6, 2, 1>
15. <6, 7, 1>
16. <7, 1, 6>
17. <7, 6, 1>
18. <8, 2, 5>
19. <8, 5, 2>
20. <8, 7, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [20] triangles in the given graph.
