Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected by edges. Let's count the total number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Look at each node and its connections:
    - Node 0: Connected to node 6.
        - Triangle <0, 6, x> not formed (x is any other node).
    - Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7.
        - Possible triangles: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 7>
    - Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 6.
        - Possible triangle: <1, 2, 3>
    - Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, 8.
        - Possible triangles: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 8>
    - Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 7.
        - Triangle <4, 5, 7> not formed (7 is missing connection to 4).
    - Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 8.
        - Possible triangle: <1, 5, 7>
    - Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 9.
        - Triangle <0, 2, 6> not formed (6 is missing connection to 0).
    - Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 8.
        - Possible triangle: <1, 5, 7>
    - Node 8: Connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, 9.
        - Triangle <3, 5, 8> not formed (8 is missing connection to 5).
    - Node 9: Connected to nodes 6, 8.
        - Triangle <6, 8, 9> not formed (9 is missing connection to 6).

2. Counting the total number of triangles:
    - There are 2 unique triangles: <1, 2, 3> and <1, 5, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
