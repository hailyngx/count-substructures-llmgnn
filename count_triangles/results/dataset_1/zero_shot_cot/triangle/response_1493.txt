Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the steps to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

Step 1: Count the number of triangles formed by the edges in the graph.

Calculating the triangles formed by each set of three nodes:

1. Triangles with node 0: (0, 4, 6), (0, 6, 7), (0, 7, 9) - 3 triangles.
2. Triangles with node 1: No triangles.
3. Triangles with node 2: (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 7) - 2 triangles.
4. Triangles with node 3: (3, 1, 9) - 1 triangle.
5. Triangles with node 4: No triangles.
6. Triangles with node 5: No triangles.
7. Triangles with node 6: (6, 0, 4), (6, 0, 9), (6, 3, 7), (6, 4, 9), (6, 7, 9) - 5 triangles.
8. Triangles with node 7: (7, 0, 2), (7, 0, 3), (7, 2, 3), (7, 3, 6) - 4 triangles.
9. Triangles with node 8: No triangles.
10. Triangles with node 9: (9, 1, 3), (9, 3, 4), (9, 3, 6) - 3 triangles.

Step 2: Total number of triangles = 3 (from node 0) + 2 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 5 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 7) + 3 (from node 9) = 18 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [18]. 

The triangles found in the graph are: <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 1, 3>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 1, 9>, <6, 0, 4>, <6, 0, 9>, <6, 3, 7>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 0, 2>, <7, 0, 3>, <7, 2, 3>, <7, 3, 6>, <9, 1, 3>, <9, 3, 4>, <9, 3, 6>.
