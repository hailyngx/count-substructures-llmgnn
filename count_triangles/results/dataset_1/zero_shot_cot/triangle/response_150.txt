Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each unique set of three nodes that are pairwise connected. Let's list out the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <0, 2, 8>
4. <1, 2, 9>
5. <1, 3, 9>
6. <2, 3, 5>
7. <2, 4, 8>
8. <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
