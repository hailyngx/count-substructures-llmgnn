Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's list all the triangles we can find in this graph:

1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <0, 3, 2>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <0, 3, 6>
5. <2, 3, 5>
6. <2, 3, 6>
7. <2, 3, 7>
8. <2, 5, 6>
9. <2, 6, 7>
10. <3, 5, 6>
11. <3, 6, 7>
12. <3, 6, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles inside brackets []:
