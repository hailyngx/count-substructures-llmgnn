Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all the sets of three nodes that are mutually connected. In other words, we will look for all the triangles in the graph.

The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [6]
