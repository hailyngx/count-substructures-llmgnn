Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, let's first identify all possible triangles formed by the given edges:

Possible Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <1, 4, 7>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <2, 4, 7>
7. <2, 4, 8>
8. <3, 4, 8>
9. <3, 5, 6>
10. <3, 7, 6>
11. <4, 7, 6>

Count: [11]
