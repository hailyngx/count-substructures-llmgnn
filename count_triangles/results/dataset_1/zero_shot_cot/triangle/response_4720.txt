Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for the set of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a triangle. 

After analyzing the provided edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:

1. <1, 7, 4>
2. <1, 7, 2>
3. <1, 8, 2>
4. <3, 1, 7>
5. <3, 1, 4>
6. <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
