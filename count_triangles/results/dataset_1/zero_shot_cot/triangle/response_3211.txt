Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].  
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 0, 1>.
