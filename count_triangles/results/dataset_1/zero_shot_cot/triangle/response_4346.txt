Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's follow a step-by-step process:

1. We will list all the triangles present in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 4, 3>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 4, 6>
   - Triangle 3: <3, 4, 6>

2. Now, we will output the total number of triangles found:
   Total number of triangles: [3]
