Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
This graph contains a total of 7 triangles. The unique triangles found in the graph are:

<0, 7, 8>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<7, 8, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
