Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each triangle formed by three connected nodes.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <2, 7, 9>
6. <4, 0, 8>
7. <4, 0, 9>
8. <4, 3, 7>
9. <4, 7, 5>
10. <5, 6, 7>
11. <6, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
