Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will then count each unique triangle we find.

After examining the given edges, here are some of the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <2, 3, 4>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <3, 4, 7>
7. <3, 5, 6>
8. <4, 5, 0>
9. <4, 5, 3>
10. <7, 6, 3>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.
