Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 has connections with nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 4 has connections with nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 5 has connections with nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 6 has a connection with node 2.
- Node 7 has connections with nodes 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 has a connection with node 7.
- Node 9 has connections with nodes 0, 2, and 7.

Let's now find the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 2>
4. Triangle <0, 9, 2>
5. Triangle <2, 5, 0>
6. Triangle <2, 9, 0>
7. Triangle <5, 0, 2>
8. Triangle <9, 0, 2>
9. Triangle <2, 9, 7>
10. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
11. Triangle <7, 4, 3>
12. Triangle <7, 4, 9>

So, there are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
