Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the given edges, identify the triangles formed by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular manner:
   - Triangle 1: Nodes (0, 4, 8)
   - Triangle 2: Nodes (0, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 3: Nodes (0, 5, 2)
   - Triangle 4: Nodes (0, 6, 9)
   - Triangle 5: Nodes (4, 3, 5)
   - Triangle 6: Nodes (8, 9, 6)

2. Count the total number of triangles and also list them uniquely:
   Total number of triangles: [6]
   Unique triangles: <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 6, 9>, <4, 3, 5>, <8, 9, 6>
