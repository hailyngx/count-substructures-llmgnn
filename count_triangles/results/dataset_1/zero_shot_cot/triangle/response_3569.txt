Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Nodes 0, 1, and 2 form a triangle.
2. Nodes 0, 1, and 9 form a triangle.
3. Nodes 1, 5, and 7 form a triangle.
4. Nodes 5, 6, and 7 form a triangle.
5. Nodes 5, 7, and 9 form a triangle.

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
