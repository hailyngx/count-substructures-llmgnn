Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Analyzing the given graph, we can determine the triangles present:

1. Possible triangles involving node 0:  
   - <0, 1, 5>  
   - <0, 1, 6>  
   - <0, 1, 8>  
   - <0, 1, 9>  
   - <0, 5, 6>  
   - <0, 5, 8>  
   - <0, 6, 8>  
   - <0, 6, 9>  

2. Possible triangles involving node 1:  
   - <1, 2, 6>  
   - <1, 2, 7>  
   - <1, 2, 8>  

3. Possible triangles involving node 2:  
   - <2, 6, 7>  
   - <2, 6, 8>  
   - <2, 7, 8>  

4. Possible triangles involving node 3:  
   - No triangles as there are no edges connecting nodes 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

5. Possible triangles involving node 4:  
   - No triangles as there are no edges connecting nodes 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

6. Possible triangles involving node 5:  
   - No triangles as there are no triangles involving node 5 due to the nature of the existing edges.

7. Possible triangles involving node 6:  
   - No new triangles as all the relevant combinations have been covered previously.

8. Possible triangles involving node 7:  
   - No new triangles as all the relevant combinations have been covered previously.

9. Possible triangles involving node 8:  
   - No new triangles as all the relevant combinations have been covered previously.

10. Possible triangles involving node 9:  
   - No new triangles as all the relevant combinations have been covered previously.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
