Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph.

1. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
5. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 6, 9>

Now, counting the total number of triangles in the given graph:
[6]
