Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles by looking at the connectivity between nodes.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <4, 7, 9>

There are no other triangles in the graph based on the given edges.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
