Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes with edges. Here are the steps to count the triangles:

1. Identify all possible triangles based on the given edges.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's go through each step:

1. Possible triangles based on the given edges:
   - (0, 4, 7)
   - (1, 2, 8)
   - (1, 3, 5)
   - (1, 8, 9)
   - (2, 1, 8)
   - (3, 1, 5)
   - (5, 7, 8)
   - (8, 1, 9)

2. Total number of unique triangles: 8

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 1, 8>, <3, 1, 5>, <5, 7, 8>, and <8, 1, 9>.
