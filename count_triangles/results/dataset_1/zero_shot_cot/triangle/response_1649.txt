Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. From the given edges, we can identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 4, 6)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 8, 5)
   - Triangle 4: (1, 9, 6)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 6, 4)
   - Triangle 6: (3, 5, 0)
   - Triangle 7: (6, 8, 5)
   - Triangle 8: (6, 9, 1)

Count of triangles: [8]
