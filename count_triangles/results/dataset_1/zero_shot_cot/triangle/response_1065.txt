Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Triangle <1, 3, 8>
- Triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle <3, 6, 8>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>
- Triangle <8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
