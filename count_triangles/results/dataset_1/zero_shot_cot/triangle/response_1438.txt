Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. A triangle is formed when three nodes form a cycle of length 3.

Let's examine the graph to find all the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 3>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
