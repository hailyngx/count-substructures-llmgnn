Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, the number of triangles can be found as follows:

Step 1: Identify all possible triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to form a triangle.
- For triangle formation, three nodes need to be connected to each other. Let's consider all possible combinations of 3 nodes out of the given 10 nodes.

(0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 8), (0, 3, 2), (0, 3, 8), (1, 6, 8), (2, 3, 5), (2, 5, 7), (4, 5, 7), (4, 5, 9), (5, 7, 9)

Step 2: Counting the number of unique triangles:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 1, 8>
4. <0, 3, 2>
5. <0, 3, 8>
6. <1, 6, 8>
7. <2, 3, 5>
8. <2, 5, 7>
9. <4, 5, 7>
10. <4, 5, 9>
11. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
