Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by the connected nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. We will look for triangles formed by 3 nodes connected by edges.
2. We will mention each unique triangle found.
3. Finally, we will count the total number of triangles.

Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
