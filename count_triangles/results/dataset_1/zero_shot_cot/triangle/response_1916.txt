Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7> and <3, 4, 9>.
