Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's analyze the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Now, let's determine the triangles using the given connections:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
