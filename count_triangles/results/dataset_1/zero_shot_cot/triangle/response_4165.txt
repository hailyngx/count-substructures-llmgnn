Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the given graph to better understand it:
```
        1 --- 6
        |     |
        3 --- 9 --- 8 --- 7
         \   / |     |
           2  4 --- 0
```

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes that are fully connected to each other. We will now identify the triangles one by one:
1. Triangle: <3, 4, 9>
2. Triangle: <8, 9, 4>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
