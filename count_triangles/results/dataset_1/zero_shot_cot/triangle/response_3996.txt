Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by examining each possible triangle formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed whenever there are edges connecting all three nodes. 
Let's list the unique triangles found:

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 0>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 1>
<8, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
