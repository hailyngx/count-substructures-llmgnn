Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a closed triangle. Let's go step by step:

First, identify the triangles based on the given edges:

1. Triangle: <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle: <1, 3, 4>
3. Triangle: <1, 6, 9>
4. Triangle: <2, 3, 7>
5. Triangle: <2, 4, 7>

Now, count the total number of triangles inside brackets []: [5]
