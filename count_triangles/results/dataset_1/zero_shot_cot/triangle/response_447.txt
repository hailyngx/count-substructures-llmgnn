Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 2.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.

Now, let's list down the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <5, 6, 8>

Counting the unique triangles, we have a total of [5] triangles in the graph.
