Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first determine the total number of triangles in the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Check each node's neighbors to find common neighbors.
- Node 0: Neighbors (1, 8, 9)
- Node 1: Neighbors (0, 3, 7, 9)
- Node 2: Neighbors (4, 5, 9)
- Node 3: Neighbors (1, 7, 9)
- Node 4: Neighbors (2, 7)
- Node 5: Neighbors (2, 8, 9)
- Node 6: Neighbors (9)
- Node 7: Neighbors (1, 3, 4)
- Node 8: Neighbors (0, 5)
- Node 9: Neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6)

Step 2: Identify triangles based on common neighbors.
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 9> (Common neighbor: 9)
- Triangle 2: <2, 5, 9> (Common neighbor: 9)
- Triangle 3: <1, 3, 7> (Common neighbor: 1, 7)
- Triangle 4: <1, 3, 9> (Common neighbor: 1, 3, 9)

Step 3: Calculate the total number of triangles.
- Total number of triangles: 4

Therefore, the total number of triangles present in the given graph is [4].
