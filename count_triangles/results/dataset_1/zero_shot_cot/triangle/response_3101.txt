Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here is how we can find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Look at each node and its neighbors to find triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 3, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 7, 8>
   - Triangle 3: <1, 2, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 8, 9>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 6: <3, 6, 8>
   - Triangle 7: <3, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 8: <4, 0, 3>
   - Triangle 9: <7, 8, 9>

2. Count the total number of triangles: [9]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 9.
