Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we will calculate the total number of triangles and list them out accordingly:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 8.

Now, we will count the number of triangles formed:

- Triangle 1: <2, 8, 9>
- Triangle 2: <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle 3: <2, 5, 4>
- Triangle 4: <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 6: <2, 7, 4>
- Triangle 7: <3, 9, 6>
- Triangle 8: <3, 6, 0>
- Triangle 9: <3, 1, 4>
- Triangle 10: <4, 5, 8>
- Triangle 11: <4, 5, 2>
- Triangle 12: <4, 7, 2>
- Triangle 13: <5, 8, 2>
- Triangle 14: <5, 8, 9>
- Triangle 15: <6, 0, 3>
- Triangle 16: <6, 9, 3>
- Triangle 17: <8, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
