Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected with edges. Let's start by looking at the possible triangles:

1. Triangle involving nodes: 0, 2, 5
2. Triangle involving nodes: 0, 2, 8
3. Triangle involving nodes: 1, 2, 6
4. Triangle involving nodes: 2, 7, 8
5. Triangle involving nodes: 2, 3, 4
6. Triangle involving nodes: 3, 8, 9
7. Triangle involving nodes: 3, 4, 9

So, there are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: **[7]**.
