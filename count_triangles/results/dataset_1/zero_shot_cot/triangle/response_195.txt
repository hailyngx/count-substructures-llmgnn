Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Nodes 6, 4, and 7 form a triangle.
2. Nodes 2, 4, and 7 form a triangle.
3. Nodes 6, 7, and 4 form a triangle.
4. Nodes 6, 4, and 2 form a triangle.
5. Nodes 6, 2, and 7 form a triangle.

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. 

The answer is: [5]
