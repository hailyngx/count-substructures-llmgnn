Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
