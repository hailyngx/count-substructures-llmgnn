Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:

- First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
  - Triangle 1: (1, 3, 7)
  - Triangle 2: (2, 3, 5)
  - Triangle 3: (2, 3, 6)
  - Triangle 4: (2, 5, 6)
  - Triangle 5: (3, 6, 9)
  - Triangle 6: (4, 7, 9)

- Now, let's count the total number of triangles in the graph:
  - Total number of triangles = 6

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>.
