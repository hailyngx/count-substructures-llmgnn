Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8.

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 3: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle 4: <0, 7, 8>
- Triangle 5: <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle 6: <1, 3, 9>
- Triangle 7: <4, 9, 8>

Total number of triangles: [7]
