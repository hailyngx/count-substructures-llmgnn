Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes with their connections:
   - Node 0 connects with nodes 3 and 4.
   - Node 1 connects with nodes 2, 4, and 7.
   - Node 2 connects with nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
   - Node 3 connects with nodes 0, 5, and 9.
   - Node 4 connects with nodes 0, 1.
   - Node 5 connects with nodes 3 and 8.
   - Node 6 connects with nodes 2 and 9.
   - Node 7 connects with nodes 1 and 2.
   - Node 8 connects with nodes 2 and 5.
   - Node 9 connects with nodes 3 and 6.

2. To form a triangle, we need 3 nodes connected to each other. We can identify triangles by examining nodes that have mutual connections.

3. Triangles in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: <1, 4, 7>
   - Triangle 2: <2, 7, 1>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
