Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find and count the triangles:

1. **List all the triangles:**
   - Triangle 1: (1, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 6, 9)
   
2. **Count the total number of triangles:**
   - The total number of triangles in this graph is **2**.

Therefore, the output should be:
[2]
