Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for closed loops of length 3, which form triangles. 

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 8, 7>
2. <1, 5, 3>
3. <2, 9, 4>
4. <4, 8, 9>
5. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
