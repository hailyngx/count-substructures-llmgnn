Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:
- To form a triangle, we need 3 nodes that are all connected to each other.
- Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle with nodes 0, 1, 5. <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle with nodes 0, 2, 8. <0, 2, 8>
3. Triangle with nodes 0, 3, 7. <0, 3, 7>
4. Triangle with nodes 0, 5, 7. <0, 5, 7>
5. Triangle with nodes 1, 5, 7. <1, 5, 7>
6. Triangle with nodes 2, 5, 6. <2, 5, 6>
7. Triangle with nodes 2, 6, 9. <2, 6, 9>
8. Triangle with nodes 3, 7, 8. <3, 7, 8>
9. Triangle with nodes 6, 7, 9. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
