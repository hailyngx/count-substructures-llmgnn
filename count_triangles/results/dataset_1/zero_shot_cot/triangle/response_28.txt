Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 8, 3>, <5, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 5>, <8, 6, 7>.
