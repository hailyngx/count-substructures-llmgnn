Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list for easier visualization:
Node 0: [7, 8, 9]
Node 1: [3, 4, 5, 8]
Node 2: [3, 4, 6]
Node 3: [1, 2, 4]
Node 4: [1, 2, 3]
Node 5: [1, 6, 7]
Node 6: [2, 5]
Node 7: [0, 5, 9]
Node 8: [0, 1]
Node 9: [0, 7]

Now, let's count the number of triangles by looking for nodes that form triangles:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 2>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [4]
