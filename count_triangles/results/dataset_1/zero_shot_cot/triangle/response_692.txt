Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, and 8.
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes 2, 4, 5 (<2, 4, 5>)
- Triangle 2: Nodes 2, 5, 7 (<2, 5, 7>)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
