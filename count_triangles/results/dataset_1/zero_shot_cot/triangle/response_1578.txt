Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 7.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 6>
<1, 7, 2>
<1, 8, 6>
<1, 8, 5>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 8> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
