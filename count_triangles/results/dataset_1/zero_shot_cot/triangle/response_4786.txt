Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can find the total number of triangles by calculating the number of unique triangles.

Looking at the graph, we can identify the following unique triangles:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 7, 1>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
