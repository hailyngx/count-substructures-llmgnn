Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles based on the edges provided.

Let's identify the triangles formed by the edges:
1. Triangle: <0, 7, 5>
2. Triangle: <0, 7, 1>
3. Triangle: <0, 7, 8>
4. Triangle: <0, 6, 2>
5. Triangle: <2, 7, 5>
6. Triangle: <2, 7, 1>
7. Triangle: <6, 9, 7>
8. Triangle: <6, 3, 2>

Therefore, there are a total of 8 unique triangles in the given graph. Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
