Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all pairwise connected by an edge. Let's start by listing out the triangles we find:

1. <1, 4, 7>
2. <1, 4, 2>
3. <1, 4, 3>
4. <1, 6, 2>
5. <1, 6, 3>
6. <1, 8, 3>
7. <2, 5, 3>
8. <2, 5, 4>
9. <2, 9, 7>
10. <3, 0, 5>
11. <3, 4, 5>
12. <3, 8, 1>
13. <3, 8, 4>
14. <4, 5, 7>
15. <4, 5, 2>
16. <4, 7, 9>
17. <5, 2, 6>
18. <5, 3, 8>
19. <7, 9, 2>

There are a total of 19 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [19].
