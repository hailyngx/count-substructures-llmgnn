Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.

Let's count the triangles now:
- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 6)
- Triangle 2: (0, 2, 6)
- Triangle 3: (0, 4, 6)
- Triangle 4: (0, 5, 9)

There are 4 unique triangles in total in this graph. So, the total number of triangles is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, and <0, 5, 9>.
