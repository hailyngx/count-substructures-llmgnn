Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [4].  
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8>.
