Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 5 is connected to nodes 2. This forms a triangle <0, 5, 2>.
2. Node 3 is connected to node 8 and 8 is connected to node 4. This creates a triangle <3, 8, 4>.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 7 is connected to node 5, creating a triangle <4, 7, 5>.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 8 and 8 is connected to node 5, making another triangle <4, 8, 5>.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 9 and 9 is connected to node 4, forming a triangle <4, 9, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
