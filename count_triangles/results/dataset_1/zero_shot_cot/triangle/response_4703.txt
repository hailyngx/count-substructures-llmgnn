Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles in the given graph:

1. (0, 2, 4)
2. (0, 4, 6)
3. (2, 0, 4)
4. (2, 4, 0)
5. (4, 0, 2)
6. (4, 2, 0)
7. (4, 3, 0)
8. (4, 3, 5)
9. (4, 5, 3)
10. (5, 4, 3)
11. (6, 0, 4)
12. (0, 4, 2)
13. (4, 2, 0)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [13].
