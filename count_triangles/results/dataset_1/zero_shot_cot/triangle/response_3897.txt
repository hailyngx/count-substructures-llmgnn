Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique group of three nodes that are interconnected by edges. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <0, 4, 5>
   - <0, 5, 7>
   - <0, 7, 8>
   - <0, 8, 9>

2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - None.

3. Triangles involving node 2:
   - <2, 4, 8>
   - <2, 4, 9>

4. Triangles involving node 3:
   - None.

5. Triangles involving node 4:
   - None.

6. Triangles involving node 5:
   - None.

7. Triangles involving node 6:
   - None.

8. Triangles involving node 7:
   - <7, 5, 4>
   - <7, 5, 0>
   - <7, 6, 8>

9. Triangles involving node 8:
   - None.

10. Triangles involving node 9:
   - None.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <7, 5, 4>, and <7, 6, 8>.
