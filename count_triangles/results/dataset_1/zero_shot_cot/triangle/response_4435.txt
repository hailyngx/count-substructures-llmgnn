Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: <1, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <0, 1, 5>, <1, 5, 6>.
