Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by connected nodes in the graph.

From the provided list of edges, we can manually check for triangles by looking at paths of length 2. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
4. Triangle <4, 7, 5>
5. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
