Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a closed triangle.

Let's go step by step to find the triangles in the graph:

1. Look for nodes that have at least two connections to other nodes:  
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 7
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 6 and 8
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4

2. Find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle 2: <2, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
