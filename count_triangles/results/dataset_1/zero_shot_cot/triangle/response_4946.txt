Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each triangle formed by nodes connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step in finding the triangles:
1. Look for each node and the pairs of nodes connected to it.
2. Check if there are any nodes that are connected to both pairs of nodes for a particular node.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
- Triangle <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle <4, 2, 1>
- Triangle <4, 7, 5>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
