Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's follow these steps:

1. Look for nodes that have edges connecting them, forming triangles.
2. Check if there is a third node that connects these two nodes to complete the triangle.
3. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's begin by listing the possible triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle 3: <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle 4: <1, 3, 9>
- Triangle 5: <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle 6: <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle 7: <2, 8, 3>
- Triangle 8: <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle 9: <3, 7, 9>
- Triangle 10: <4, 8, 0>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles, which is [10].
