Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles.
Let's identify all possible triangles in the given graph.

(0, 1, 2)
(0, 1, 6)
(0, 1, 9)
(0, 2, 6)
(0, 5, 6)
(1, 2, 6)
(1, 2, 7)
(1, 6, 7)
(2, 3, 7)
(5, 6, 7)

Step 2: Count the number of triangles.
There are 10 triangles in total. 

So, the answer is: [10]
