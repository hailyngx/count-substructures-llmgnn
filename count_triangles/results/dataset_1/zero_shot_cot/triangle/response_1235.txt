Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the given edges, the triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 3, 6>
<6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
