Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes directly connected:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 3: <4, 5, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <6, 9, 7>
   
2. Checking for triangles through common neighbor:
   - Triangle 5: <0, 1, 5>
   - Triangle 6: <0, 4, 1>
   - Triangle 7: <1, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 8: <2, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 9: <2, 4, 8>
   - Triangle 10: <9, 8, 4>
   
So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
