Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. We will ignore directionality of edges and duplicates. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to Node 1.
2. Node 1 is connected to Nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to Node 7.
4. Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1 and 9.
5. Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1, 8, and 9.
6. Node 7 is connected to Nodes 2 and 8.
7. Node 8 is connected to Nodes 5 and 7.
8. Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, and 5.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes 1, 4, and 9 form a triangle.
- Triangle 2: Nodes 1, 5, and 9 form a triangle.

Counting the total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 4, 9>
