Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph by checking all possible triplets of nodes.
    
Possible triangles:
1. (0, 6, 7)
2. (0, 6, 8)
3. (0, 7, 8)
4. (2, 5, 8)
5. (2, 5, 9)
6. (2, 8, 9)
7. (3, 4, 5)
8. (4, 5, 8)

Step 2: Count the number of triangles.
