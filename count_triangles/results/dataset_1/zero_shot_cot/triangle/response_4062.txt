Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify triangles by looking for cycles of length 3.
2. For each node, check if there are two edges connecting it to other nodes, which indicates the presence of a triangle.
3. Count the total number of triangles formed by these cycles.

Now, let's analyze the given graph:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9. No triangles are formed using node 0.

Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. 
Triangles involving node 1:
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 5, 9>

Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8. No triangles are formed using node 2.

Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 9.
Triangles involving node 3:
- <3, 1, 4>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 1, 9>
- <3, 5, 9>

Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8. No triangles are formed using node 4.

Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9. No triangles are formed using node 5.

Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2. No triangles are formed using node 6.

Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4. No triangles are formed using node 8.

Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5.
Triangles involving node 9:
- <9, 0, 5>
- <9, 1, 5>
- <9, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 10, and the unique triangles found are: [<1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 1, 4>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 1, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <9, 0, 5>, <9, 1, 5>, <9, 3, 5>].

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
