Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the unique triangles:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
