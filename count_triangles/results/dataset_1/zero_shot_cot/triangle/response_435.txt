Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Look for triangles formed by nodes connected by 2 edges:
   - Triangle <1, 4, 6> is formed by edges (1, 4), (4, 6), and (6, 1).

2. Look for triangles formed by nodes connected by 3 edges:
   - No such triangles are found in this graph.

After examining all possible triangles, we found 1 triangle in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
