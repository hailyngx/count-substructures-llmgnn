Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Number of triangles: [6]
