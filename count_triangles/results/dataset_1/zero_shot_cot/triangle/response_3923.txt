Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify such triangles step-by-step:

1. <0, 2, 1>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 7, 5>
4. <1, 2, 3>
5. <1, 2, 5>
6. <2, 3, 8>
7. <3, 8, 7>
8. <3, 1, 5>
9. <7, 5, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
