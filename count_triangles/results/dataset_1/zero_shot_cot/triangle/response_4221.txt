Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes. Let's list out the unique triangles:

1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <2, 3, 6>
5. <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
