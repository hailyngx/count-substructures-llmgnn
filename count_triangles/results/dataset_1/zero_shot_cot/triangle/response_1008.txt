Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will follow these steps:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 0.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle <1, 2, 8>
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
