Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each possible triangle formed by three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's calculate the number of triangles step-by-step.

**Step 1:** Identify the triangles:

- Node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 7), (0, 5, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 4)
- Node 2: No triangles
- Node 3: No triangles
- Node 4: (4, 1, 2)
- Node 5: (5, 0, 2), (5, 2, 3)
- Node 6: No triangles
- Node 7: (7, 0, 2), (7, 2, 3)
- Node 8: No triangles
- Node 9: No triangles

**Step 2:** Count the total number of triangles found in Step 1:

- Total number of triangles: 7

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **[7]**. The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 0, 4>, <4, 1, 2>, <5, 0, 2>, <5, 2, 3>.
