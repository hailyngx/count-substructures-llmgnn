Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected to each other.

Let's identify the unique triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
