Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph provided, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are interconnected.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 0 has connections with nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8.
2. Node 1 has connections with nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9.
3. Node 2 has connections with nodes 4 and 8.
4. Node 3 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9.
5. Node 4 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5 has connections with nodes 0 and 4.
7. Node 6 has connections with nodes 1 and 4.
8. Node 7 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, and 9.
9. Node 8 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
10. Node 9 has connections with nodes 1, 3, and 7.

Now, let's identify the unique triangles (cycles of length 3) in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
4. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <4, 8, 0>
7. Triangle <4, 8, 7>
8. Triangle <7, 8, 0>
9. Triangle <7, 8, 4>
10. Triangle <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
