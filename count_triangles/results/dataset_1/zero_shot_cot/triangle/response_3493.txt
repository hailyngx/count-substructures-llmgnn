Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes. Here are the steps to calculate it:

Step 1: List out all the triangles based on the given edges.
1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
5. Triangle <3, 1, 4>
6. Triangle <3, 1, 5>
7. Triangle <4, 1, 9>
8. Triangle <5, 3, 7>
9. Triangle <6, 0, 7>
10. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
11. Triangle <8, 0, 9>
12. Triangle <8, 6, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles from the list.
There are 12 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
