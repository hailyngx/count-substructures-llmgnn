Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
As there are 10 nodes in the given graph, we will first calculate the number of triangles.

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we will check each unique combination of 3 nodes to see if they form a triangle. A triangle is formed when each node is connected to the other two nodes forming a closed loop.

The number of triangles found in the graph is 14, and they are:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
