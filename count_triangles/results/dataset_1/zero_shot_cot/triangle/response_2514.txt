Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list all the unique triangles we can find in this graph:

1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <1, 2, 3>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <3, 4, 6>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <4, 6, 8>

There are a total of **6** triangles in this graph. Therefore, the output is **[6]**.
