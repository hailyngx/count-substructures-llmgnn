Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected, creating a closed loop.

Let's list out the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <1, 3, 4>
5. <1, 4, 8>
6. <3, 4, 8>
7. <4, 5, 8>
8. <4, 6, 5>
9. <5, 8, 6>
10. <7, 3, 9>
11. <7, 8, 9>

There are a total of 11 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [11].
