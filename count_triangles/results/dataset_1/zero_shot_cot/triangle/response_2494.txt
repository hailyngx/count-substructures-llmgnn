Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Looking at the given graph, we can list the triangles as follows:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<6, 5, 8>

There are 10 triangles in total, which are counted inside brackets as requested:
