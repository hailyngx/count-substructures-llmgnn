Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:
    - A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.
    - We will check each possible combination of three nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Checking all possible triangles:
1. (0, 2, 5)
2. (0, 2, 7)
3. (0, 2, 8)
4. (0, 2, 9)
5. (0, 5, 7)
6. (0, 5, 8)
7. (0, 5, 9)
8. (0, 7, 8)
9. (0, 7, 9)
10. (0, 8, 9)
11. (2, 5, 9)
12. (1, 2, 3)
13. (1, 2, 6)
14. (1, 2, 7)
15. (1, 2, 9)
16. (1, 3, 9)
17. (1, 6, 7)
18. (1, 6, 9)
19. (1, 7, 9)
20. (2, 5, 3)
21. (3, 4, 7)
22. (3, 4, 8)
23. (3, 7, 8)
24. (4, 7, 8)
25. (4, 8, 9)
26. (5, 9, 3)
27. (7, 6, 1)
28. (7, 6, 1)
29. (7, 6, 1)
30. (7, 6, 1)
31. (7, 6, 8)
32. (7, 6, 8)
33. (7, 6, 8)
34. (7, 6, 8)
35. (7, 6, 8)
36. (8, 9, 0)
37. (9, 3, 5)
38. (9, 1, 0)
39. (9, 1, 3)
40. (9, 1, 5)

There are a total of 40 triangles in this graph. Therefore, the answer is: [40].
