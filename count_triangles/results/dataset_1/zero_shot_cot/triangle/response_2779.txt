Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify each unique triangle formed by three connected nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 1
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to Node 3
- Node 3 is connected to Node 2
- Node 4 is connected to Node 8
- Node 7 is connected to Node 1
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1 and 8

2. Triangles in the graph:
- Triangles involving Node 1: (0, 1, 7), (1, 8, 4), (1, 8, 9)
- Total number of triangles: 3

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <1, 8, 4>, and <1, 8, 9>.
