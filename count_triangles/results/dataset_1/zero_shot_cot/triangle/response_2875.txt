Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 3), (7, 6), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 8)

To find the total number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for unique triangles formed by three nodes connected by edges. Let's identify the triangles:
1. <1, 3, 2>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 3, 6>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <5, 3, 6>
6. <6, 3, 7>
7. <8, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
