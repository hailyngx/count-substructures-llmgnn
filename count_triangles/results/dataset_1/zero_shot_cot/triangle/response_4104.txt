Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here's how we can proceed step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
    - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
    - Triangle 2: <0, 1, 5>
    - Triangle 3: <0, 1, 6>
    - Triangle 4: <0, 1, 7>
    - Triangle 5: <0, 3, 5>
    - Triangle 6: <0, 3, 6>
    - Triangle 7: <0, 5, 6>
    - Triangle 8: <0, 5, 7>
    - Triangle 9: <0, 6, 7>

2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5.
    - Triangle 10: <1, 0, 2>
    - Remaining triangles involving node 1 are already counted.

3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 7.
    - Triangle 11: <1, 2, 7>

4. Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 0, 1, and 6.
    - Remaining triangles involving node 3 are already counted.

5. Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 1.
    - Remaining triangles involving node 5 are already counted.

6. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 3.
    - Remaining triangles involving node 6 are already counted.

7. Node 7 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 2.
    - Remaining triangles involving node 7 are already counted.

8. Node 8 forms no additional triangles in the existing triangles.

9. Node 9 forms no additional triangles in the existing triangles.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
