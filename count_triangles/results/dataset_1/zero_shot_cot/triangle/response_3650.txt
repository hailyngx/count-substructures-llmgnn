Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>.
