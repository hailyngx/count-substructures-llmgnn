Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other in a triangle formation.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <1, 2, 9>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <2, 3, 6>

Total number of triangles: [4]
