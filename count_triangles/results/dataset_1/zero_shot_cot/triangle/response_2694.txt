Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each set of three nodes that are mutually connected.

Given the edges, let's list the unique triangles we can find:

1. <2, 3, 7>
2. <2, 4, 5>
3. <4, 5, 7>
4. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
