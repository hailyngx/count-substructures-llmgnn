Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the triangles in the given graph:
1. (0, 3, 9)
2. (1, 2, 9)
3. (3, 7, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles found:
Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
