Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are all interconnected. 

Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
4. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
6. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
7. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
8. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
9. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
10. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
11. Triangle <8, 0, 9>
12. Triangle <9, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
