Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
I will first list out all the triangles present in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <1, 3, 5>
5. <1, 4, 8>
6. <3, 4, 9>
7. <3, 5, 7>
8. <4, 6, 9>
9. <8, 9, 4>

There are 9 triangles in total [9].
