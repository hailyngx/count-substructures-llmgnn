Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges.
Let's count the number of triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle <0, 6, 8>
- Triangle <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle <4, 6, 9>
