Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's identify the triangles by finding the nodes that form triangles together. 

Let's list the unique triangles found within <> and then count the total number of triangles inside brackets [] at the end.

Unique Triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <8, 9, 2>

Total Number of Triangles: [9]
