Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

From the given edges, we can see the following triangles:
1. (0, 3, 8)
2. (1, 2, 5)
3. (1, 5, 9)
4. (2, 3, 5)
5. (8, 1, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the graph: <0, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, and <8, 1, 9>.
