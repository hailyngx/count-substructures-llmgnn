Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Edges:
- 1-2, 2-1
- 2-3, 2-4, 2-9
- 3-2, 3-6, 3-7, 3-8
- 4-2, 4-8
- 5-6, 5-9
- 6-3, 6-5
- 7-3
- 8-3, 8-4, 8-9
- 9-2, 9-5, 9-8

Now, let's count the number of triangles by checking each possible triangle in the graph:

1. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 9, 5>
6. Triangle <2, 9, 8>
7. Triangle <3, 6, 5>
8. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
9. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
10. Triangle <5, 6, 9>
11. Triangle <8, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
