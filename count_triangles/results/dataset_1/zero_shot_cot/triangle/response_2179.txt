Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Finding the number of triangles in a graph can be done by checking each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Look for nodes that form triangles:
- Start with node 0: Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Check for triangles involving node 0: (0, 1, 6) and (0, 3, 8) form triangles.

2. Move on to other nodes:
- Continue checking other nodes and their connections for triangles.

After examining all the nodes and their connections, we find the following unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 3, 8>

Therefore, there are **2 triangles** in total in the given graph. The answer is **[2]**.
