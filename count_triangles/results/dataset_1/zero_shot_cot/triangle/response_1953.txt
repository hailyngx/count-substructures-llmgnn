Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. 

Let's list out the triangles that exist in this graph:
1. <2, 6, 7>
2. <2, 6, 3>
3. <2, 7, 3>
4. <6, 7, 8>
5. <0, 8, 9>
6. <1, 3, 9>
7. <1, 2, 9>
8. <2, 5, 9>

So, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
