Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <1, 4, 6>
6. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
7. Triangle <1, 6, 8>
8. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
9. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
10. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
11. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
12. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
13. Triangle <4, 6, 8>
14. Triangle <5, 6, 8>

There are 14 triangles in total, so the answer is [14].
