Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph:
1. Identify all triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.
2. Count the total number of triangles.

Let's list the triangles first:
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 1>
<6, 7, 2>
<7, 8, 3>

Counting the total number of triangles, we get [12].
