Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in a graph, we need to find all possible sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected. In this case, a triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by three edges to each other.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the triangles in this graph:

1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
