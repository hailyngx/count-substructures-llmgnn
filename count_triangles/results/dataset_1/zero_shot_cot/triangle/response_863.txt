Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to 0: 3, 5, 8, 9
2. Nodes connected to 1: 4, 5
3. Nodes connected to 2: 5
4. Nodes connected to 3: 0, 4, 5
5. Nodes connected to 4: 1, 3, 5, 9
6. Nodes connected to 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
7. Nodes connected to 6: 5, 8
8. Nodes connected to 8: 0, 6
9. Nodes connected to 9: 0, 4

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle with nodes 0, 3, and 5
- Triangle with nodes 0, 4, and 5

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5> and <0, 4, 5>.
