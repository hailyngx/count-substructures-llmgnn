Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <6, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. The answer is: [6].
