Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all the combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges to form triangles.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
