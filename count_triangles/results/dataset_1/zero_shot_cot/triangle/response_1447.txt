Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each possible triangle formed by the existing edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's go through the nodes and edges to identify the triangles:

1. Triangles involving Node 0:
   - <0, 1, 7>
   - <0, 2, 9>
   - <0, 4, 9>
   - <0, 5, 6>

2. Triangles involving Node 1:
   - No triangles involving Node 1.

3. Triangles involving Node 2:
   - No triangles involving Node 2.

4. Triangles involving Node 4:
   - No triangles involving Node 4.

5. Triangles involving Node 5:
   - No triangles involving Node 5.

6. Triangles involving Node 6:
   - No triangles involving Node 6.

7. Triangles involving Node 7:
   - No triangles involving Node 7.

8. Triangles involving Node 8:
   - No triangles involving Node 8.

9. Triangles involving Node 9:
   - No triangles involving Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, and <0, 5, 6>.
