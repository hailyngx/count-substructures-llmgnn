Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Look for triangles formed by each node:
- Triangle with node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 5, 6), (0, 7, 8), (0, 8, 9)
- Triangle with node 1: (1, 0, 8), (1, 2, 5), (1, 9, 0)
- Triangle with node 2: (2, 1, 5)
- Triangle with node 4: None
- Triangle with node 5: (5, 0, 6), (5, 0, 7), (5, 7, 8)
- Triangle with node 6: (6, 0, 5)
- Triangle with node 7: (7, 0, 5)
- Triangle with node 8: (8, 0, 5)
- Triangle with node 9: (9, 0, 1)

2. List the unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 9, 0>
- <5, 7, 8>

3. Calculate the total number of triangles: [7]
