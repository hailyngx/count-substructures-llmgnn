Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Looking at the given edges, we can start identifying the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 2>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <1, 5, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 2, 4>
7. Triangle <3, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in total in the given graph. 

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
