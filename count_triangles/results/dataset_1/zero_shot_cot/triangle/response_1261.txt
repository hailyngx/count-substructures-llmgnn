Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to search for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Here's how we can do it step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles:
   - Look for each node and find any pairs of connected nodes.
   - Check if there is a third edge that connects these pairs to form a triangle.

2. Count the triangles:
   - List the unique triangles found.
   - Output the total number of unique triangles.

After analyzing the given graph, we have found the following triangles:
- <1, 6, 8>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
