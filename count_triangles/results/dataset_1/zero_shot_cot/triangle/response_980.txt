Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found inside <> each only once are <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 9>.
