Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first find the triangles in this graph. A triangle is a set of three nodes connected pairwise by edges.

For each node, we'll check if there are two edges that connect the node with two other nodes, creating a triangle. We'll list the triangles as we find them:

1. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
4. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
6. Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
