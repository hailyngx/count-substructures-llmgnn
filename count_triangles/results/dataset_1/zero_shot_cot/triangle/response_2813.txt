Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for cycles of length 3 (triangles) among the nodes connected by edges.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle 1: <0, 4, 9>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 6, 1>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 4, 3>
4. Triangle 4: <0, 8, 2>
5. Triangle 5: <2, 8, 7>
6. Triangle 6: <4, 3, 9>
7. Triangle 7: <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
