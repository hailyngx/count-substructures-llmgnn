Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's find these triangles step-by-step:

1. Nodes directly connected:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
   - Node 2 is connected to node 8.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
   - Node 6 is connected to node 9.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.

2. Triangles:
   - <1, 3, 4>
   - <8, 4, 9>
   - <9, 7, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
