Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's analyze the given graph:

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to node 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. Nodes 0, 2, and 6 form a triangle.
2. Nodes 0, 5, and 9 form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6> and <0, 5, 9>.
