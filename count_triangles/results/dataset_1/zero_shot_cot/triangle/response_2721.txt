Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. 

Let's start by looking at each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.

Let's check for triangles:
1. Triangles with node 0:
   - (0, 3, 4)
   - (0, 5, 2)
   - (0, 7, 9)

2. Triangles with node 1:
   - No triangles.

3. Triangles with node 2:
   - No triangles.

4. Triangles with node 3:
   - No triangles.

5. Triangles with node 4:
   - (4, 1, 9)
   - (4, 3, 0)
   - (4, 6, 2)

6. Triangles with node 5:
   - (5, 0, 7)
   - (5, 2, 6)

7. Triangles with node 6:
   - No triangles.

8. Triangles with node 7:
   - No triangles.

9. Triangles with node 8:
   - No triangles.

10. Triangles with node 9:
    - No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 7, 9>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 3, 0>, and <4, 6, 2>.
