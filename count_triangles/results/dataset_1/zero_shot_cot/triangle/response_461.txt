Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes which are all interconnected by edges.

Let's start by identifying all the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 0, 8>
7. Triangle <3, 0, 9>
8. Triangle <4, 1, 7>
9. Triangle <6, 0, 4>
10. Triangle <6, 0, 5>
11. Triangle <6, 0, 9>
12. Triangle <6, 2, 5>
13. Triangle <6, 2, 9>
14. Triangle <6, 4, 5>
15. Triangle <6, 4, 7>
16. Triangle <9, 1, 3>
17. Triangle <9, 1, 7>
18. Triangle <9, 3, 6>
19. Triangle <9, 3, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of 19 triangles in the given graph. So, the number of triangles is [19].
