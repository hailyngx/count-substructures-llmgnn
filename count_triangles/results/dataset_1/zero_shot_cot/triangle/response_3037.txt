Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's start by identifying the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 2, 6>

Now, we count the total number of triangles:
