Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the connected nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Since we have 10 nodes, let's examine each node's connections to find the triangles:

- Node 0 is connected with nodes 5.
- Node 1 is connected with nodes 2, 6.
- Node 2 is connected with nodes 1, 7.
- Node 3 is connected with nodes 6, 9.
- Node 4 is connected with nodes 9.
- Node 5 is connected with nodes 0, 9.
- Node 6 is connected with nodes 1, 3, 9.
- Node 7 is connected with node 2.
- Node 9 is connected with nodes 3, 4, 5, 6.

Now, let's list the triangles:
- <1, 2, 6>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
