Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of paths of length 2 (triangles) between nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find all the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0: Can form triangles with nodes 1, 3, and 8.
2. Node 1: Can form a triangle with nodes 0 and 8.
3. Node 3: Can form triangles with nodes 0, 4, 6, 9.
4. Node 4: Can form triangles with nodes 6 and 9.
5. Node 5: No triangles.
6. Node 6: Can form a triangle with node 7.
7. Node 7: Can form a triangle with nodes 8 and 9.
8. Node 8: No additional triangles.
9. Node 9: No additional triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13], and the unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 8, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, <2, 7, 5>.
