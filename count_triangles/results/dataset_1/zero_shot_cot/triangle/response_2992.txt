Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Looking at the edges given, we can identify the triangles by checking for nodes that have connections to form a closed loop among three nodes. Here are the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <8, 2, 6>
3. <8, 4, 0>
4. <8, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
