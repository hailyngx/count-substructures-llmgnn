Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph information, let's count the number of triangles:

1. For each node, find all possible triangles that can be formed with that node.
2. Calculate the total number of unique triangles in the graph.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 6, 8>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <2, 3, 7>
5. <1, 2, 4>
6. <0, 8, 3>
7. <0, 8, 6>
8. <0, 9, 6>
9. <6, 1, 4>
10. <2, 7, 3>
11. <1, 6, 2>
12. <0, 6, 1>

In total, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
