Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the triangles in the graph based on the given edges. A triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <2, 1, 9>
5. <2, 6, 7>
6. <2, 6, 8>
7. <4, 6, 8>
8. <6, 5, 4>
9. <6, 7, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. It seems there are 9 unique triangles in the graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
