Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we can find the triangles using the given information. Since a triangle consists of three nodes connected by edges, we need to find all the combinations of three nodes that form triangles.

Looking at the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7.

Let's find the triangles:
1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 1, and 9: <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle involving nodes 1, 4, and 9: <1, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
