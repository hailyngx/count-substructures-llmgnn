Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, let's calculate the total number of triangles.

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Starting with the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <2, 5, 6>
5. <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
