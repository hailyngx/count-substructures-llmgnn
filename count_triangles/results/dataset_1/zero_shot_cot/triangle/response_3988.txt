Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node in the graph.

| Node | Degree |
|------|--------|
| 0    | 3      |
| 1    | 3      |
| 2    | 2      |
| 3    | 2      |
| 4    | 2      |
| 5    | 2      |
| 6    | 1      |
| 7    | 6      |
| 8    | 4      |
| 9    | 2      |

Step 2: Count the number of triangles in the graph.

From the given edges, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 8>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 5>, <4, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
