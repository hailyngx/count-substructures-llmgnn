Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6.

Let's list the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <0, 4, 6>
5. <0, 6, 9>
6. <2, 4, 7>
7. <3, 4, 9>
8. <4, 6, 7>
9. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
