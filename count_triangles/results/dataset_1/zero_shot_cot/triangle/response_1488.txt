Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 triangles in this graph. 
The triangles are: 
<3, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
