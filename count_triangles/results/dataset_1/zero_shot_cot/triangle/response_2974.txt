Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
   - Node 0, 1, and 7 form a triangle <0, 1, 7>.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
   - Node 1, 0, and 7 form a triangle <0, 1, 7>.
   - Node 1, 0, and 8 do not form a triangle.
   - Node 1, 7, and 8 do not form a triangle.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 8.
   - Node 2 is not part of any triangle.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
   - Node 3, 5, and 6 form a triangle <3, 5, 6>.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
   - Node 4, 7, and 9 form a triangle <4, 7, 9>.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
   - Node 5, 3, and 6 form a triangle <3, 5, 6>.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
   - Node 6, 3, and 5 form a triangle <3, 5, 6>.
   - Node 6, 5, and 7 form a triangle <3, 5, 6>.
   - Node 6, 3, and 7 form a triangle <3, 5, 6>.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6.
   - Node 7, 0, and 1 form a triangle <0, 1, 7>.
   - Node 7, 0, and 4 do not form a triangle.
   - Node 7, 0, and 6 form a triangle <0, 1, 7>.
   - Node 7, 1, and 4 do not form a triangle.
   - Node 7, 1, and 6 form a triangle <0, 1, 7>.
   - Node 7, 4, and 6 form a triangle <4, 7, 6>.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
   - Node 8, 1, and 2 do not form a triangle.
   - Node 8, 1, and 9 do not form a triangle.
   - Node 8, 2, and 9 do not form a triangle.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
    - Node 9, 4, and 8 form a triangle <4, 7, 9>.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
