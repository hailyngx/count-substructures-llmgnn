Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<2, 0, 1>
<2, 0, 5>
<2, 1, 3>
<2, 1, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
