Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the graph:
1. (0, 2, 6)
2. (2, 3, 6)
3. (2, 6, 8)
4. (3, 4, 8)
5. (2, 6, 3)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
