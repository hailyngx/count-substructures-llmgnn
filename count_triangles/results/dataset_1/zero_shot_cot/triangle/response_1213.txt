Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique triangles within the graph.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 3>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 8, 3>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 4, 3>
<6, 4, 9>
<6, 9, 5>
<8, 5, 3>
<8, 5, 9>
<8, 9, 5>

Total number of triangles: [13]
