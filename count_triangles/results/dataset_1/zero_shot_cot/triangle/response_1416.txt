Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
From the given graph, we can determine the total number of triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other in a way that forms a triangle. Let's find the triangles step by step:

1. Starting from node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
   - Among these connections, we can find one triangle: <0, 2, 9>.

2. Moving on to node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
   - There are no triangles involving node 2 that we haven't already counted.

3. Proceeding to node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 7.
   - Among these connections, we can find two more triangles: <0, 6, 9> and <3, 5, 6>.

4. Continuing to node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
   - There are no triangles involving node 8 that we haven't already counted.

5. Finally, looking at node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8.
   - Among these connections, we have already identified the triangle <0, 2, 9> and <0, 6, 9>.
   
Based on the connections in the graph, we have found a total of 3 unique triangles: <0, 2, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, and <3, 5, 6>. Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
