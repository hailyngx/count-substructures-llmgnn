Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Look for triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.
2. Count the number of triangles formed.
3. List the unique triangles found.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 5, 2>
<7, 5, 3>
<7, 5, 6>
<8, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
