Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9. However, nodes 3 and 9 are not directly connected, so there is no triangle involving node 0.

2. Node 1 is connected to node 2, but no other connection is present for a triangle involving node 1.

3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 5. <1, 2, 5>

4. Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 4 and 5. <3, 4, 5>

5. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 7. <4, 5, 7>

6. Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 9. <2, 5, 9>

7. Nodes 6, 7, and 8 do not form any triangles in this graph.

8. Node 8 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 9. <2, 8, 9>

9. Node 9 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5. <0, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
