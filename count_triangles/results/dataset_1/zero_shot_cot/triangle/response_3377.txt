Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the given graph, let's identify the triangles present:
1. (1, 3, 5)
2. (1, 5, 7)
3. (2, 4, 9)
4. (4, 5, 8)
5. (5, 6, 7)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
