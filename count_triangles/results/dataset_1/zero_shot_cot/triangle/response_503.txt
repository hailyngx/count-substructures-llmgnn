Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 0.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 4: <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle 5: <3, 5, 6>
- Triangle 6: <4, 5, 6>

Count of triangles: [6]
