Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.

Now, let's list the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 2: <1, 6, 7>

Counting the total number of triangles gives us [2].
