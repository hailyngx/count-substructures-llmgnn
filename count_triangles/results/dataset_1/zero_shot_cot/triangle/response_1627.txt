Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 2, 9>.
