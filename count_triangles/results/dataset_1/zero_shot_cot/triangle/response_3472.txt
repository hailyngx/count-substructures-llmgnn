Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: degree = 5
- Node 1: degree = 1
- Node 2: degree = 3
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 2
- Node 5: degree = 1
- Node 6: degree = 2
- Node 7: degree = 1
- Node 8: degree = 5
- Node 9: degree = 1

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles in the graph.
- To form a triangle, we need to find nodes that are connected in a cycle of length 3.
- Let's check for each possible triangle:
1. Triangle involving Node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 3, 8), (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 2), (0, 4, 2), (0, 8, 7), (0, 8, 3)
2. Triangle involving Node 1: None
3. Triangle involving Node 2: (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 8), (2, 4, 8)
4. Triangle involving Node 3: None
5. Triangle involving Node 4: None
6. Triangle involving Node 5: None
7. Triangle involving Node 6: None
8. Triangle involving Node 7: None
9. Triangle involving Node 8: (8, 3, 7)
10. Triangle involving Node 9: None

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles.
- Total number of triangles: 9
