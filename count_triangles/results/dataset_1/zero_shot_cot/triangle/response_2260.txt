Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for the number of unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the triangles:
1. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
3. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
4. Triangle <3, 7, 5>
5. Triangle <4, 1, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
