Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph by looking for nodes that form complete cycles of length 3. 

The possible triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <1, 3, 5>
5. <1, 3, 7>
6. <1, 5, 7>
7. <1, 6, 7>
8. <2, 7, 8>
9. <4, 6, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [9 triangles] in the given graph.
