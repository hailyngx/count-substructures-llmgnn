Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the total number of triangles in this graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify the triangles
Triangles are formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's list down the unique triangles:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <0, 4, 6>
5. <2, 6, 9>
6. <3, 6, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles
There are 6 unique triangles in this graph. So, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
