Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.

We will now list the triangles <a, b, c> in the graph:

1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 7, 5>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <5, 7, 9>
6. <5, 9, 7>

Counting the unique triangles, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
