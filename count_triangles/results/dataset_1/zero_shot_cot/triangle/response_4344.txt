Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each possible triangle formed by 3 nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0: 
   - Forms a triangle with (1, 4) and (0, 8). <0, 1, 4>
2. Node 1: 
   - Forms a triangle with (0, 1) and (1, 7). <0, 1, 7>
3. Node 3: 
   - Forms a triangle with (1, 3) and (3, 9). <1, 3, 9>
4. Node 9:
   - Forms a triangle with (2, 9) and (5, 9). <2, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
