Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each set of 3 nodes to see if they form a triangle by having edges between each pair of nodes.

Let's go through each possible triangle:

1. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
4. Triangle <1, 7, 4>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 9>

Now, let's count the number of triangles inside brackets []:
