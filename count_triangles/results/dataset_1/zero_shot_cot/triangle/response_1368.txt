Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
This is the calculation for counting the number of triangles in the given graph:
- A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges to each other.
- To count the number of triangles, we look for nodes that have two edges connecting them.
- We then find the third node connected to both of these nodes to complete the triangle.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. Triangle: <1, 7, 9>
2. Triangle: <1, 8, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
