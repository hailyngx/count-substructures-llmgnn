Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Checking each combination of three nodes, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <2, 5, 6>
5. <2, 5, 7>
6. <2, 6, 7>
7. <3, 4, 7>
8. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
