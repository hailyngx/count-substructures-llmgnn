Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles in the graph:
- Triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 8, 9>
- Triangles involving node 1: <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>
- Triangles involving node 2: <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>
- Triangles involving node 3: <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>
- Triangles involving node 4: None
- Triangles involving node 5: <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>
- Triangles involving node 6: <6, 7, 9>
- Triangles involving node 7: None
- Triangles involving node 8: None
- Triangles involving node 9: None

Now, counting the total number of triangles: [16]
