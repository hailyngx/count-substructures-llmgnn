Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can identify each triangle formed by three nodes and check if there is an edge between each pair of these nodes.

The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
