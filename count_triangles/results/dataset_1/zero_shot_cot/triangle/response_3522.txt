Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for each possible triangle in the graph based on the given edges. 

Here are the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <1, 3, 5>
5. <1, 4, 6>
6. <2, 0, 4>
7. <2, 4, 5>
8. <4, 0, 2>
9. <4, 1, 6>
10. <4, 6, 5>
11. <5, 2, 4>
12. <5, 4, 6>
13. <7, 0, 5>
14. <7, 5, 9>
15. <9, 4, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.
