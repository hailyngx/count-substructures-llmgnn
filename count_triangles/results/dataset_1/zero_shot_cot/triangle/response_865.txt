Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all interconnected. Let's go step-by-step to find the total number of triangles in the graph:

1. Identify all possible triangles by looking at the connections between nodes:
   - Possible triangles involving node 0: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 1: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 2: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 3: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 4: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 5: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 6: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 7: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 8: None
   - Possible triangles involving node 9: None

2. Based on the given edges, there are no triangles found in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [0].
