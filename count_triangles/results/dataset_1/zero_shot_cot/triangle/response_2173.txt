Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Triangle involving node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
   - This forms triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 5>.

2. Triangle involving node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 8, and 9.
   - This forms triangles: <1, 3, 8>.

3. Triangle involving node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
   - This forms triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 9>.

4. Triangle involving node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5.
   - This forms triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 5>.

5. Triangle involving node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9.
   - This forms a triangle: <0, 2, 5>.

6. Triangle involving node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7.
   - This forms no additional unique triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
