Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 triangles in this graph. Here is the list of unique triangles:
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
  
Therefore, there are a total of 3 triangles in this graph. [3]
