Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every combination of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by listing down all the triangles we can find in this graph:

1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <0, 6, 8>
5. <1, 6, 7>
6. <2, 3, 7>
7. <4, 5, 9>
8. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
