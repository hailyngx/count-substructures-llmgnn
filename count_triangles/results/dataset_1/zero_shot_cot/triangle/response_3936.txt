Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes and edges. Here is the step-by-step process to calculate the total number of triangles in the graph:

1. Look for triangles formed by each node:
   a. Node 0: <0, 2, 5>
   b. Node 1: No triangles
   c. Node 2: <2, 0, 4> and <2, 3, 7>
   d. Node 3: No triangles
   e. Node 4: No triangles
   f. Node 5: No triangles
   g. Node 6: No triangles
   h. Node 7: No triangles
   i. Node 8: No triangles
   j. Node 9: <9, 0, 5> and <9, 3, 4>

2. Calculate the total number of unique triangles:
   - <0, 2, 5>
   - <2, 0, 4>
   - <2, 3, 7>
   - <9, 0, 5>
   - <9, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
