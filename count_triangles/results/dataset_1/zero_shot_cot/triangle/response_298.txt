Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that form triangles. A triangle occurs when three nodes are interconnected. Let's start by listing out the triangles:

1. Nodes (2, 6, 7)
2. Nodes (2, 7, 9)
3. Nodes (4, 7, 9)

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the total number of triangles is [3].
