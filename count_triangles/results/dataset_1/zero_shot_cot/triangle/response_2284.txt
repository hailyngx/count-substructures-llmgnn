Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in a graph, we can look for every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 5, 4>
- Triangle 2: <5, 4, 7>
- Triangle 3: <5, 4, 8>
- Triangle 4: <5, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
