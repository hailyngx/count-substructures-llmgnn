Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, and <1, 5, 7>.
