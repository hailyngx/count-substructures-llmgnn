Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <0, 3, 8>
5. <1, 3, 6>
6. <1, 4, 5>
7. <3, 6, 9>
8. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
