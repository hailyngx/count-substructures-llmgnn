Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected.

Looking at the given graph, we will determine the triangles by finding sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Let's identify and count the triangles:

1. Possible triangles involving Node 0:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 2, 9>

2. Possible triangles involving Node 1:
   No new triangles with Node 1.

3. Possible triangles involving Node 2:
   No new triangles with Node 2.

4. Possible triangles involving Node 3:
   No new triangles with Node 3.

5. Possible triangles involving Node 4:
   No new triangles with Node 4.

6. Possible triangles involving Node 5:
   No new triangles with Node 5.

7. Possible triangles involving Node 6:
   No new triangles with Node 6.

8. Possible triangles involving Node 7:
   No new triangles with Node 7.

9. Possible triangles involving Node 8:
   No new triangles with Node 8.

10. Possible triangles involving Node 9:
   - Triangle 3: <9, 6, 3>
   - Triangle 4: <9, 0, 2>
   - Triangle 5: <9, 0, 4>
   - Triangle 6: <9, 4, 7>
   - Triangle 7: <9, 7, 3>
   - Triangle 8: <9, 8, 1>
   - Triangle 9: <9, 8, 3>
   - Triangle 10: <9, 8, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 unique triangles present in the given graph. Hence, the output is: [10].
