Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can refer to the information already provided and observe the connections between the nodes. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 5. Check if nodes 2 and 5 are connected: Yes, there is an edge between nodes 2 and 5, so triangle <0, 2, 5> is found.

2. Move on to the next node - Node 1. Node 1 is connected to node 5. There are no triangles involving node 1 in the given graph.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9. Check for triangles involving node 2:
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5> was already found.
   - No other triangles involving node 2 in this graph.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 9. Check for triangles involving node 3:
   - No triangles involving node 3 in this graph.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7. Check for triangles involving node 4:
   - No triangles involving node 4 in this graph.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, and 9. Check for triangles involving node 5:
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5> was already found.
   - No other triangles involving node 5 in this graph.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9. Check for triangles involving node 6:
   - No triangles involving node 6 in this graph.

8. Node 7 is connected to node 4. There are no triangles involving node 7 in this graph.

9. Node 8 is connected to node 5. There are no triangles involving node 8 in this graph.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6. Check for triangles involving node 9:
   - No triangles involving node 9 in this graph.

In this graph, we found only one triangle: <0, 2, 5>. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
