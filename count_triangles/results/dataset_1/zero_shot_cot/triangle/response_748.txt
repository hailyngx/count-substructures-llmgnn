Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's break down the process of counting the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles:
   - A triangle is formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other.
   - We need to find all possible combinations of three nodes that form triangles in this graph.

2. Given edges:
   - (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8)
   - (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7)
   - (2, 3) (2, 4)
   - (3, 1) (3, 2)
   - (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9)
   - (5, 4) (5, 9)
   - (6, 4)
   - (7, 1)
   - (8, 0) (8, 4)
   - (9, 4) (9, 5)

3. Let's find the triangles:
   - After going through the graph, we find the following unique triangles in the provided graph:
      - <0, 1, 4>
      - <0, 4, 8>
      - <1, 3, 2>
      - <4, 8, 0>
      - <4, 8, 9>
      - <4, 9, 5>

4. Count the total number of triangles:
   - The total number of triangles found in the graph is [6].
