Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 2, 8>
4. <0, 3, 5>
5. <0, 7, 5>
6. <0, 7, 8>
7. <0, 8, 1>
8. <0, 8, 9>
9. <0, 9, 4>
10. <3, 5, 7>
11. <4, 6, 9>
12. <5, 1, 8>
13. <5, 3, 7>
14. <6, 4, 9>
15. <6, 7, 0>
16. <7, 0, 8>
17. <7, 5, 1>
18. <7, 6, 4>

So, there are a total of [18] triangles in the given graph.
