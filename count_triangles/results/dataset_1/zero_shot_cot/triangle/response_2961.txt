Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles involving three nodes that are connected by edges. 

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's list out the unique triangles that we can observe in this graph: 
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
