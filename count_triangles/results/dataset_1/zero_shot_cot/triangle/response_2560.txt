Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

Step 1: Look for triangles involving each node: 
1. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 8), (5, 8) - <0, 5, 8>
2. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 5) - <1, 3, 5>
3. Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 5) - <2, 4, 5>
4. Node 3: (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 5) - Already counted
5. Node 4: (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 5) - Already counted
6. Node 5: Already counted
7. Node 6: (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 8) - <5, 6, 8>
8. Node 7: (1, 7), (1, 5), (5, 7) - <1, 5, 7>
9. Node 8: Already counted
10. Node 9: (2, 9) (2, 5), (5, 9) - <2, 5, 9>

Step 2: Count the number of unique triangles:
1. <0, 5, 8>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <2, 4, 5>
4. <5, 6, 8>
5. <1, 5, 7>
6. <2, 5, 9>

Therefore, total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
