Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We'll list the triangles as we find them:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <1, 5, 7>
3. <1, 7, 8>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
