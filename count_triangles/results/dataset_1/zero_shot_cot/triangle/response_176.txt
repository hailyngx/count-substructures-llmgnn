Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph, let's count the number of triangles. 
A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. 
Let's list down the triangles that can be formed based on the given edges:
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 0>
<1, 6, 3>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<8, 5, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles present in the given graph is [7].
