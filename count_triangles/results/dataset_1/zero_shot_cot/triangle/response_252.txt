Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 1, 7)
2. Triangle 2: (3, 4, 5)
3. Triangle 3: (3, 7, 8)

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. Unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <3, 4, 5>, and <3, 7, 8>.
