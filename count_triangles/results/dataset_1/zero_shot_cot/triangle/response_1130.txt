Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be counted by looking at each node pair that is connected by an edge and seeing if there is a third node to close the triangle. Let's calculate the total number of triangles in this graph.

Starting the calculation: 
For node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 7), (0, 1, 8), (0, 1, 9), (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 7), (0, 2, 8), (0, 2, 9), (0, 4, 7), (0, 4, 8), (0, 4, 9), (0, 7, 8), (0, 7, 9), (0, 8, 9) -> 14 triangles so far.

For node 1: (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 9) -> 2 triangles.

For node 2: (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 8) -> 2 triangles.

For node 3: No additional triangles.

For node 4: (4, 5, 6), (4, 5, 8), (4, 5, 9), (4, 6, 8), (4, 6, 9), (4, 7, 8), (4, 7, 9) -> 7 triangles.

For node 5: No additional triangles.

For node 6: No additional triangles.

For node 7: (7, 8, 9) -> 1 triangle.

For node 8: No additional triangles.

For node 9: No additional triangles.

Summing all these up gives 14 + 2 + 2 + 7 + 1 = 26 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [26].
