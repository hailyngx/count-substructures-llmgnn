Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <1, 2, 9>
4. <1, 5, 8>
5. <1, 5, 9>
6. <1, 6, 9>
7. <1, 7, 9>
8. <2, 5, 9>
9. <2, 8, 9>
10. <5, 6, 9>
11. <5, 8, 9>
12. <6, 7, 9>
13. <7, 8, 9>

In total, there are [13] triangles in the graph.
