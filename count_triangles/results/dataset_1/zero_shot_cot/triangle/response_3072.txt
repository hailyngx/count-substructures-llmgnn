Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Step 1: Identify nodes that are connected to form triangles
- <0, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <3, 6, 4>
- <7, 6, 8>
- <3, 7, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles
- Total number of triangles: [7]
