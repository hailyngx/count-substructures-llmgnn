Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles are <0, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 9>.
