Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the edges.

Given edges:
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4)
(1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9)
(2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)
(3, 1)
(4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9)
(5, 1), (5, 4)
(6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 9)
(7, 2)
(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6)
(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6)

Now, let's list all the triangles found:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 0>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 0>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 4>
<2, 4, 0>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 6>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 4>
<2, 8, 6>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 9, 6>
<4, 8, 6>
<4, 9, 6>

Count of triangles: [21]
