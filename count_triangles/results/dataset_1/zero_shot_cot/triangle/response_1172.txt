Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a triangle. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <1, 5, 6>
2. <1, 5, 8>
3. <1, 6, 4>
4. <2, 5, 8>
5. <4, 5, 6>
6. <4, 5, 8>
7. <6, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
