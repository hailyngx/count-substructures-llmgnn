Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given graph has the following edges:

(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 3), (7, 4), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Let's count the number of triangles by examining each possible triangle formed by the nodes:

1. Triangles involving node 1:
   - (1, 4, 5)

2. Triangles involving node 2:
   - No triangles involving node 2.

3. Triangles involving node 3:
   - (3, 4, 7)
   - (3, 6, 9)

4. Triangles involving node 4:
   - (4, 1, 5)
   - (4, 3, 7)

5. Triangles involving node 5:
   - No triangles involving node 5.

6. Triangles involving node 6:
   - No triangles involving node 6.

7. Triangles involving node 7:
   - No triangles involving node 7.

8. Triangles involving node 9:
   - (9, 1, 5)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4] as shown in the unique triangles below:

<1, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <9, 1, 5>.
