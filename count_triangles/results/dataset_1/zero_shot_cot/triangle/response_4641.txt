Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle <1, 5, 9>
- Triangle <2, 9, 5>
- Triangle <4, 7, 9>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
