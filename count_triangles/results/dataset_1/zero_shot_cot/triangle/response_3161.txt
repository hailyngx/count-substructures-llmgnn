Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 0.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 2, 8>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>

Counting the unique triangles found, we have [6] triangles in total.
