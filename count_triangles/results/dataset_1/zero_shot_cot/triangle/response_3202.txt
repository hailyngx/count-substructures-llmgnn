Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By counting the number of triangles in the given graph, we follow the steps:
1. Identify each triangle in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 2)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 4, 7)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 4, 9)
   - Triangle 4: (2, 4, 7)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 4, 9)
   - Triangle 6: (2, 5, 8)
   - Triangle 7: (4, 7, 9)
   - Triangle 8: (5, 7, 9)

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total in the given graph.

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
