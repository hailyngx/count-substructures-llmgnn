Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.

Based on the connections above, the triangles formed are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <3, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
