Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, we can determine the number of triangles by identifying sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step in finding the triangles:

1. Nodes 1, 4, and 8 form a triangle: (1, 4), (4, 8), (1, 8).
2. Nodes 2, 3, and 9 form a triangle: (2, 3), (3, 9), (2, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 8> and <2, 3, 9>.
