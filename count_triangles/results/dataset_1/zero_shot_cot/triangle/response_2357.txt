Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. In this case, we can identify the triangles based on the given edges. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Triangle 1: Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4. So, the triangle <0, 1, 3> is formed.

2. Triangle 2: Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7. So, the triangle <0, 1, 2> is formed.

3. Triangle 3: Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 2. So, the triangle <1, 7, 9> is formed.

4. Triangle 4: Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9. So, the triangle <8, 0, 2> is formed.

5. Triangle 5: Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8. So, the triangle <9, 1, 6> is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
