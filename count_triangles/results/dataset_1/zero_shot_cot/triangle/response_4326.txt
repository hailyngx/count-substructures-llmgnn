Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, let's analyze the triangles formed by the connected nodes:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 8>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 7, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
7. Triangle <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
