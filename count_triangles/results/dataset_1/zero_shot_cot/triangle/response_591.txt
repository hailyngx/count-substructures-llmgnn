Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. In this case, counting manually reveals the following triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
4. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
7. Triangle <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
