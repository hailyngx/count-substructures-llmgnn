Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will list all the triangles in the graph and then count the total number of triangles.

Triangles:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<2, 0, 9>
<2, 8, 5>
<3, 0, 9>
<5, 1, 8>
<5, 3, 6>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 4, 5>
<9, 7, 6>

Total number of triangles: [10]
