Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) 

Response:
In order to find the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Identify all the triangles formed by 3 nodes connected by edges.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 7>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
