Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the unique triangles present in the graph:

1. <1, 4, 6>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <2, 8, 6>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <4, 6, 7>
6. <4, 6, 9>
7. <4, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
