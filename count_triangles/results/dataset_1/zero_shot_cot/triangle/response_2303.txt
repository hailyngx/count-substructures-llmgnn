Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list out the triangles based on the given edges:
1. Nodes 0, 1, 4 form a triangle.
2. Nodes 3, 4, 9 form a triangle.
3. Nodes 3, 5, 6 form a triangle.
4. Nodes 3, 7, 8 form a triangle.

Counting these triangles gives us a total of [4] triangles. 

Thus, the unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 4>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 7, 8>.
