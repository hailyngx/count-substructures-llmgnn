Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 8, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 8>.
