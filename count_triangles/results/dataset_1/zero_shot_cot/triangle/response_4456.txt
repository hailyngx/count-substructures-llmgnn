Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. A triangle is formed when three nodes are mutually connected.

Let's start by listing all the triangles we can find in the graph:

1. <0, 4, 2>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <2, 4, 7>
6. <2, 6, 7>
7. <3, 7, 8>
8. <4, 5, 8>
9. <4, 7, 6>
10. <5, 8, 7>
11. <9, 0, 1>
12. <9, 0, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
