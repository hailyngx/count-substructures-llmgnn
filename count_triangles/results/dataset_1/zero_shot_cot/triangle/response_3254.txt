Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the given edges. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <1, 4, 6>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <1, 6, 8>
6. <1, 7, 9>
7. <1, 9, 3>
8. <3, 4, 1>
9. <3, 4, 7>
10. <3, 7, 9>
11. <6, 7, 9>
12. <6, 8, 9>
[Total number of triangles: 12]
