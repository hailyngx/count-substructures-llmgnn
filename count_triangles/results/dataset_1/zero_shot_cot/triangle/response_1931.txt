Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Looking at the edges, we can see that the possible triangles involving node 0 are:
   - (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 3)
   
2. The possible triangles involving node 1 are:
   - (1, 4), (1, 5), (4, 5)
   - (1, 8), (1, 4), (4, 8)
   
3. The possible triangles involving node 2 are:
   - (2, 0), (2, 4), (0, 4)
   - (2, 4), (2, 8), (4, 8)
   
4. The possible triangles involving node 3 are:
   - (3, 0), (3, 4), (0, 4)
   - (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)
   - (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 7)
   - (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 9)
   
5. The possible triangles involving node 4 are:
   - (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 2)
   - (4, 2), (4, 3), (2, 3)
   - (4, 3), (4, 6), (3, 6)
   - (4, 7), (4, 8), (7, 8)
   
6. The possible triangles involving node 5 are:
   - (5, 1), (5, 3), (1, 3)
   - (5, 3), (5, 7), (3, 7)
   
7. The possible triangles involving node 7 are:
   - (7, 3), (7, 4), (3, 4)
   - (7, 4), (7, 5), (4, 5)
   
8. The possible triangles involving node 8 are:
   - (8, 1), (8, 4), (1, 4)
   - (8, 2), (8, 4), (2, 4)
   
9. The possible triangles involving node 9 are:
   - (2, 9), (3, 9), (2, 3)
   
Counting all these triangles, we find that there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the output is: [10]
