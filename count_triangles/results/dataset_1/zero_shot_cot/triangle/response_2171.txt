Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by nodes connected by edges in the graph.

1. Let's list all the triangles found in the graph:
   - <0, 3, 8>
   - <0, 3, 9>
   - <3, 4, 7>
   - <3, 6, 8>
   - <3, 7, 8>

2. Now, we count the total number of unique triangles found:
   - Total number of triangles: [5]
