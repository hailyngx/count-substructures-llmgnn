Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other forming a triangle. Let's analyze the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
    - Neighbors of Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6.
    - Possible triangles involving Node 0: 
        - <0, 1, 4>
        - <0, 3, 6>

2. Node 1:
    - Neighbors of Node 1: 0, 4.
    - Possible triangle involving Node 1: None.

3. Node 2:
    - Neighbors of Node 2: 6, 7, 8, 9.
    - Possible triangles involving Node 2: None.

4. Node 3:
    - Neighbors of Node 3: 0, 7.
    - Possible triangle involving Node 3: None.

5. Node 4:
    - Neighbors of Node 4: 0, 1, 6.
    - Possible triangles involving Node 4: 
        - <0, 1, 4>

6. Node 5:
    - Neighbors of Node 5: 6, 8.
    - Possible triangle involving Node 5: None.

7. Node 6:
    - Neighbors of Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.
    - Possible triangles involving Node 6: 
        - <0, 4, 6>

8. Node 7:
    - Neighbors of Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 8.
    - Possible triangles involving Node 7: None.

9. Node 8:
    - Neighbors of Node 8: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9.
    - Possible triangles involving Node 8: None.

10. Node 9:
    - Neighbors of Node 9: 2, 6, 8.
    - Possible triangles involving Node 9: None.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4> and <0, 4, 6>.
