Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected in a triangular shape. Let's start step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
6. Node 6 is connected to node 2.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.

From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:

1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <2, 6, 7>
4. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
