Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the edges present in the graph.

Looking at the edges provided:

Triangles involving Node 0: 
- (0, 4), (0, 7), (4, 7) -> <0, 4, 7>

Triangles involving Node 1: 
- (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4) -> <1, 2, 4>

Triangles involving Node 2: 
No triangles involving Node 2.

Triangles involving Node 3: 
No triangles involving Node 3.

Triangles involving Node 4: 
- (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 7) -> <3, 4, 7>

Triangles involving Node 5: 
- (4, 5), (4, 8), (5, 8) -> <4, 5, 8>

Triangles involving Node 6: 
No triangles involving Node 6.

Triangles involving Node 7: 
No triangles involving Node 7.

Triangles involving Node 8: 
No triangles involving Node 8.

Adding all the unique triangles found, there are total [4] triangles in the given graph.
