Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 2, 6>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
7. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
8. Triangle <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
