Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.

Now, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangles involving node 0: None
2. Triangles involving node 2: None
3. Triangles involving node 3: None
4. Triangles involving node 4: <4, 7, 8>
5. Triangles involving node 5: None
6. Triangles involving node 6: None
7. Triangles involving node 7: None
8. Triangles involving node 8: None
9. Triangles involving node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
