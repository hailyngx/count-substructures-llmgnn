Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles by checking for nodes that are connected in a triangular manner. 

Let's list the triangles first:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 9> 
- <0, 6, 9> 
- <2, 6, 9> 
- <4, 5, 9> 
- <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
