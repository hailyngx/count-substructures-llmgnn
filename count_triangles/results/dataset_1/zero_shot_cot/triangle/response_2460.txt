Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6.

Now, let's find the triangles:

Triangles:
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
