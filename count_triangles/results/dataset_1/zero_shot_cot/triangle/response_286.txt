Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible unique combinations of three nodes that are connected to each other.

After analyzing the given graph, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <1, 4, 6>
4. <4, 6, 9>
5. <5, 3, 6>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
