Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Each unique set of three nodes forms a triangle.

Analyzing the given graph based on the provided edges:

(0, 3, 1)
(0, 3, 7)
(1, 3, 0)
(1, 3, 7)
(2, 4, 6)
(3, 0, 7)
(3, 1, 7)
(4, 2, 6)
(5, 7, 3)
(6, 2, 4)

Therefore, based on the identified triangles above, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 0, 7>, <4, 2, 6>, <5, 7, 3>, <6, 2, 4>.
