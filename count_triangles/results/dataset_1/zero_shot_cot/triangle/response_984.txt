Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <2, 3, 5>
3. <2, 3, 8>
4. <2, 5, 8>
5. <3, 4, 8>
6. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
