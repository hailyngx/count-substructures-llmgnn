Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0: Neighbors are 4, 5, 7
   - Triangles: <0, 4, 5> and <0, 4, 7>

2. Node 2: Neighbors are 8, 9
   - No triangles

3. Node 3: Neighbors are 5, 7
   - No triangles

4. Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 6, 8, 9
   - Triangles: <0, 4, 8> and <4, 6, 8>

5. Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 7
   - No triangles

6. Node 6: Neighbors are 4, 5, 7, 8
   - No triangles

7. Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
   - Triangles: <0, 7, 8>

8. Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 4, 6, 7
   - No triangles

9. Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 4
   - No triangles

Total number of triangles in the graph: [4]
