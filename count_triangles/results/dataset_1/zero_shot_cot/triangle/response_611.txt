Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all unique triangles by considering every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

Let's start by listing the unique triangles found in the graph:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 8, 5>
<4, 1, 7>
<4, 2, 7>
<4, 9, 5>
<5, 8, 6>
<9, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
