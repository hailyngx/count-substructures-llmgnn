Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph by looking for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes. 

Observing the connections between nodes, we can find the following triangles:
1. <0, 7, 5>
2. <0, 8, 2>
3. <0, 9, 6>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <2, 4, 6>
6. <2, 6, 9>
7. <4, 6, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [7].
