Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<2, 0, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 1>
<8, 9, 4>
