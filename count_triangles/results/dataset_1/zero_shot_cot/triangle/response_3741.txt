Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for closed loops of length 3, which represent triangles. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify triangles:
- Triangles involving node 0: <0, 5, 8>
- Triangles involving node 3: <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 7>

2. Count the total number of triangles: [3]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
