Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are <1, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, and <1, 5, 9>.
