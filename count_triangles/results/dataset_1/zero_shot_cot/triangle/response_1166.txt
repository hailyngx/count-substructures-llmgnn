Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed by three nodes that are all interconnected.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <3, 1, 4>
3. <3, 2, 4>
4. <3, 4, 9>
5. <5, 4, 6>
6. <6, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
