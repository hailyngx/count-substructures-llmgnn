Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles and count them:
1. <1, 4, 8>
2. <1, 6, 8>
3. <2, 3, 6>
4. <2, 4, 9>
5. <5, 6, 7>

Count of triangles inside brackets: [5]
