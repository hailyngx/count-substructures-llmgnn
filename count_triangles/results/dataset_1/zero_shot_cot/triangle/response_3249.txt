Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's go step by step to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 3 and 7.
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 7.
4. Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 6.
5. Node 4 does not form any triangle.
6. Node 5 does not form any triangle.
7. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 3.
8. Node 7 forms triangles with nodes 8 and 9.
9. Node 8 does not form any triangle.
10. Node 9 does not form any triangle.

Now, let's list the unique triangles:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 3>
<7, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
