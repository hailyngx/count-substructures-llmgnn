Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Taking a closer look at the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 5.
- Node 1 is connected to Node 3.
- Node 2 is connected to Node 8.
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1, 4.
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 3, 6, 7.
- Node 5 is connected to Node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to Node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 4, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 2, 7.

Let's list the triangles:
1. Triangle <3, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
3. Triangle <7, 8, 4>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
