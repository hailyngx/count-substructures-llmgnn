Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. We can identify triangles by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular pattern.

Upon examining the graph, the triangles formed are as follows:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 2, 9>
<6, 3, 9>
<7, 5, 8>
<7, 5, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
