Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will check each possible combination of three nodes and see if they form a triangle by having edges between them.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 6, 8>
3. <0, 6, 3>
4. <0, 8, 5>
5. <1, 9, 2>
6. <6, 3, 9>
7. <6, 7, 8>
8. <8, 7, 6>
9. <9, 2, 3>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [9]
