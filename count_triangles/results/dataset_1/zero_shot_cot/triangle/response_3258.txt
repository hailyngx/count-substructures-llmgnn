Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's start by examining each node and its neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3.
- Node 5 is connected to node 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3.
- Node 8 is connected to node 1.

Based on the connections, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
