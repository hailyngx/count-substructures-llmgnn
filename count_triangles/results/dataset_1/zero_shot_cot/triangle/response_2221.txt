Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: From the given graph, we can see the edges between nodes. Let's find all the triangles formed by these edges.

Step 2: To form a triangle, we need three nodes connected to each other. Let's list all the unique triangles:

<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 7, 2>
<3, 6, 0>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 2, 7>
<4, 2, 5>
<4, 7, 5>
<9, 1, 3>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles. There are 10 unique triangles found in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
