Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in an adjacency list format for easier visualization:

Node 0: 4, 7, 8
Node 2: 5, 8, 9
Node 3: 4, 6, 7
Node 4: 0, 3, 8, 9
Node 5: 2, 8
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 0, 3
Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5
Node 9: 2, 4

Now, we can start counting the number of triangles by examining each possible triangle in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
2. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
