Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the graph:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 9
- Node 1: Connected to node 0
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 6, 8
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: Connected to node 4
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 5

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
