Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will list the possible triangles:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 3>
3. <0, 1, 4>
4. <0, 1, 5>
5. <0, 1, 8>
6. <1, 2, 8>
7. <1, 3, 5>
8. <1, 3, 8>
9. <1, 4, 8>
10. <1, 5, 8>
11. <2, 7, 8>
12. <3, 5, 8>

There are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
