Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step-by-step explanation of finding triangles in the given graph:
1. For each node, find all the possible edges it forms with other nodes:
   - Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9)
   - Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 6)
   - Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5)
   - Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9)
   - Node 4: (4, 9)
   - Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2)
   - Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3)
   - Node 7: (7, 3)
   - Node 8: (8, 9)
   - Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 8)

2. For each edge, check if there exists a third node that forms triangles:
   - Triangles involving node 0: <0, 3, 9>
   - Triangles involving node 1: None
   - Triangles involving node 2: None
   - Triangles involving node 3: <0, 3, 9>
   - Triangles involving node 4: None
   - Triangles involving node 5: None
   - Triangles involving node 6: None
   - Triangles involving node 7: None
   - Triangles involving node 8: None
   - Triangles involving node 9: <0, 3, 9>

3. Count the total number of unique triangles found: [<0, 3, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
