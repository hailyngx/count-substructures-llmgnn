Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 unique triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are listed below:

<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [10].
