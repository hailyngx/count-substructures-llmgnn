Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step starting with node 1:

1. Node 1 (neighbors: 5): No triangles involving node 1 as it has only one neighbor.

2. Node 2 (neighbor: 9): No triangles involving node 2 as it has only one neighbor.

3. Node 3 (neighbor: 9): No triangles involving node 3 as it has only one neighbor.

4. Node 4 (neighbors: 6, 8):
   - Triangle: <4, 6, 8>.

5. Node 5 (neighbors: 1, 6):
   - Triangle: <1, 5, 6>.

6. Node 6 (neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9):
   - Triangles: <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>.

7. Node 7 (neighbors: 6, 9):
   - No new triangles as <6, 7, 9> is already counted in step 6.

8. Node 8 (neighbors: 4, 6, 9):
   - No new triangles as <4, 6, 8> and <5, 6, 8> are already counted in steps 4 and 6.

9. Node 9 (neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8):
   - No new triangles as <5, 6, 9> and <6, 7, 9> are already counted in steps 5 and 6.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 5, and they are <4, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, and <6, 7, 9>. Hence, the answer is [5].
