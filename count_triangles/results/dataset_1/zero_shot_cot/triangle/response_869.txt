Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 2>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 8>.
