Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check for each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes. Let's go step-by-step in identifying the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {4, 5}
2. Nodes connected to node 1: {9}
3. Nodes connected to node 2: {6, 7}
4. Nodes connected to node 3: {5}
5. Nodes connected to node 4: {0, 5, 8, 9}
6. Nodes connected to node 5: {0, 3, 4}
7. Nodes connected to node 6: {2}
8. Nodes connected to node 7: {2, 8}
9. Nodes connected to node 8: {4, 7}
10. Nodes connected to node 9: {1, 4}

Next, we check for triangles:
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
