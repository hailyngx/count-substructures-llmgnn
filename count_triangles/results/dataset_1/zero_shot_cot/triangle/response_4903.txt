Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by connecting three nodes together.

Let's list all the unique triangles found in this graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 6, 7>
3. <0, 2, 6>
4. <0, 4, 6>
5. <6, 7, 8>
6. <6, 7, 4>
7. <7, 8, 6>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
