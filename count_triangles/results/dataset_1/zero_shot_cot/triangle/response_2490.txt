Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify triangles by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular manner.
2. List the unique triangles found.
3. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's go ahead and identify the triangles:

1. Triangle: <1, 2, 7>
2. Triangle: <1, 7, 9>
3. Triangle: <1, 8, 9>
4. Triangle: <2, 3, 9>
5. Triangle: <3, 4, 6>
6. Triangle: <4, 6, 8>
7. Triangle: <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
