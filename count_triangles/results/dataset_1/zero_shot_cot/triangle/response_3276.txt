Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of 3 nodes that are fully connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle: <1, 2, 7>
2. Triangle: <1, 2, 9>
3. Triangle: <1, 7, 9>
4. Triangle: <2, 6, 7>
5. Triangle: <2, 6, 9>
6. Triangle: <2, 7, 9>
7. Triangle: <3, 6, 9>
8. Triangle: <5, 6, 9>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
