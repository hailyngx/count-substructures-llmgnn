Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the number of triangles by checking for each possible triangle formed by the edges.

1. For edge (0, 2), (2, 3), there is a triangle <0, 2, 3>.
2. For edge (1, 4), there are no triangles.
3. For edge (1, 6), (6, 2), there is a triangle <1, 6, 2>.
4. For edge (1, 9), (9, 5), there is a triangle <1, 9, 5>.
5. For edge (2, 0), (0, 2), there is a triangle <2, 0, 3>.
6. For edge (2, 3), (3, 5), there is a triangle <2, 3, 5>.
7. For edge (2, 6), (6, 1), there is a triangle <2, 6, 1>.
8. For edge (3, 2), (2, 0), there is a triangle <3, 2, 0>.
9. For edge (3, 5), there are no triangles.
10. For edge (4, 1), there are no triangles.
11. For edge (5, 3), there are no triangles.
12. For edge (5, 9), there are no triangles.
13. For edge (6, 1), (1, 9), there is a triangle <6, 1, 9>.
14. For edge (6, 2), (2, 0), there is a triangle <6, 2, 0>.
15. For edge (6, 9), (9, 1), there is a triangle <6, 9, 1>.
16. For edge (7, 9), there are no triangles.
17. For edge (8, 9), there are no triangles.
18. For edge (9, 1), there are no triangles.
19. For edge (9, 5), there are no triangles.
20. For edge (9, 6), there are no triangles.
21. For edge (9, 7), there are no triangles.
22. For edge (9, 8), there are no triangles.

Step 2: List the unique triangles found.

The unique triangles are: <0, 2, 3>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 9, 5>, <2, 6, 1>, <2, 6, 0>, <6, 9, 1>.

Total number of triangles: [6]
