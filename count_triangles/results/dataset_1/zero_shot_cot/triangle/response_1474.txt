Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph.

Here is the list of unique triangles: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
