Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other. We will go through all possible combinations to find the triangles.

Let's begin the counting process step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to Node 0: {1, 2, 8}
2. Nodes connected to Node 1: {0, 9}
3. Nodes connected to Node 2: {0, 3, 6}
4. Nodes connected to Node 3: {2, 8}
5. Nodes connected to Node 4: {7}
6. Nodes connected to Node 5: {6, 8}
7. Nodes connected to Node 6: {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
8. Nodes connected to Node 7: {4, 6}
9. Nodes connected to Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 6}
10. Nodes connected to Node 9: {1, 6}

Now, we will find the triangles formed by the nodes connected to each node:

- Triangles connected to Node 0: <0, 1, 2>
- Triangles connected to Node 2: <2, 6, 0>, <2, 6, 5>, <2, 6, 8>
- Triangles connected to Node 6: <6, 5, 8>, <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
