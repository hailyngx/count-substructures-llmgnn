Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 7, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
