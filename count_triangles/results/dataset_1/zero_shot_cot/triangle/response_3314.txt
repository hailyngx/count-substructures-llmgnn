Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected.

Looking at the provided graph's edges, we can see the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <2, 1, 3>
4. <2, 3, 9>
5. <2, 6, 9>
6. <3, 8, 9>
7. <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
