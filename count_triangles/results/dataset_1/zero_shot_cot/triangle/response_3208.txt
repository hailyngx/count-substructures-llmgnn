Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will examine each node pair and check if there is a third node that is connected to both of them.

Here are the triangles identified in the given graph:
- <0, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
