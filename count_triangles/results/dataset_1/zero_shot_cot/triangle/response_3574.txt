Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Analyzing the connections in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to node 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.

Now, let's list the triangles:
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 5, 4>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <0, 9, 1>
- <0, 9, 2>
- <3, 6, 0>
- <4, 5, 0>
- <5, 7, 0>
- <5, 0, 9>
- <7, 8, 0>
- <7, 0, 9>
- <8, 2, 9>
