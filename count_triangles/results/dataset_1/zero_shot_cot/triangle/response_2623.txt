Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles within the graph based on the given edges.

Let's list the triangles present in the graph by looking at each node:

- Triangle with node 0: None
- Triangle with node 1: None
- Triangle with node 2: None
- Triangle with node 3: None
- Triangle with node 4: None
- Triangle with node 5: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle with node 6: None
- Triangle with node 7: <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle with node 8: None
- Triangle with node 9: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5> and <1, 2, 7>.
