Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can start by examining each possible triangle formed by three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 
Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:
1. Looking at the list of edges given:
- We can see that a triangle is formed when nodes are connected such as (0, 6, 7) or (2, 4, 5). 
- Let's systematically review all possible combinations of three connected nodes to identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 2, 3)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 8, 7)
   
Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 3>, and <1, 8, 7>.
