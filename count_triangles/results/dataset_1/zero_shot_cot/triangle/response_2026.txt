Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles is [5].
