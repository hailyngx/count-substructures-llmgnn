Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by determining all the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 2>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 9, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
6. Triangle <6, 8, 5>
7. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
