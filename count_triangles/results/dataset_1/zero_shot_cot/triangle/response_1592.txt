Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges to each other in a cyclic manner.

Let's list down the triangles present in the graph:

1. <1, 3, 5>
2. <1, 2, 5>
3. <1, 2, 7>
4. <1, 2, 9>
5. <1, 4, 6>
6. <1, 4, 9>
7. <1, 5, 9>
8. <2, 3, 5>
9. <2, 3, 6>
10. <2, 3, 7>
11. <2, 4, 6>
12. <2, 4, 7>
13. <2, 5, 9>
14. <3, 4, 6>
15. <3, 4, 7>
16. <3, 5, 9>
17. <4, 5, 9>
18. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [18] triangles in the given graph.
