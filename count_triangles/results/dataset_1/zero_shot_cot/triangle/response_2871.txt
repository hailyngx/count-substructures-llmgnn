Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the triangles in this graph step by step.

1. Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}

2. Edges:
   - Node 0 is connected to node 8.
   - Node 1 is connected to node 6.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
   - Node 4 is connected to node 2.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
   - Node 7 is connected to node 3.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
   - Node 9 is connected to node 6.

3. Let's identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <2, 3, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 6, 9>

4. Count and output the total number of triangles inside brackets []:
   - Total number of triangles: [2]
