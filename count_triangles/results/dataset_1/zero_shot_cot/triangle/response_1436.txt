Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 6 and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 1.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.

To find triangles, we need to find nodes that have connections to each other through a common node. Let's list the triangles below:

1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <0, 5, 1>
3. <0, 7, 1>
4. <0, 7, 2>
5. <0, 7, 5>
6. <0, 8, 6>
7. <1, 2, 5>
8. <1, 5, 7>
9. <1, 7, 2>
10. <2, 5, 7>
11. <5, 6, 7>
12. <5, 7, 6>
13. <5, 6, 9>
14. <6, 7, 3>
15. <6, 7, 9>

The total number of triangles in this graph is [15].
