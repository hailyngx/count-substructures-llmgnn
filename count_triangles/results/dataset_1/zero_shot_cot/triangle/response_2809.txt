Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every possible triangle formed by three nodes that are connected by edges. We will check for triangles by looking for nodes that are connected in a triangular manner.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
