Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the edges given. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's find and list the unique triangles:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 7, 8>
4. <0, 7, 9>
5. <0, 8, 9>
6. <4, 6, 7>
7. <5, 6, 9>
8. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles = [8]
