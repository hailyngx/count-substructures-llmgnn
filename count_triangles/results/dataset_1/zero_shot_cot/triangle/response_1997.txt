Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each triplet of nodes and see if they form a triangle by having all three possible edges.

Following is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:
- <0, 4, 7>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
