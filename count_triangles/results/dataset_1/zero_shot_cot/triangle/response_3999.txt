Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph and list them uniquely, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that are interconnected.
2. List the unique triangles found.
3. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's list the unique triangles first:
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 2 unique triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [2].
