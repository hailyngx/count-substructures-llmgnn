Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The total number of triangles is [6]. The unique triangles found are <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, and <1, 5, 9>.
