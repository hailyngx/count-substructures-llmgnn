Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. There are several methods to do this, but a straightforward approach is as follows:

1. Examine each node pair that shares a common neighbor. If there is a third edge closing the triangle, then a triangle is formed.
2. Check for unique triangles and avoid counting duplicates in our final count.

Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to node 8. They share a common neighbor (node 5), forming a triangle <0, 5, 8>.

2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to node 7. They share a common neighbor (node 5), forming a triangle <1, 5, 7>.

3. Triangles involving node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to node 5. They share a common neighbors (nodes 3 and 5). No unique triangle formed.

4. Triangles involving node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 6. They share a common neighbor (node 5), forming a triangle <3, 5, 6>.

5. Triangles involving node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to node 9. They share a common neighbor (node 5), forming a triangle <4, 5, 9>.

6. Triangles involving node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9. We have already considered the triangles involving node 2, 3, and 9. No additional unique triangles are formed.

7. Triangles involving node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to node 3. They share a common neighbor (node 5), forming a triangle <3, 5, 6>.

8. Triangles involving node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to node 1 and 5. They share a common neighbor (node 5), forming a triangle <1, 5, 7>.

9. Triangles involving node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to node 0. They share a common neighbor (node 5), forming a triangle <0, 5, 8>.

10. Triangles involving node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 5. We have already considered the triangle involving node 4. No additional unique triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
