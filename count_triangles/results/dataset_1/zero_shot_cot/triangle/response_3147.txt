Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's count the number of triangles:

1. Identify the triangles by finding nodes that are connected in a closed loop of length 3.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 6, 5>
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 1, 2>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 2, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 8, 4>
<6, 0, 1>
<6, 0, 2>
<6, 1, 4>
<6, 1, 2>
<6, 2, 4>
<8, 5, 4>
<8, 5, 0>
<8, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
