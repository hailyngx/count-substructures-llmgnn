Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we can calculate the number of triangles present. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other, creating a closed loop.

Let's find the triangles step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.

Now, let's list the unique triangles:
1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
