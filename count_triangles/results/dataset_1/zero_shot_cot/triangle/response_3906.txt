Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step to find the answer:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9. 
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 8.

Let's list down the triangles we can form:
1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <1, 5, 9>
3. <5, 6, 7>

Counting the total number of triangles in the graph, the answer is [3].
