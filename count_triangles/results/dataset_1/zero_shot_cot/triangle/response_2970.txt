Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <3, 6, 8>
3. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
