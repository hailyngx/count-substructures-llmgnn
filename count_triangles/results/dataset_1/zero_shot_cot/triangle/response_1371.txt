Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify these triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - No triangles involving node 0.

2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - Triangle <1, 2, 4>.

3. Triangles involving node 2:
   - Triangle <1, 2, 7>.

4. Triangles involving node 4:
   - Triangle <1, 4, 7>.
   - Triangle <4, 7, 9>.

5. Triangles involving node 6:
   - No triangles involving node 6.

6. Triangles involving node 7:
   - Triangle <1, 7, 2>.
   - Triangle <4, 7, 9>.

7. Triangles involving node 8:
   - No triangles involving node 8.

8. Triangles involving node 9:
   - Triangle <0, 9, 4>.
   - Triangle <9, 4, 7>.
   - Triangle <9, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
