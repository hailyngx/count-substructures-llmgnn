Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Firstly, we need to find all triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges to each other.

Step 2: Let's list all the triangles in the graph:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 1>
<3, 6, 5>
<3, 7, 5>
<4, 2, 1>
<4, 9, 7>
<5, 6, 3>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 3>
<7, 9, 4>

Step 3: Finally, let's count the number of triangles and list them:
Total number of triangles: [18]
