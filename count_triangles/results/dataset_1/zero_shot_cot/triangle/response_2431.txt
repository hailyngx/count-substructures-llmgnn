Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 triangles in the given graph. They are:

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 1, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
