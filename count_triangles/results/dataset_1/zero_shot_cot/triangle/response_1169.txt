Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 1, 9)
2. Triangle 2: (2, 7, 9)
3. Triangle 3: (3, 5, 9)
4. Triangle 4: (3, 6, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, and <3, 6, 9>.
