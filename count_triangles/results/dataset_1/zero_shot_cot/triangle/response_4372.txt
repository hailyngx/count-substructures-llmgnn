Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by the nodes.

Upon analyzing the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
1. <1, 4, 5>
2. <1, 4, 6>
3. <1, 5, 6>
4. <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
