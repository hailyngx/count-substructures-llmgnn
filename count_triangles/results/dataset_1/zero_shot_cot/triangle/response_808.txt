Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 3, and 8: <0, 3, 8>
2. Triangle involving nodes 0, 3, and 9: <0, 3, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
