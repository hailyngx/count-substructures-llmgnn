Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node -

- Node 0: degree = 2
- Node 1: degree = 4
- Node 3: degree = 5
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 5
- Node 6: degree = 4
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 4
- Node 9: degree = 4

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles using the given edges -

- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 6)
- Triangle 2: (1, 5, 7)
- Triangle 3: (1, 5, 9)
- Triangle 4: (3, 5, 7)
- Triangle 5: (4, 5, 9)
- Triangle 6: (6, 8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles are <0, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, and <6, 8, 9>.
