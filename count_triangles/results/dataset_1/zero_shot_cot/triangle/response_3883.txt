Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in a closed loop.

Let's list down the triangles first:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <0, 7, 8>
5. <7, 8, 9>

Now, calculating the total number of triangles:
