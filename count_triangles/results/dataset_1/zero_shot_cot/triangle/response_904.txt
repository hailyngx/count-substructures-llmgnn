Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the sets of three nodes that are fully interconnected with edges between each pair.

Checking all possible triangles in this graph:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <0, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
6. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
7. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
8. Triangle <3, 5, 8>
9. Triangle <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
