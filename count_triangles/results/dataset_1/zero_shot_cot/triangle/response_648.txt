Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of 3 nodes that form triangles. Since counting through the whole graph manually can be tedious, we can use the given edge information to simplify the process.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 8. Therefore, triangle <0, 6, 8> exists.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9. No triangles involving node 1 can be formed.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. Possible triangles involving node 2: <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, and <2, 6, 8>.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 7. No triangles involving node 3 can be formed.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 5. No triangles involving node 4 can be formed.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8. No triangles involving node 5 can be formed.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9. Possible triangles involving node 6: <0, 6, 1> and <6, 7, 9>.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9. No triangles involving node 7 can be formed.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5. No triangles involving node 8 can be formed.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 7. No triangles involving node 9 can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 5. So, the answer is [5].
