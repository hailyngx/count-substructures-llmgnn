Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list down the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <2, 4, 6>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the graph.
