Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify all the triangles:
   - A triangle is formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other.
   - We can identify triangles by checking each possible combination of three nodes and verifying if there is an edge between each pair of nodes.

2. List the unique triangles found:
   - We will list each unique triangle found only once inside '<>'.

Let's begin by determining the total number of triangles and listing the unique triangles: 

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 3, 2>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 4>
<8, 6, 3>
