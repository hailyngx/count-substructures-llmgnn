Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Considering the given graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, to find the total number of triangles we need to look for cycles of length 3 within the graph. 

Let's list the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <3, 4, 6>
3. <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
