Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for closed loops of length 3, which represent triangles. Let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle: <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle: <0, 4, 5>

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.
