Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are interconnected. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 0.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
