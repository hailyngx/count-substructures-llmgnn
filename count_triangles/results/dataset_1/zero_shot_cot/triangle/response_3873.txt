Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can observe all possible triangles. A triangle is formed by three nodes connected by edges such that each node is connected to the other two. Let's list down the possible triangles:

1. Triangle involving node 1: (1, 2, 4)
2. Triangle involving node 2: (2, 1, 9)
3. Triangle involving node 3: None
4. Triangle involving node 4: None
5. Triangle involving node 5: (5, 2, 9)
6. Triangle involving node 6: None
7. Triangle involving node 7: None
8. Triangle involving node 9: (9, 1, 2)

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles are <1, 2, 4>, <2, 1, 9>, <5, 2, 9>.
