Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges can be represented as follows: 

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: {(0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 9), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 7), (6, 1), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 2), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 3)}

Now, let's find the total number of triangles and list unique triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 3]
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 5, 7>
