Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify these triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
3. Triangle <1, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
5. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
6. Triangle <4, 7, 3>
7. Triangle <0, 3, 1>
8. Triangle <1, 9, 4>
9. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
10. Triangle <3, 4, 8> 

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
