Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by three nodes connected by edges. Let's start by identifying the triangles in this graph:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 1, 2>
3. <0, 1, 5>
4. <0, 6, 5>
5. <1, 5, 6>
6. <1, 5, 7>
7. <1, 6, 7>
8. <2, 0, 4>
9. <2, 3, 7>
10. <3, 7, 5>
11. <3, 7, 6>
12. <3, 8, 1>
13. <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are 13 unique triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
