Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. 

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <3, 5, 9>
5. <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
