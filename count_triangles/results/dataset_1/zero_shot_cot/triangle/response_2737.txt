Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected as triangles:
   - Triangle <1, 4, 5>
   - Triangle <4, 5, 9>

2. Count of triangles: [2]
