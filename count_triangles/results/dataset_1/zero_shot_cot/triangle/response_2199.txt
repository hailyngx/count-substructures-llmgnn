Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. 

Let's list the triangles first: 
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 3>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 7, 5>
<5, 7, 2>
<5, 7, 3>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
