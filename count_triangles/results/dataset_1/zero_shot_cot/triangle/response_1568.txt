Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique cycles of length 3, in other words, triangles. We will consider each node pair and see if there is a third node connected to both of them to form a triangle.

Looking at the provided edges, the triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 7, 9>
5. <2, 5, 8>
6. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
