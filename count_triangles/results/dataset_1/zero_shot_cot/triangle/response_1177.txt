Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's first identify all the triangles present:

1. (1, 5, 9)
2. (3, 5, 9)
3. (1, 5, 3)
4. (1, 5, 1) (This is not a valid triangle as it involves the same node twice)
5. (5, 3, 9)
6. (4, 6, 9)

So, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the output is: [6]
