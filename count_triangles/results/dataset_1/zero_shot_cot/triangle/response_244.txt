Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to node 2.
- Node 5 is connected to node 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to node 1.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 3, 1>
4. <0, 6, 1>
5. <1, 3, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
