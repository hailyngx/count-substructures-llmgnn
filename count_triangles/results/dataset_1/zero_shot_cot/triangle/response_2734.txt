Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles and list them out, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles in the graph where each triangle consists of 3 nodes connected to each other forming a closed loop.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Here are the unique triangles along with the total count:

Unique Triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [5]
