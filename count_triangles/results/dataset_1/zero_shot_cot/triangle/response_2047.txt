Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].  
The unique triangles are <0, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 8>, and <4, 5, 7>.
