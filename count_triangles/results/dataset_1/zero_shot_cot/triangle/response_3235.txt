Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all the triangles formed by checking each set of three nodes.
2. Check if there is an edge between each pair of nodes in the potential triangle.

Let's start by listing all the unique triangles:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 9, 1>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 9, 0>
<2, 4, 5>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 7>
<5, 8, 9>
<5, 9, 6>
<6, 9, 8>
<7, 8, 5>
<8, 9, 0>
<8, 9, 1>
<8, 9, 6>

Counting the total number of triangles in this graph:
