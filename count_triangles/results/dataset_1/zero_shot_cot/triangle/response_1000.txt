Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>
