Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 4, 6>
