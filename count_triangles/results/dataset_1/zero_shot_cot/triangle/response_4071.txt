Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step by step:

1. For each node, identify its neighbors based on the given edges:
   - Node 0: Neighbors are 1 and 7
   - Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 8, and 9
   - Node 2: Neighbors are 3, 5, 7, and 9
   - Node 3: Neighbors are 2, 5, and 9
   - Node 4: Neighbor is 7
   - Node 5: Neighbors are 2, 3, 7, and 9
   - Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5
   - Node 8: Neighbor is 1
   - Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, and 5

2. Check for triangles:
   - <0, 1, 8>
   - <0, 1, 9>
   - <0, 7, 2>
   - <0, 9, 1>
   - <1, 9, 2>
   - <2, 3, 5>
   - <2, 3, 9>
   - <2, 5, 9>
   - <2, 7, 5>
   - <3, 5, 9>
   - <5, 7, 2>
   - <5, 7, 9>

Thus, we have found 12 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
