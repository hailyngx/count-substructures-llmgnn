Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to both of the other two. Let's list out the unique triangles first and then count the total number of triangles.

Unique triangles:
1. <4, 5, 9>
2. <4, 6, 9>
3. <5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
