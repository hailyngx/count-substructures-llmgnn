Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Nodes with their neighbors:
   - Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7
   - Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8
   - Node 2: 1, 9
   - Node 3: 0, 1, 8
   - Node 4: 7
   - Node 5: 0, 1, 7
   - Node 7: 0, 4, 5
   - Node 8: 1, 3, 9
   - Node 9: 2, 8

2. Counting triangles:
   - Possible triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>
   - Possible triangles involving node 1: <1, 0, 3>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 0, 7>
   - No triangles involving node 2
   - Possible triangles involving node 3: <3, 0, 1>
   - No triangles involving node 4
   - No triangles involving node 5
   - Possible triangles involving node 7: <7, 0, 5>
   - No triangles involving node 8
   - No triangles involving node 9

3. Total number of triangles: [4] 
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
