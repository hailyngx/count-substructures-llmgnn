Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Count the triangles using the given graph structure.
    
    1. Look for nodes that have common neighbors.
    2. Count the triangles formed by these nodes.

Here is the list of triangles found in the given graph:
    
    1. <1, 2, 4>
    2. <2, 3, 7>
    3. <6, 7, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [3]
