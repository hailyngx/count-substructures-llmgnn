Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected by edges. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
