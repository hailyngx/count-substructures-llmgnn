Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph
- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 3)
- Triangle 2: (0, 1, 4)
- Triangle 3: (0, 6, 8)
- Triangle 4: (1, 3, 0)
- Triangle 5: (1, 4, 0)
- Triangle 6: (1, 7, 8)
- Triangle 7: (1, 9, 0)

Step 2: Count the number of unique triangles
- Total number of triangles: 7
