Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each possible triangle formed by nodes.

1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
4. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
5. Triangle <1, 2, 9>
6. Triangle <5, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <5, 8, 9>
8. Triangle <6, 9, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
