Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go through the graph and identify the triangles:

1. Triangle formed by nodes 0, 1, and 2: <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle formed by nodes 1, 3, and 7: <1, 3, 7>
3. Triangle formed by nodes 2, 4, and 6: <2, 4, 6>
4. Triangle formed by nodes 3, 4, and 9: <3, 4, 9>
5. Triangle formed by nodes 6, 7, and 8: <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
