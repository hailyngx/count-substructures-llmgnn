Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by finding the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Look at each node and find its neighbors:
   - Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
   - Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
   - Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 7
   - Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4
   - Node 4: Neighbor is 3
   - Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 1, 6, 9
   - Node 6: Neighbors are 5, 8
   - Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2
   - Node 8: Neighbor is 6
   - Node 9: Neighbor is 5

2. Find triangles:
   - Possible triangles involving each node:
     - Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 7)
     - Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 7)
     - Node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 3), (2, 0, 7)
     - Node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 0, 2)
     - Node 5: (5, 0, 1)
   - Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 3>

The total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
