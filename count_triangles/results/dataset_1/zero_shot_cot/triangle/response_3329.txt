Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Looking at the given edges, let's find all the possible triangles by checking for nodes that are connected to each other through edges:

- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 5)
- Triangle 2: (0, 2, 8)
- Triangle 3: (0, 4, 7)
- Triangle 4: (2, 1, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, and <2, 1, 8>.
