Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify triangles by finding nodes that have edges connecting them in a way that creates a triangle.

1. Triangle with nodes (0, 1, 2)
2. Triangle with nodes (0, 1, 4)
3. Triangle with nodes (0, 2, 5)
4. Triangle with nodes (1, 2, 5)
5. Triangle with nodes (4, 8, 9)
6. Triangle with nodes (5, 7, 9)

Step 2: List the unique triangles found:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
