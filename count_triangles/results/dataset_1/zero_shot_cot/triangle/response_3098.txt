Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each combination of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle. 

The triangles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
