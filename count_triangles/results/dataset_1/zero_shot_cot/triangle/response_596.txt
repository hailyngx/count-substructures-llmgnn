Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's go step by step to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Identify the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 6, 8>
- Triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 6, 5>
- Triangle <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle <5, 7, 8>

2. Count the total number of triangles: [5]
