Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's list all the triangles first:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <1, 7, 8>
3. <6, 8, 9>

Now count the total number of triangles: [3]
