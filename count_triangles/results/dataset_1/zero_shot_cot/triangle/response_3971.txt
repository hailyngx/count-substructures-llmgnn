Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles present in the graph:
1. (0, 8, 1)
2. (1, 3, 5)
3. (1, 8, 0)
4. (1, 8, 7)
5. (1, 8, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
