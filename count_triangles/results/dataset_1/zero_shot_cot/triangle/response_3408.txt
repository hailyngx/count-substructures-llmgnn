Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are completely interconnected by edges.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 1, 3>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
7. Triangle <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
