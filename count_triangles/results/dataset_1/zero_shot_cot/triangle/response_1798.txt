Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By examining the edges in the graph, we can identify the triangles as follows:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle 2: <3, 5, 8>
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
