Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to search for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list all the triangles found in this graph:

1. <2, 7, 5>
2. <2, 5, 4>
3. <2, 5, 7>
4. <2, 5, 9>
5. <2, 7, 9>
6. <4, 3, 5>
7. <4, 3, 9>
8. <4, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
