Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique triangles formed by three nodes connected by edges.

Let's first list all possible triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 4>
6. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
7. Triangle <4, 6, 9>
8. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
