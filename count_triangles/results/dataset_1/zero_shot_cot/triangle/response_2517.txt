Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 5.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 8, and 9.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 2: <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle 3: <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle 4: <3, 5, 6>
- Triangle 5: <5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
