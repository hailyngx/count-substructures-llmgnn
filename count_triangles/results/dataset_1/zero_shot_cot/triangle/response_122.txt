Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected with edges. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Nodes directly connected to each other:
- <0, 1>
- <0, 2>
- <0, 3>
- <0, 4>
- <1, 2>
- <2, 5>
- <2, 6>
- <3, 4>
- <3, 8>
- <4, 5>
- <4, 7>
- <5, 8>
- <6, 9>
- <7, 8>

2. Now, we need to find triangles formed by three nodes:
- <0, 1, 2> (Triangle)
- <0, 3, 4> (Triangle)
- <2, 4, 5> (Triangle)
- <2, 5, 8> (Triangle)

After examining the graph, we see that there are 4 unique triangles present. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
