Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each possible triangle formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when we have three nodes connected by edges, creating a closed loop.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 3, 5>
<5, 6, 9>
<8, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
