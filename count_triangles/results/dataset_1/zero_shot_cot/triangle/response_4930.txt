Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list the triangles step by step. 

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
   - <0, 1, 7>
   - <0, 2, 7>
   - <0, 3, 5>
   - <0, 5, 7>
   - <0, 7, 8>

2. Nodes connected to node 1: {0, 7, 8}
   - <1, 0, 7>
   - <1, 7, 8>

3. Nodes connected to node 2: {0, 7}
   - <2, 0, 7>

4. Nodes connected to node 3: {0, 5}
   - <3, 0, 5>

5. Nodes connected to node 4: {5, 7, 8}
   - No triangles with node 4.

6. Nodes connected to node 5: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
   - <5, 0, 7>
   - <5, 0, 3>
   - <5, 3, 4>
   - <5, 4, 7>
   - <5, 5, 7>

7. Nodes connected to node 6: {5, 7}
   - No triangles with node 6.

8. Nodes connected to node 7: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
   - <7, 0, 1>
   - <7, 0, 2>
   - <7, 0, 5>
   - <7, 1, 8>
   - <7, 2, 4>
   - <7, 2, 5>
   - <7, 4, 5>
   - <7, 5, 6>
   - <7, 5, 7>
   - <7, 7, 8>

9. Nodes connected to node 8: {0, 1, 4}
   - No triangles with node 8.

10. Nodes connected to node 9: {5}
   - No triangles with node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
