Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to count the number of triangles:

1. Look for triangles formed by nodes connected directly with each other:
   - Triangle 1: Nodes (0, 2, 7)
   - Triangle 2: Nodes (1, 5, 6)
   - Triangle 3: Nodes (2, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 4: Nodes (4, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 5: Nodes (2, 4, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 8>, and <2, 4, 9>.
