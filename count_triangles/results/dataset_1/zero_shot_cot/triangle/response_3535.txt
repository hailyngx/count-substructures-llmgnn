Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles found:
<[0, 2, 8]>
<[2, 4, 6]>
<[2, 6, 8]>
<[1, 5, 6]>
<[2, 6, 7]>
<[4, 8, 9]>

So, the total number of triangles is [6].
