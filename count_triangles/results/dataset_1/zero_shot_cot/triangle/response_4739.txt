Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. Here are the triangles present in the graph:

Triangles:
1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <1, 4, 9>
4. <1, 5, 7>
5. <2, 5, 6>
6. <3, 5, 7>
7. <5, 7, 8>
8. <6, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
