Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles by checking for nodes that form triangles together:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
