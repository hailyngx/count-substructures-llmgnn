Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the triangles in this graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to each other:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
   - Node 1 is connected to node 7.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 8, and 9.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
   - Node 6 is connected to node 0.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.

2. Find the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 3, and 4 form a triangle.
   - Triangle 2: Nodes 3, 4, and 8 form a triangle.
   - Triangle 3: Nodes 3, 4, and 9 form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 8>, and <3, 4, 9>.
