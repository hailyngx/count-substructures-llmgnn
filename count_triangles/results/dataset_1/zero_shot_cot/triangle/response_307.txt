Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
