Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After examining the given edges and nodes, we can list the unique triangles as follows:
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
