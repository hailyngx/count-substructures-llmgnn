Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each possible triangle formed by the nodes and see if all three edges exist. 

Let's denote the nodes as 0, 1, 2, ..., 9. The triangles in this graph are:

1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 2, 8>
4. <0, 3, 6>
5. <0, 3, 8>
6. <2, 3, 6>
7. <2, 3, 7>
8. <2, 3, 8>
9. <3, 6, 8>
10. <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
