Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph.
For a triangle to exist, there should be three nodes connected to each other forming a closed loop.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <1, 4, 7>
2. <1, 7, 9>
3. <2, 3, 7>
4. <3, 4, 7>
5. <6, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles.
The total number of triangles is [5].
