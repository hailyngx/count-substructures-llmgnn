Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes.

Here is the list of unique triangles in the graph:
<0, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 9>

As there are 2 unique triangles in the graph, the total number of triangles is [2].
