Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify the unique triangles present. A triangle exists when three nodes are connected to each other. 

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 1>
<8, 0, 4>
<8, 0, 3>
<8, 3, 2>

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
