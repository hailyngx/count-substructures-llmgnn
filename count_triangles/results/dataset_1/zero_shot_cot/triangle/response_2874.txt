Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for unique sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. We will go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
2. Node 1: Connected to node 9.
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 7 and 9.
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 0 and 9.
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 4 and 5.
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.

Now, we identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle 4: <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle 5: <4, 7, 9>
- Triangle 6: <5, 6, 9>
  
Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
