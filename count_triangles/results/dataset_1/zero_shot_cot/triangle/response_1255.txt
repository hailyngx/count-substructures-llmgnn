Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Check the common neighbors of each pair of nodes:
   - Nodes 0 and 2 have the common neighbors 4 and 8.
   - Nodes 0 and 4 have the common neighbor 2.
   - Nodes 0 and 8 have the common neighbor 2.
   - Nodes 0 and 9 have no common neighbors.
   - Nodes 2 and 4 have no common neighbors.
   - Nodes 2 and 5 have no common neighbors.
   - Nodes 2 and 7 have no common neighbors.
   - Nodes 2 and 8 have no common neighbors.
   - Nodes 2 and 9 have no common neighbors.
   - Nodes 3 and 6 have no common neighbors.
   - Nodes 3 and 9 have no common neighbors.
   - Nodes 4 and 5 have no common neighbors.
   - Nodes 5 and 7 have the common neighbor 2.
   - Nodes 6 and 7 have no common neighbors.
   - Nodes 6 and 9 have no common neighbors.
   - Nodes 7 and 8 have no common neighbors.
   - Nodes 7 and 9 have no common neighbors.
   - Nodes 8 and 9 have no common neighbors.

2. Count the number of triangles:
   - There is one triangle <0, 2, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
