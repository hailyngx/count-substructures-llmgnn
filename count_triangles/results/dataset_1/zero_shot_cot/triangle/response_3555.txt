Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find all possible triangles in the given graph:
1. Check for each node whether they form a triangle with other two nodes connected by edges.
   
Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <3, 7, 8>
3. <3, 7, 9>
4. <4, 5, 6>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <5, 6, 7>
7. <7, 8, 3>

Total number of triangles: [7]
