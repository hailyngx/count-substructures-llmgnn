Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's go step-by-step:

1. From the given edges, we identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 2, 3)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 4, 3)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 4: (2, 0, 3)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 3, 5)
   - Triangle 6: (3, 4, 1)
   - Triangle 7: (6, 1, 4)
   - Triangle 8: (6, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 9: (6, 8, 1)
   - Triangle 10: (7, 6, 1)
   - Triangle 11: (7, 8, 1)
   - Triangle 12: (7, 8, 6)
   - Triangle 13: (8, 6, 1)
   - Triangle 14: (8, 6, 7)

2. Counting the number of unique triangles, we have:
   - [14 triangles] in total, which are: 
   - <0, 2, 3>
   - <1, 4, 3>
   - <1, 6, 8>
   - <2, 0, 3>
   - <2, 3, 5>
   - <3, 4, 1>
   - <6, 1, 4>
   - <6, 7, 8>
   - <6, 8, 1>
   - <7, 6, 1>
   - <7, 8, 1>
   - <7, 8, 6>
   - <8, 6, 1>
   - <8, 6, 7>
