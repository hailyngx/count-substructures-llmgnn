Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. To count the number of triangles, we need to find all the unique triangles formed by the nodes in the graph. 

Let's list the unique triangles first:
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<8, 9, 3>
<8, 9, 5>

Counting the number of total triangles: [7]
