Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Starting with node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9. 
   - Looking at the connections among these nodes: (1, 3) and (1, 6) form a triangle with node 0. So, the triangle is <0, 1, 3>.
  
2. Analyzing node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9.
   - Among these, we have already found the triangle <0, 1, 3>.
   - There is no additional triangle involving node 1.

3. Moving on to node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
   - There is no new triangle with node 2.

4. Moving to node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6.
   - No triangle can be formed with node 3.

5. Analyzing node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
   - No triangle can be formed with node 4.

6. Moving on to node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 9.
   - The triangle <0, 1, 5> can be formed.

7. Analyzing node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5.
   - The triangle <0, 2, 6> can be formed.

8. Moving on to node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 9.
   - No triangle can be formed with node 7.

9. Analyzing node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
   - No triangle can be formed with node 8.

10. Moving to node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7.
    - The triangle <0, 1, 9> can be formed.

In total, there are 3 unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, and <0, 2, 6>. So the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
