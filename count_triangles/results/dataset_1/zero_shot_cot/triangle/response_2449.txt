Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in this graph step by step:
1. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 9: <0, 1, 9>.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, and 5: <0, 1, 3> and <1, 3, 5>.
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 5: <2, 4, 5>.
4. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 7: <2, 4, 7>.
5. Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 6: <1, 5, 6>.
6. Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9: <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, and <6, 8, 9>.
7. Node 8 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 9: <6, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
