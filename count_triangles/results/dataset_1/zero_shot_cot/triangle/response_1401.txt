Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can go through each possible triangle formed by three nodes and check if there are edges connecting all three nodes.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 4, 5>
4. <1, 2, 6>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <2, 4, 7>
7. <3, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
