Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9. Therefore, triangle <0, 3, 4> is formed.
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8. Therefore, triangles <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, and <0, 3, 8> are formed.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8. Therefore, triangle <0, 4, 8> is formed.
4. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6. Therefore, triangle <3, 4, 8> is formed.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
