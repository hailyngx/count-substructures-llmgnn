Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 0.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 0.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.

Now, let's list the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
