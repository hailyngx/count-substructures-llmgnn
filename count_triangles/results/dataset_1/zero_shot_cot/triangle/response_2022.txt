Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each unique set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Below are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <4, 5, 7>
5. <4, 6, 9>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the output is [5].
