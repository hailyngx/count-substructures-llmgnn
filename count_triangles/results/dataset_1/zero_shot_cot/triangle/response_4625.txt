Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to identify all the triangles that exist based on the provided edges.

Let's denote the nodes as follows for easier reference:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's list all the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <1, 2, 5>
3. <2, 3, 7>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <2, 8, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
