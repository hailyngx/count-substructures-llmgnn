Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other (i.e., form a triangle).

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 6.

From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 1>
2. <0, 2, 3>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <0, 3, 7>
5. <0, 4, 7>
6. <0, 6, 9>
7. <1, 2, 3>
8. <3, 4, 7>
9. <4, 6, 9>
10. <4, 7, 5>
11. <6, 9, 5>
12. <7, 5, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
