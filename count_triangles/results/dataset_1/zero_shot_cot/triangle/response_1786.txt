Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's count the number of triangles.

1. Identify the triangles: A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

2. By examining the edges provided, we find the following triangles: <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 8, 9>.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
