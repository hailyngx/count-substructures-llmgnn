Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can determine the number of triangles present by examining the triangles formed by every set of three connected nodes.

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 4>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
