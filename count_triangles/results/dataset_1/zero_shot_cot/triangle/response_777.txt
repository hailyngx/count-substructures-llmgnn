Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we will look for nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

The unique triangles found in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<3, 9, 5>

After checking all possible combinations, we found a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
