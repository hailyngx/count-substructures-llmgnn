Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <3, 1, 4>
- <3, 2, 8>
- <4, 1, 3>
- <4, 1, 6>
- <4, 3, 9>
- <6, 0, 4>
- <6, 0, 7>
- <9, 3, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph.
