Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Nodes connected to node 1: [3, 4]
2. Nodes connected to node 2: [4, 6, 8]
3. Nodes connected to node 3: [1, 6, 7]
4. Nodes connected to node 4: [1, 2, 9]
5. Nodes connected to node 5: [7, 8, 9]
6. Nodes connected to node 6: [2, 3, 9]
7. Nodes connected to node 7: [3, 5, 9]
8. Nodes connected to node 8: [2, 5, 9]
9. Nodes connected to node 9: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Now, let's identify the triangles present in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <1, 3, 4>
- Triangle 2: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 3: <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle 4: <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle 5: <5, 7, 9>
- Triangle 6: <5, 8, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles in the graph, we have found 6 unique triangles. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
