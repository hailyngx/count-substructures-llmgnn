Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for nodes that together form a triangle (i.e., three nodes that are all interconnected).

Initially, let's list down all the unique triangles present in the graph:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 6>
<6, 5, 9>

Now, counting the total number of triangles formed by these unique triplets, we get a total of **[7]** triangles in the given graph.
