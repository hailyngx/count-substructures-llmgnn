Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected in such a way that they form a triangle.
Once we list all the triangles, we can count the total number of unique triangles. Here are the triangles found in this graph:
1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <4, 2, 8>
5. <7, 3, 1>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
