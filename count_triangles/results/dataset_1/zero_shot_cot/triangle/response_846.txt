Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Now, let's find the triangles in this graph by checking for nodes that have common neighbors:
- Triangle 1: <0, 7, 8>
- Triangle 2: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 3: <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle 4: <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
