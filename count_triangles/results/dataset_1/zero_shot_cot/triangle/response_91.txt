Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

To find a triangle, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <1, 2, 9>
2. <2, 6, 7>

Count of triangles: [2]
