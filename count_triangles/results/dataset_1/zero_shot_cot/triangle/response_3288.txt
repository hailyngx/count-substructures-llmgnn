Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's identify those triangles step by step:

1. Triangles involving node 0:
   - <0, 3, 9>

2. Triangles involving node 1:
   - No triangle is formed involving node 1.

3. Triangles involving node 2:
   - No triangle is formed involving node 2.

4. Triangles involving node 3:
   - No triangle is formed involving node 3.

5. Triangles involving node 4:
   - No triangle is formed involving node 4.

6. Triangles involving node 5:
   - No triangle is formed involving node 5.

7. Triangles involving node 6:
   - <4, 6, 7>
   - <6, 7, 9>

8. Triangles involving node 7:
   - No additional triangle is formed involving node 7.

9. Triangles involving node 8:
   - No triangle is formed involving node 8.

10. Triangles involving node 9:
   - No additional triangle is formed involving node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, and <6, 7, 9>.
