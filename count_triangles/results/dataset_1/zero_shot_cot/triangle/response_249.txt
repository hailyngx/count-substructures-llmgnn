Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 5, 3>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 2>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 7, 3>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 7, 3>
7. Triangle <3, 5, 8>
8. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
9. Triangle <3, 7, 9>
10. Triangle <5, 8, 9>
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
