Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify triangles in the graph
- To form a triangle, we need three nodes connected by edges to each other. 
- Let's go node by node to see which triangles are present in the graph:

Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 6)
     - Triangle: There is no triangle involving Node 0.

Node 1: (1, 7)
     - Triangle: There is no triangle involving Node 1.

Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 9)
     - Triangle: <0, 2, 9>

Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9)
     - Triangle: There is no triangle involving Node 3.

Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9)
     - Triangle: There is no triangle involving Node 4.

Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 9)
     - Triangle: There is no triangle involving Node 5.

Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 4)
     - Triangle: There is no triangle involving Node 6.

Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 9)
     - Triangle: There is no triangle involving Node 7.

Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 9)
     - Triangle: There is no triangle involving Node 8.

Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 8)
     - Triangle: There is no triangle involving Node 9.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of triangles
- Counting the unique triangle found: <0, 2, 9>
- Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [1]
