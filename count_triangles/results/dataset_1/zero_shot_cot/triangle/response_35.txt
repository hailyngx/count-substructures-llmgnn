Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other, which is a common way to define a triangle in a graph.

Let's list down the triangles found in this graph:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <1, 4, 3>
4. <1, 5, 7>
5. <7, 8, 0>
6. <2, 4, 3>
7. <2, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
