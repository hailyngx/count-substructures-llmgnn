Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
- First, let's identify all the triangles in the graph. To form a triangle, we need three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list them: 

Triangles:
1. <2, 7, 8>
2. <4, 5, 7>
3. <5, 7, 9>

- Now, let's count the total number of triangles [3].
