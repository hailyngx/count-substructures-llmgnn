Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Count the total number of triangles by calculating the number of triangles connected to each node.
    - Node 0: (0, 2, 6), (0, 6, 9) -> 2 triangles
    - Node 1: No triangles
    - Node 2: (2, 0, 6), (2, 6, 7) -> 2 triangles
    - Node 4: (4, 1, 6), (4, 6, 9) -> 2 triangles
    - Node 5: No triangles
    - Node 6: (6, 0, 2), (6, 2, 4), (6, 4, 7) -> 3 triangles
    - Node 7: No triangles
    - Node 8: No triangles
    - Node 9: (9, 0, 4), (9, 4, 5), (9, 5, 8) -> 3 triangles

Step 2: Calculate the total number of unique triangles.
    - Unique triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 4>, <9, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 3 [ <0, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 4>, <9, 5, 8>].
