Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles by checking if nodes are interconnected:
- Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 1, 5 form a triangle.
- Triangle 2: Nodes 0, 3, 6 form a triangle.
- Triangle 3: Nodes 0, 4, 7 form a triangle.
- Triangle 4: Nodes 0, 7, 9 form a triangle.
- Triangle 5: Nodes 3, 6, 7 form a triangle.
- Triangle 6: Nodes 4, 7, 8 form a triangle.
- Triangle 7: Nodes 5, 6, 8 form a triangle.

Hence, there are 7 triangles in total in the given graph. Therefore, the output is [7]. The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 6, 8>.
