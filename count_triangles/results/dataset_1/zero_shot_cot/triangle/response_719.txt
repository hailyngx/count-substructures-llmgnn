Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for 3-node cycles. Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph.

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<6, 7, 8>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
