Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we first need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges given. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle 2: <2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
