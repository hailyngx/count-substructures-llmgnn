Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we need to search for all possible triangles formed by the edges. Here are the triangles identified:

1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 5, 6>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <2, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
