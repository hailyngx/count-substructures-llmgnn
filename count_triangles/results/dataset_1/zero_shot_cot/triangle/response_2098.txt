Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each set of three nodes that are all connected with each other. Let's go through the list of edges to find the triangles:

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <0, 4, 5>
4. <3, 4, 8>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <3, 7, 8>
7. <3, 7, 9>
8. <4, 8, 9>
9. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
