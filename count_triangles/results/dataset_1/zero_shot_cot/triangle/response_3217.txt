Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the triangles in the given graph:

- Looking at the edges, we see that there is a triangle involving nodes 0, 1, and 7: <0, 1, 7>.
- Another triangle is formed by nodes 1, 4, and 5: <1, 4, 5>.
- There is a triangle with nodes 1, 7, and 9: <1, 7, 9>.
- The last triangle in this graph is made up of nodes 5, 7, and 9: <5, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [4].
