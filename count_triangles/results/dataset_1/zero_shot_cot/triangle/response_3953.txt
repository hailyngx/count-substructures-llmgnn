Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each possible set of three nodes and check if they form a triangle.

1. Start by listing out all the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 5, 9>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 5, 9>
   - Triangle 3: <2, 4, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <2, 4, 7>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 7, 3>
   - Triangle 6: <4, 8, 5>

2. Now, count the total number of triangles: 
   - Total number of triangles = [6]

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
