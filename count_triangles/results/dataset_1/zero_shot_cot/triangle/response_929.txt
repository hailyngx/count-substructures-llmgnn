Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles by finding all nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular form.
2. Count and list the unique triangles found.

Let's start listing the unique triangles:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
- Triangle 2: <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle 4: <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle 5: <4, 7, 8>

Counting the total number of triangles: [5]
