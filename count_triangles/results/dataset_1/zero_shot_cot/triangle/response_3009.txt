Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can analyze the connections between the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's calculate it step-by-step.
  
1. Check each node to see which nodes it is connected to:
   - Node 1: Connected to Node 2
   - Node 2: Connected to Nodes 1, 3, 7, 9
   - Node 3: Connected to Nodes 2, 5, 6, 7
   - Node 5: Connected to Nodes 3, 6, 9
   - Node 6: Connected to Nodes 3, 5, 8
   - Node 7: Connected to Nodes 2, 3
   - Node 8: Connected to Node 6
   - Node 9: Connected to Nodes 2, 5
   
2. Based on the connections, we can identify the triangles:
   - <2, 3, 7>
   - <2, 3, 9>
   - <3, 5, 6>
   
Therefore, the graph has a total of [3] triangles.
