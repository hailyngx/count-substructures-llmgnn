Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

Here are the unique triangles in the graph:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [11]
