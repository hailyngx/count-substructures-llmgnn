Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Triangle involving node 0:
   - (0, 2), (0, 8), (2, 8) --> <0, 2, 8>

2. Triangle involving node 1:
   - (1, 6), (1, 7), (6, 7) --> <1, 6, 7>

3. Triangle involving node 8:
   - (1, 8), (1, 7), (7, 8) --> <1, 7, 8>
   - (0, 8), (0, 9), (8, 9) --> <0, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
