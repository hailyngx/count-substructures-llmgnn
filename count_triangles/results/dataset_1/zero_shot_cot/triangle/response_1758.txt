Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Triangles involving Node 0:
   - No triangle involves Node 0, as it is only connected to Node 5.

2. Triangles involving Node 1:
   - No triangle involves Node 1.

3. Triangles involving Node 2:
   - No triangle involves Node 2.

4. Triangles involving Node 3:
   - Triangle <1, 3, 6>

5. Triangles involving Node 5:
   - Triangle <0, 5, 2>
   - Triangle <1, 5, 6>

6. Triangles involving Node 6:
   - Triangle <1, 3, 6>
   - Triangle <3, 6, 5>
   - Triangle <5, 6, 1>

7. Triangles involving Node 7:
   - No triangle involves Node 7.

8. Triangles involving Node 8:
   - No triangle involves Node 8.

9. Triangles involving Node 9:
   - No triangle involves Node 9.

By listing the triangles found above, we can see that the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles are <1, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 6>, and <3, 6, 5>.
