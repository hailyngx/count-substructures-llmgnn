Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in a cyclic manner. Let's start by listing the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 6, 1>
2. <0, 6, 4>
3. <0, 7, 2>
4. <0, 8, 3>
5. <2, 3, 9>
6. <2, 4, 6>
7. <2, 7, 0>
8. <2, 5, 8>
9. <3, 8, 5>
10. <6, 1, 8>

There are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
