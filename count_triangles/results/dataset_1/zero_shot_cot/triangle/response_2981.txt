Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will check each possible triangle formed by nodes and determine if all three edges are present. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
