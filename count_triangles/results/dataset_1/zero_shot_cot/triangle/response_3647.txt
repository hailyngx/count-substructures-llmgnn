Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Count the triangles passing through each node as the middle point.
    - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 2)  
    - Triangle 2: (0, 2, 4)  
    - Triangle 3: (0, 4, 8)  
    - Triangle 4: (1, 0, 7)  
    - Triangle 5: (2, 0, 4)  
    - Triangle 6: (2, 4, 7)  
    - Triangle 7: (4, 0, 8)  
    - Triangle 8: (4, 2, 7)  
    - Triangle 9: (7, 1, 2)  
    - Triangle 10: (7, 2, 4)  
    - Triangle 11: (7, 4, 5)  
    - Triangle 12: (8, 0, 3)  
    - Triangle 13: (8, 3, 4)  
    
Step 2: Add up the total number of unique triangles.
    - Total number of unique triangles: [13]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
