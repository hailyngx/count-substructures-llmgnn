Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. In this case, let's go step by step:

1. Starting with node 0, we find that it forms triangles with nodes 1 and 6. So, the triangle <0, 1, 6> is found.

2. Continuing with node 1, we can see that it forms triangles with nodes 0 and 8. So, the triangle <0, 1, 8> is found.

3. From node 2, we find the triangle <2, 3, 4>.

4. Node 3 also forms the triangle <2, 3, 4>.

5. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 8, which we already counted.

6. Node 5 forms the triangle <2, 5, 6>.

7. For node 6, we have already counted its triangles with nodes 0 and 1.

8. Node 7 doesn't form any triangles.

9. Node 8 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 4, which we already counted.

10. Node 9 forms two triangles: <1, 9, 2> and <5, 9, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
