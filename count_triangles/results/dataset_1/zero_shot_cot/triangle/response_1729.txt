Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
  
1. Identify all triangles by finding nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular manner.
2. Count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's go step by step:
1. The nodes connected in a triangular manner are:
   - (0, 1, 2)
   - (1, 4, 6)
   - (1, 6, 8)
  
2. There are a total of 3 unique triangles found in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
