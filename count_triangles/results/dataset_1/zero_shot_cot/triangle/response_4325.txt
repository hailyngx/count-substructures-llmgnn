Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify groups of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go through the nodes and list the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
