Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the triangles in the given graph. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
7. Node 7 is connected to node 3.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.

Now, we can identify the triangles by visually checking for nodes that are interconnected.

Triangles:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <3, 4, 8>
4. <3, 6, 8>

Based on the identified triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
