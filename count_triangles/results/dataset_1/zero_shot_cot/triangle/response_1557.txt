Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Given the provided edges, we can list the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <3, 4, 9>
3. <1, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
