Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's analyze the given graph's connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 6.
- Node 4 is connected to node 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to node 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.

Now, let's list the unique triangles:
1. <0, 2, 8>

Count of triangles: [1]
