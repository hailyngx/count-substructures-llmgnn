Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Firstly, let's identify all the triangles in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: Nodes (5, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 2: Nodes (5, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 3: Nodes (5, 6, 9)
   - Triangle 4: Nodes (5, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 5: Nodes (5, 7, 9)
   - Triangle 6: Nodes (5, 8, 9)
   - Triangle 7: Nodes (6, 7, 9)

2. Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [7] 

The total number of triangles in the graph is 7. The unique triangles found are:
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
