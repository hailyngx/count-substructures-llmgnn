Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected with each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. First, let's list out all triangles present in the graph:
   - (0, 1, 4)
   - (0, 3, 7)
   - (3, 5, 6)
   - (5, 6, 9)
   
2. Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles. There are 4 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
