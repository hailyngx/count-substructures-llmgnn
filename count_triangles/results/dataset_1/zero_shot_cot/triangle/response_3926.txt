Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify possible triangles using the given edges.
- For a triangle to exist, we need three nodes connected by edges to each other. 
- We can identify possible triangles by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular manner.

Step 2: List the possible triangles using the given edges:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <2, 5, 3>
3. Triangle <2, 7, 4>
4. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <2, 9, 3>
6. Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique triangles:
- There are 6 unique triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
