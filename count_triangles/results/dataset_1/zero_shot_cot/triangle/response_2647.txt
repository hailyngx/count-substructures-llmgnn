Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Let's find the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
   - <0, 5, 1>
   - <0, 8, 1>
   - <0, 9, 4>
   - <2, 3, 5>
   - <2, 6, 7>
   - <2, 7, 8>
   - <2, 7, 9>
   - <2, 8, 9>
   - <3, 5, 1>
   - <8, 7, 9>

2. Counting the total number of unique triangles found gives us 10 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
