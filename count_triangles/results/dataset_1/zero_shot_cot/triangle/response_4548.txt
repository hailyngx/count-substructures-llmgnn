Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is a set of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the set.

Let's list the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <1, 7, 9>
5. <4, 6, 8>
6. <7, 9, 3>

So, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
