Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes such that each node is connected to the other two nodes. Let's identify and count the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 2, 7)
2. Triangle 2: (2, 4, 7)
3. Triangle 3: (4, 5, 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, and <4, 5, 6>.
