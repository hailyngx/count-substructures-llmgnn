Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Upon analyzing the graph, we can find the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <1, 3, 5>
4. <1, 3, 8>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <3, 4, 5>
7. <3, 4, 6>
8. <3, 4, 8>
9. <4, 5, 6>
10. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
