Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles formed by the nodes and the connections between them. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in such a way that each node is connected to the other two.

Let's consider the nodes and their connections:

Node 0: Connected to node 5. (0, 5)
Node 1: Connected to node 4. (1, 4)
Node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9. (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 9)
Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8. (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8)
Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4. (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4)
Node 6: Connected to nodes 4 and 9. (6, 4), (6, 9)
Node 8: Connected to nodes 2 and 4. (8, 2), (8, 4)
Node 9: Connected to nodes 2 and 6. (9, 2), (9, 6)

Now, we will identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
3. Triangle <4, 8, 2>
4. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 9, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
