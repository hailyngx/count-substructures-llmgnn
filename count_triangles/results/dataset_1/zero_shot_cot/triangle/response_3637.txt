Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will determine the triangles by looking for nodes that form a closed loop of edges.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
2. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
3. Triangle <5, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <5, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
