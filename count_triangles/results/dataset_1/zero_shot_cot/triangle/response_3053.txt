Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for closed loops of length 3 which indicate the presence of a triangle in the graph. We will simply count the number of triangles formed by checking each possible combination of three nodes.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 2>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
