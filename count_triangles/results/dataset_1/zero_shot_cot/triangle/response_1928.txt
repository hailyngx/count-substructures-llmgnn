Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's identify all possible triangles by examining each triplet of nodes connected by edges.

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
1. <1, 4, 5>
2. <1, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
