Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the edges provided, we can visualize the connections between the nodes to determine the triangles. The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Here is the representation of the graph followed by the triangles found:

Graph:
- 0: 6, 7, 8
- 1: 4, 9
- 2: 3, 6
- 3: 2, 5
- 4: 1, 5, 7
- 5: 3, 4
- 6: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9
- 7: 0, 4, 6
- 8: 0, 6
- 9: 1, 6

Triangles:
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <2, 6, 7>  [3 unique triangles found]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
