Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the possible triangles formed by the given edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes have connections between each other. Let's go through the nodes and edges to find the triangles:

1. Nodes 0, 1, and 6 form a triangle <0, 1, 6>.
2. Nodes 1, 2, and 7 form a triangle <1, 2, 7>.
3. Nodes 1, 6, and 9 form a triangle <1, 6, 9>.
4. Nodes 2, 4, and 8 form a triangle <2, 4, 8>.
5. Nodes 2, 7, and 6 form a triangle <2, 7, 6>.
6. Nodes 4, 5, and 6 form a triangle <4, 5, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
