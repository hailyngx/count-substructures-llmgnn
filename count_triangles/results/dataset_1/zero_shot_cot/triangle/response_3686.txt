Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to check every possible combination of three nodes and see if there is an edge between each pair of nodes. Let's start by listing all the triangles:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <2, 6, 8>
3. <3, 6, 9>
4. <4, 6, 9>
5. <4, 6, 8>
6. <4, 6, 7>
7. <4, 7, 9>
8. <6, 8, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
