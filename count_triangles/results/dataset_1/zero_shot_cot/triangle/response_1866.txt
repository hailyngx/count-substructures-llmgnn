Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

To form a triangle, we need three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will search for every set of three nodes that form a triangle.

After analyzing the provided graph, the triangles found are:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <1, 8, 4>
3. <1, 6, 9>
4. <1, 7, 5>
5. <3, 4, 8>
6. <3, 9, 6>
7. <8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
