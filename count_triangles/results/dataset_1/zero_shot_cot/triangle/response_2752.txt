Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph step by step:

1. Looking at the edges, we can identify the following triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 1, 6>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 1, 7>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
