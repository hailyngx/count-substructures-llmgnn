Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in a closed loop.

Let's identify the triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Identify the nodes connected by edges:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 5
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 9
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 9
   - Node 6 is connected to node 1
   - Node 7 is connected to node 9
   - Node 8 is connected to node 2
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7

2. Identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (1, 2, 4)
   - Triangle 2: (2, 5, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 4> and <2, 5, 9>.
