Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 6>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
