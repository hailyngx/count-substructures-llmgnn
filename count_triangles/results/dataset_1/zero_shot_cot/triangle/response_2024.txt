Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is 3. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 8> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
