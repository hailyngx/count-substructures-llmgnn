Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each unique set of three nodes that form a triangle.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 7, 9>

Count of triangles: [2]
