Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Identifying triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 4, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
4. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <0, 6, 3>
6. Triangle <1, 2, 5>

Total number of triangles: [6]
