Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other, creating a closed loop.

Let's start by listing all the unique triangles we can find in the graph:
<0, 2, 3>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
