Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every possible combination of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 6, 2>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 6>
6. Triangle <2, 6, 4>
7. Triangle <5, 9, 2>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
