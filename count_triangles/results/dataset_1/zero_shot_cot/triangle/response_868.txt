Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
1. Letâ€™s start by listing out all possible triangles using the given edges:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 4, 6)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 4, 8)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 4, 9)
   - Triangle 4: (0, 6, 9)
   - Triangle 5: (1, 5, 8)
   - Triangle 6: (1, 5, 3)
   - Triangle 7: (1, 6, 2)
   - Triangle 8: (2, 6, 4)
   - Triangle 9: (2, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 10: (3, 5, 8)
   - Triangle 11: (4, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 12: (4, 7, 9)
   - Triangle 13: (4, 8, 5)
   - Triangle 14: (4, 8, 9)
   - Triangle 15: (6, 7, 9)
   - Triangle 16: (8, 5, 9)

2. Now, let's count the number of triangles by checking which of these triangles have all three edges present in the given edges.

3. The total number of triangles found is [3] inside brackets.

4. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, and <4, 6, 9>.
