Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Given the edges in the graph, we can identify the triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After analyzing the graph, the triangles and their corresponding nodes are as follows:
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
