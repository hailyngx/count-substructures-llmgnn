Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 5, 3>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <2, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
