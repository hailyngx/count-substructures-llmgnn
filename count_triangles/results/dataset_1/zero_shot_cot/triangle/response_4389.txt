Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 3, 1>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 4, 1>
4. <0, 4, 9>
5. <3, 1, 4>
6. <3, 1, 7>
7. <3, 6, 0>
8. <3, 6, 2>
9. <4, 1, 7>
10. <4, 8, 9>
11. <7, 1, 5>
12. <7, 8, 9>

There are **12 triangles** in total. Therefore, the answer is **[12]**.
