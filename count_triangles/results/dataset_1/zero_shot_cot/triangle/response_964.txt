Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's calculate the total number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 9. A triangle is formed with nodes 0, 2, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8. No triangle is formed.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6. No new triangle is formed.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 7. No triangle is formed.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Triangles are formed with nodes (2, 4, 5), (4, 6, 5), and (4, 7, 9).
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6. No new triangle is formed.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5. No new triangle is formed.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9. Triangles are formed with nodes (1, 7, 8) and (7, 4, 9).
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 7. No triangle is formed.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7. No new triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **[5]**. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
- <0, 2, 9>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <4, 6, 5>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <1, 7, 8>
