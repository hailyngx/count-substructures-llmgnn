Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: For a triangle to exist, we need 3 nodes connected to each other. Let's list the possible triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 1, 2)
- Triangle 2: (0, 2, 7)
- Triangle 3: (1, 0, 3)
- Triangle 4: (1, 3, 5)
- Triangle 5: (2, 0, 7)
- Triangle 6: (2, 4, 7)
- Triangle 7: (3, 1, 5)
- Triangle 8: (3, 5, 8)
- Triangle 9: (4, 2, 7)
- Triangle 10: (7, 0, 2)
- Triangle 11: (7, 4, 8)

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles found:
- Total number of triangles = 11

[Total number of triangles: 11]
