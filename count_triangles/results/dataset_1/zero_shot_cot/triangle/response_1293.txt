Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Going through the list of edges:

1. <0, 2, 9>
2. <1, 4, 7>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <1, 7, 8>
5. <2, 6, 9>
6. <3, 4, 7>
7. <3, 4, 8>
8. <3, 7, 8>
9. <3, 7, 5>
10. <6, 7, 9>
11. <1, 6, 7>
12. <2, 6, 7>
13. <2, 3, 8>
14. <2, 8, 9>
15. <3, 8, 9>
16. <4, 7, 8>
17. <9, 6, 9>
18. <9, 8, 1>
19. <9, 1, 4>
20. <9, 1, 7>

Total number of triangles: [20]
