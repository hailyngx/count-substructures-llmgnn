Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle: <0, 1, 5>
3. Triangle: <1, 6, 7>
4. Triangle: <2, 7, 9>
5. Triangle: <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
