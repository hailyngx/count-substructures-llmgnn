Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can determine the number of triangles by identifying sets of nodes that form triangles. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 6, and 8.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 9.
3. Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 1, 6, and 8.
4. Node 4 forms triangles with nodes 1, 8, and 9.
5. Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, and 6.
6. Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, and 5.
7. Node 8 forms triangles with nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9.
8. Node 9 forms triangles with nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's list the unique triangles:

<0, 1, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 8>

There are 5 unique triangles in total, so the answer is [5].
