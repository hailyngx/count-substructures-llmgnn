Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Nodes 1, 2, and 6 form a triangle.
2. Nodes 1, 4, and 5 form a triangle.
3. Nodes 1, 6, and 4 form a triangle.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, and <1, 4, 6>.
