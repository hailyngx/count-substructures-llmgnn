Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

From the given edge list, we can identify the triangles:
1. Nodes 0, 5, 1 form a triangle <0, 5, 1>.
2. Nodes 5, 2, 4 form a triangle <5, 2, 4>.
3. Nodes 2, 8, 5 form a triangle <2, 8, 5>.
4. Nodes 2, 9, 4 form a triangle <2, 9, 4>.
5. Nodes 7, 9, 2 form a triangle <7, 9, 2>.
6. Nodes 7, 9, 4 form a triangle <7, 9, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
