Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Check for triangles involving each node:
- Node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 5, 6), (0, 6, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 5, 6)
- Node 2: No triangles
- Node 3: No triangles
- Node 4: No triangles
- Node 5: No additional triangles
- Node 6: No additional triangles
- Node 7: No additional triangles
- Node 8: No triangles
- Node 9: No triangles

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = 3

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 7>.
