Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Identify the triangles:
   - From the given edges, we can list the triangles:
     - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
     - Triangle 2: <2, 3, 8>
     - Triangle 3: <3, 5, 4>
     - Triangle 4: <2, 5, 8>
     - Triangle 5: <5, 7, 9>

2. Count the total number of triangles: 
   - Total number of triangles = 5

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
