Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's analyze the graph to find all the triangles:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: 2, 8, 9
2. Nodes connected to node 2: 0
3. Nodes connected to node 3: 6, 8, 9
4. Nodes connected to node 4: 6, 9
5. Nodes connected to node 5: 7
6. Nodes connected to node 6: 3, 4, 8
7. Nodes connected to node 7: 5, 9
8. Nodes connected to node 8: 0, 3, 6
9. Nodes connected to node 9: 0, 3, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 8, 9>
- Triangle 4: <3, 6, 8>
- Triangle 5: <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle 6: <3, 8, 9>
- Triangle 7: <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle 8: <7, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
