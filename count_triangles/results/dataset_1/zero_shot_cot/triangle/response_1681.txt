Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, and <6, 8, 9>.
