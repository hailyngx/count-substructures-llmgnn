Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find all the triangles in the graph:

- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 6)
- Triangle 2: (0, 2, 9)
- Triangle 3: (1, 2, 8)
- Triangle 4: (2, 7, 9)
- Triangle 5: (3, 6, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [5].
