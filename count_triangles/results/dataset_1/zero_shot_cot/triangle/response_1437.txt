Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

1. Nodes {1, 2, 3} form a triangle.
2. Nodes {1, 3, 7} form a triangle.
3. Nodes {1, 7, 8} form a triangle.
4. Nodes {3, 4, 7} form a triangle.
5. Nodes {4, 6, 7} form a triangle.
6. Nodes {6, 7, 8} form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
