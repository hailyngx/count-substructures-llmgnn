Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's examine each possible triangle:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <2, 7, 3>
3. Triangle <8, 9, 8>  (Note: This triangle includes a self-loop edge from node 8 to itself)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
