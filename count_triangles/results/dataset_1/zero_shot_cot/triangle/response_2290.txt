Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the connected nodes. Let's walk through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify Triangles**:
    - Triangles are formed when there are three nodes connected to each other in the graph.
    - Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the following triangles:
        - <0, 2, 5>
        - <2, 4, 5>
        - <4, 6, 9>
        - <4, 7, 9>
        - <4, 8, 9>
        - <5, 7, 9>
        - <5, 8, 9>

2. **Count the Total Number of Triangles**:
    - The total number of triangles in this graph is [**7**].

Therefore, the answer is [7].
