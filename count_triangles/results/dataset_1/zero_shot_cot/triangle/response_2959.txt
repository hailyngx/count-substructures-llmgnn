Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 8>.
