Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each possible triangle formed by three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly or indirectly. Here are the triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <1, 4, 5>
5. <4, 5, 9>
6. <5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
