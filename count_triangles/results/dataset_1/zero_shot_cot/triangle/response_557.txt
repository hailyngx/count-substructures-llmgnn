Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

Let's start by listing the triangles one by one:
1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <2, 3, 7>
5. <3, 4, 5>
6. <3, 4, 9>
7. <3, 5, 9>
8. <4, 5, 9>
9. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. Hence, the total number of triangles is [9].
