Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges. A triangle consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the triangle.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Looking at node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
   - By checking the connections between these nodes, we find that there is a triangle formed by nodes 0, 2, and 4: <0, 2, 4>.

2. Moving on to node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
   - There are no triangles involving node 1 in this graph.

3. Analyzing node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 8.
   - By checking the connections between these nodes, we find another triangle: <0, 2, 4>.

4. Examining node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
   - There is no triangle involving node 3 in this graph.

5. Continuing with node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
   - We have already counted the triangle involving node 4 when analyzing nodes 0 and 2.

6. Focusing on node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
   - There is no triangle involving node 5 in this graph.

7. Looking at node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
   - There is no triangle involving node 6 in this graph.

8. Investigating node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6.
   - There are no additional triangles involving node 8 in this graph.

9. Examining node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
   - There is no triangle involving node 9 in this graph.

After analyzing each node, we find that there are 2 unique triangles in the given graph: <0, 2, 4> and <0, 2, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
