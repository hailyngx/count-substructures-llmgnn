Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 6, 4>
2. <0, 6, 5>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <0, 8, 5>
5. <0, 8, 7>
6. <0, 9, 1>
7. <0, 9, 3>
8. <1, 9, 3>
9. <2, 3, 5>
10. <2, 3, 7>
11. <2, 7, 5>
12. <3, 5, 7>
13. <3, 5, 9>
14. <4, 6, 5>
15. <4, 6, 9>
16. <5, 7, 8>
17. <5, 7, 6>
18. <6, 9, 4>
19. <7, 8, 5>
20. <9, 4, 6>
21. <9, 1, 3>

Total number of triangles: [21]
