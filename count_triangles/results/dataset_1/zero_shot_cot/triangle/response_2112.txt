Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all possible triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are pairwise connected. Let's go step-by-step to determine the total number of triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 3.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 7.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 8.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, and 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 7.
9. Node 9 is connected to node 0.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <2, 3, 7>
- Triangle 2: <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
