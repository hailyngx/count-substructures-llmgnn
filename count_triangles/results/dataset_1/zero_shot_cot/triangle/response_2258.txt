Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected in a way that forms a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other forming a closed loop. 

Let's list the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <1, 7, 9>
4. <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
