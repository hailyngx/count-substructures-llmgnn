Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of triangles in this graph, we can look for each triangle formed by three connected nodes.

Let's find the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 8, 4>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
4. Triangle <2, 8, 4>
5. Triangle <3, 9, 7>
6. Triangle <3, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
