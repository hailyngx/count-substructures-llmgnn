Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible combinations of three nodes that form a closed triangle. Here's how we can count the number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
   - Connected to: 2, 4, 5, 9
   - Triangles possible: <0, 2, 4>

2. Node 1:
   - Connected to: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
   - Triangles possible: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 8, 9>

3. Node 2:
   - Connected to: 0, 1, 3, 9
   - Triangles possible: <2, 0, 1>

4. Node 4:
   - Connected to: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
   - Triangles possible: <4, 0, 1>, <4, 5, 8>

5. Node 5:
   - Connected to: 0, 4, 6
   - Triangles possible: <5, 0, 4>, <5, 4, 6>

6. Node 6:
   - Connected to: 1, 5
   - Triangles possible: <6, 1, 5>

7. Node 7:
   - Connected to: 4

8. Node 8:
   - Connected to: 1, 4
   - Triangles possible: <8, 1, 4>

9. Node 9:
   - Connected to: 0, 1, 2
   - Triangles possible: <9, 0, 2>, <9, 1, 2>

Therefore, the unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 5>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 0, 4>, <5, 4, 6>, <6, 1, 5>, <8, 1, 4>, <9, 0, 2>, <9, 1, 2>.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
