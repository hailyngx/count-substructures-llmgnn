Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 0.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 0.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:
1. Triangles involving Node 0: <0, 4, 8>.
2. Triangles involving Node 1: None.
3. Triangles involving Node 2: None.
4. Triangles involving Node 3: None.
5. Triangles involving Node 4: <4, 7, 9>.
6. Triangles involving Node 5: None.
7. Triangles involving Node 6: None.
8. Triangles involving Node 7: None.
9. Triangles involving Node 8: None.
10. Triangles involving Node 9: None.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
