Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected to each other.

Given the provided edges, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
\[<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 7>\]

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
