Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each unique combination of three nodes that form a triangle. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Starting with node 0:
   - Triangles involving node 0: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 6, 7>

2. Moving on to node 2:
   - Triangles involving node 2: <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 7>

3. Next, node 3:
   - Triangles involving node 3: <0, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <5, 3, 9>

4. Moving to node 4:
   - Triangles involving node 4: <0, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 4>, <4, 6, 7>

5. Proceeding to node 5:
   - Triangles involving node 5: <3, 5, 9>

6. Moving on to node 6:
   - Triangles involving node 6: <0, 3, 6>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>

7. Next, node 7:
   - Triangles involving node 7: <0, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>

8. Proceeding to node 8:
   - Triangles involving node 8: <3, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>

9. Lastly, node 9:
   - Triangles involving node 9: <3, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
