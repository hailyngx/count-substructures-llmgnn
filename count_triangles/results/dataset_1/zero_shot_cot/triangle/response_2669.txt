Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 2.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 1.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.

Let's identify the triangles:
- Triangles involving node 0: None
- Triangles involving node 1: None
- Triangles involving node 2: (0, 1, 2)
- Triangles involving node 3: None
- Triangles involving node 4: None
- Triangles involving node 5: (2, 5, 7), (5, 6, 9)
- Triangles involving node 6: (2, 6, 7), (2, 6, 9), (5, 6, 7), (5, 6, 9)
- Triangles involving node 7: None
- Triangles involving node 8: None
- Triangles involving node 9: None

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6] which are <0, 1, 2>, <2, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 7>.
