Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the given graph:
1. (0, 7, 3)
2. (0, 7, 9)
3. (0, 9, 1)
4. (1, 3, 7)
5. (1, 3, 9)
6. (1, 6, 2)
7. (1, 6, 9)
8. (3, 7, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
