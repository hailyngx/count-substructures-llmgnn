Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 6.
3. Node 3 is connected to node 4 and 8.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
6. Node 8 is connected to node 3.
7. Node 9 is connected to node 0.

From the connections listed, we can see there are two triangles in the graph:
1. Nodes <0, 4, 3>
2. Nodes <0, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
