Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected by edges. 

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 8, 1>
4. <0, 9, 1>
5. <1, 3, 6>
6. <1, 3, 8>
7. <1, 3, 9>
8. <1, 5, 9>
9. <3, 4, 6>
10. <3, 4, 8>
11. <4, 6, 8>
12. <4, 6, 7>
13. <4, 8, 6>
14. <5, 7, 9>
15. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.
