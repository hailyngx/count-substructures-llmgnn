Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph by checking each set of three nodes whether they form a triangle by having all three pairwise connections. 
Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <2, 5, 7>
2. <2, 7, 8>
3. <3, 4, 8>
4. <0, 5, 6>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <2, 8, 9>
7. <0, 6, 7>
8. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
