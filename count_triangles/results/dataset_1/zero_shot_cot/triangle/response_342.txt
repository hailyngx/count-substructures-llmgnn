Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's analyze the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
4. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 8, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
7. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
8. Triangle <5, 8, 9>
9. Triangle <0, 1, 2> (This triangle was not explicitly mentioned in the edges but it is there based on the given edges)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
