Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 1.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.

Now, we can identify the triangles based on the connections:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle 2: <2, 4, 9>
3. Triangle 3: <3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
