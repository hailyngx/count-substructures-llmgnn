Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. By examining the given edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph:

- Triangle <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle <6, 8, 9>

2. Count the total number of triangles: [8]

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
