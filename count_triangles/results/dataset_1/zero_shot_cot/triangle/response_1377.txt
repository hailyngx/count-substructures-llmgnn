Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph and list the unique triangles, we can follow these steps:

1. Analyze the connections between nodes to identify triangles.
2. Count all the unique triangles.

Here are the unique triangles in the graph along with the total count:

Unique triangles: 
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 1>
<3, 7, 0>
<3, 0, 6>
<4, 6, 0>
<8, 6, 9>
<8, 6, 2>

Total number of triangles: [9]
