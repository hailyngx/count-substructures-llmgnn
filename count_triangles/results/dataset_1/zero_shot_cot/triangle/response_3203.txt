Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Look for nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

2. Count the triangles:

- Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 1, 5
- Triangle 2: Nodes 0, 4, 5
- Triangle 3: Nodes 0, 2, 5
- Triangle 4: Nodes 0, 1, 6
- Triangle 5: Nodes 0, 2, 6
- Triangle 6: Nodes 1, 3, 9
- Triangle 7: Nodes 1, 8, 9
- Triangle 8: Nodes 2, 4, 8
- Triangle 9: Nodes 2, 3, 8
- Triangle 10: Nodes 2, 3, 9
- Triangle 11: Nodes 2, 4, 9
- Triangle 12: Nodes 3, 8, 9

So, there are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [12].
