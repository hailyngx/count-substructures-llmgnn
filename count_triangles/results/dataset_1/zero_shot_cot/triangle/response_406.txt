Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <2, 4, 7>, <1, 9, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, and <2, 3, 4>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
