Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Finding triangles in a graph involves finding sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the steps to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Based on the given edges, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle consists of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

2. Enumerate all possible triangles and check if each triangle is present in the graph.

3. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

Let's start by identifying the triangles based on the given edges:  

The triangles in the graph are:  

1. <0, 3, 6>  
2. <0, 3, 9>  
3. <0, 6, 9>  
4. <3, 4, 8>  
5. <3, 4, 9>  
6. <3, 6, 4>  
7. <3, 6, 8>  
8. <4, 6, 8>  
9. <4, 6, 9>  
10. <4, 8, 9>  
11. <7, 8, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
