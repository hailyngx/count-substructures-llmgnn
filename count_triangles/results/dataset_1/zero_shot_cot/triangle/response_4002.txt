Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's identify each triangle and then count the total number of triangles at the end.

1. Triangles involving node 0:
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 3, 8>

2. Triangles involving node 1:
- No triangles with node 1.

3. Triangles involving node 2:
- No triangles with node 2.

4. Triangles involving node 3:
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <5, 3, 6>
- <6, 3, 7>

5. Triangles involving node 5:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <5, 6, 7>

6. Triangles involving node 6:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <5, 6, 7>

7. Triangles involving node 7:
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <5, 6, 7>

8. Triangles involving node 8:
- No triangles with node 8.

9. Triangles involving node 9:
- No triangles with node 9.

After identifying all unique triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
