Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's start by listing all the triangles we can find:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 2, 8>
4. <0, 6, 8>
5. <2, 4, 9>
6. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
