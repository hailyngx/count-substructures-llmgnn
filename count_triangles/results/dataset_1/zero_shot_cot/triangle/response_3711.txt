Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 4, 5, and 8.
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 7.
4. Node 3 forms a triangle with node 8.
5. Node 4 forms a triangle with node 9.
6. Node 5 forms a triangle with node 2.
7. Node 6 forms a triangle with node 8.
8. Node 7 forms a triangle with node 2.
9. Node 8 forms a triangle with node 9.

So, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
