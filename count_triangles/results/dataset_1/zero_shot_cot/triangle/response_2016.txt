Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. In a triangle, each node is connected to the other two nodes within the same triangle.

Here are the unique triangles in the given graph:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Counting the number of triangles, we find that there are [6] triangles in total.
