Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all triplets of nodes that are connected to each other. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <1, 3, 7>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <3, 4, 7>
6. <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
