Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Look for each possible triangle in the graph by checking every set of three nodes that are interconnected.
2. Count the total number of triangles.

Now, let's list the unique triangles found and count the total number of triangles:

Unique triangles found:
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [9]
