Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>
2. Triangle <4, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
4. Triangle <8, 6, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
