Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <1, 5, 7>
4. <1, 8, 9>
5. <2, 4, 5>
6. <2, 5, 7>
7. <2, 4, 8>
8. <3, 4, 5>
9. <3, 8, 9>
10. <4, 6, 8>
11. <4, 5, 6>
12. <8, 6, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
