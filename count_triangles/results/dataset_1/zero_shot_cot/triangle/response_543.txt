Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step to identify and count the triangles:

1. Start by listing all the possible triangles using the given edges:

Possible triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, k>, <0, 2, k>, <0, 5, k>, <0, 7, k>
Possible triangles involving node 1: <1, 9, k>
Possible triangles involving node 2: <2, 3, k>
Possible triangles involving node 3: <3, 5, k>, <3, 6, k>
Possible triangles involving node 4: <4, 6, k>, <4, 8, k>, <4, 9, k>
Possible triangles involving node 5: <5, 3, k>
Possible triangles involving node 6: <6, 7, k>
Possible triangles involving node 7: <7, 9, k>
Possible triangles involving node 8: <8, 9, k>
Possible triangles involving node 9: None

2. Next, identify the unique triangles from the list above:

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 8, 9>

3. Count the total number of unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [7]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 7.
