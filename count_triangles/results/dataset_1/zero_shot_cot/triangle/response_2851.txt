Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's look for each possible triangle in the graph and list them:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 6>
5. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
7. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
8. Triangle <4, 5, 7>
9. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
10. Triangle <7, 6, 0>

There are a total of 10 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
