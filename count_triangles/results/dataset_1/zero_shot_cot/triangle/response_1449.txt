Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 6, 7>
2. <1, 2, 4>
3. <2, 4, 1>
4. <2, 4, 2>
5. <2, 4, 2>
6. <2, 6, 3>
7. <3, 6, 9>
8. <6, 0, 7>
9. <6, 0, 7>
10. <6, 0, 7>
11. <6, 2, 1>
12. <6, 2, 1>
13. <6, 2, 1>
14. <6, 2, 4>
15. <6, 2, 4>
16. <6, 2, 4>
17. <6, 2, 8>
18. <6, 2, 8>
19. <6, 2, 8>
20. <6, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [20] triangles in the given graph.
