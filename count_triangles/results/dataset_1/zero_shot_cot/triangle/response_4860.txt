Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify triangles by looking for cycles of length 3. A cycle of length 3 in a graph corresponds to a triangle.

Here are the triangles present in the given graph:
1. <0, 5, 2>
2. <0, 5, 4>
3. <1, 4, 9>
4. <2, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in total in the given graph. So the output is [4].
