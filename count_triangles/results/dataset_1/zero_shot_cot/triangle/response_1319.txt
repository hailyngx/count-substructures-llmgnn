Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
By counting triangles in the given graph step-by-step, we can identify the total number of triangles it contains. Let's break it down:

1. Node 0: Triangles involving node 0 can be formed by considering its connections to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
   - Triangles: <0, 4, 9>

2. Node 1: Triangles involving node 1 can be formed by considering its connections to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9.
   - Triangles: <1, 4, 9>

3. Node 2: Triangles involving node 2 can be formed by considering its connections to nodes 5 and 8.
   - No triangles involving node 2.

4. Node 3: Triangles involving node 3 can be formed by considering its connection to node 8.
   - No triangles involving node 3.

5. Node 4: Triangles involving node 4 can be formed by considering its connections to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9.
   - No additional unique triangles involving node 4 since <0, 4, 9> and <1, 4, 9> were already counted.

6. Node 5: Triangles involving node 5 can be formed by considering its connections to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
   - No triangles involving node 5.

7. Node 6: Triangles involving node 6 can be formed by considering its connections to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
   - No triangles involving node 6.

8. Node 7: Triangles involving node 7 can be formed by considering its connection to node 0.
   - No triangles involving node 7.

9. Node 8: Triangles involving node 8 can be formed by considering its connection to node 2 and 3.
   - No triangles involving node 8.

10. Node 9: Triangles involving node 9 can be formed by considering its connections to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
   - No additional unique triangles involving node 9 since <0, 4, 9> and <1, 4, 9> were already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles are <0, 4, 9> and <1, 4, 9>.
