Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Upon examining the graph and the provided edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to node 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <0, 4, 9>
5. <2, 4, 6>
6. <2, 4, 9>
7. <2, 6, 9>

Hence, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
