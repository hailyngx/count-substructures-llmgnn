Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we can look for all the triangles formed by the three nodes connected by edges. We can identify these triangles systematically:

1. Start with each node: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
2. For each node, check if there are edges connecting pairs of its neighbors.
3. If there is a triangle with all three nodes connected, count it as a triangle.

Here are the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 5, 3>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 2, 3>
5. <1, 3, 8>
6. <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
