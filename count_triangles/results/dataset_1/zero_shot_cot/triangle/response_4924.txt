Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
4. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
6. Triangle <4, 7, 1>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
8. Triangle <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
