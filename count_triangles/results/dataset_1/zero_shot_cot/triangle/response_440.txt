Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when there are three nodes connected by edges to form a closed loop.

Upon examining the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <2, 3, 8>
5. <3, 4, 5>
6. <5, 6, 1>
7. <5, 6, 7>
8. <8, 9, 3>
9. <8, 0, 5>
   
From the identified triangles, we can see that there are 9 unique triangles in total. Therefore, the output would be:
[9]
