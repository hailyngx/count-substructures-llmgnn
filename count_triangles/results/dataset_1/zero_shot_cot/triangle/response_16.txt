Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we can determine the number of triangles present. Here's the breakdown:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8.

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 8)
- Triangle 2: (0, 2, 9)
- Triangle 3: (0, 6, 9)
- Triangle 4: (0, 8, 9)
- Triangle 5: (2, 5, 8)
- Triangle 6: (2, 8, 9)
- Triangle 7: (4, 5, 9)
- Triangle 8: (4, 7, 8)
- Triangle 9: (4, 8, 9)

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in total. Hence, the final answer is: [9]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 8>, and <4, 8, 9>.
