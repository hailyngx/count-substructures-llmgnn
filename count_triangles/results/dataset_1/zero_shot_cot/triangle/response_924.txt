Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find all triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
2. Triangle <1, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
8. Triangle <7, 6, 8>
9. Triangle <8, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 triangles in the given graph. So the answer is [9].
