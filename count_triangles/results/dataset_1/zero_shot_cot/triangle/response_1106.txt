Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, let's first identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
4. Triangle <0, 3, 9>

There are 4 triangles in total in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
