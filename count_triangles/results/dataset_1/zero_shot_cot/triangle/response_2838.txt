Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to each other forming a closed loop of edges.

In this graph, the triangles are:
1. <0, 5, 8>
2. <2, 7, 8>
3. <2, 8, 9>
4. <2, 3, 5>
5. <2, 3, 9>
6. <3, 5, 6>
7. <3, 6, 7>
8. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in total. So, the output is [8].
