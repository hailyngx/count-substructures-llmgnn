Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <1, 5, 6>
5. <1, 5, 9>
6. <1, 6, 9>
7. <3, 4, 8>
8. <5, 6, 9>
9. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
