Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we can look for triangles by checking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a triangular manner.

Based on the given edges, the triangles can be formed using the following combinations:
1. (0, 8, 9)
2. (1, 3, 9)
3. (1, 5, 6)
4. (1, 6, 7)
5. (1, 7, 9)
6. (2, 6, 9)
7. (6, 7, 9)
8. (8, 9, 0)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **[8]**. The unique triangles found are:

<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
