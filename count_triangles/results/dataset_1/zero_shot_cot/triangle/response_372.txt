Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that form a triangle. In a triangle, each node is connected to the other two nodes. Let's enumerate the triangles below:

1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <1, 2, 6>
5. <6, 4, 0>
6. <8, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
