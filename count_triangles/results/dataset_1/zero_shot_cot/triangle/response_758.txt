Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step:

1. Find all triangles:
   - Triangle <1, 3, 9>
   - Triangle <1, 3, 4>
   - Triangle <1, 4, 9>

2. Output the total number of triangles: [3]
