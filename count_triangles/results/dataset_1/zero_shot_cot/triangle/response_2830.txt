Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each set of three nodes to see if they form a triangle. Let's list the triangles step by step:

1. Triangles with node 0:
- Triangle <0, 8, 9>

2. Triangles with node 1:
- No triangles can be formed with node 1.

3. Triangles with node 2:
- Triangle <2, 8, 9>

4. Triangles with node 4:
- No triangles can be formed with node 4.

5. Triangles with node 5:
- No triangles can be formed with node 5.

6. Triangles with node 6:
- No triangles can be formed with node 6.

7. Triangles with node 8:
- Triangle <0, 8, 6>
- Triangle <2, 8, 6>
- Triangle <8, 0, 9>

8. Triangles with node 9:
- Triangle <0, 8, 9>
- Triangle <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are: <0, 8, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <0, 8, 6>, and <8, 0, 9>.
