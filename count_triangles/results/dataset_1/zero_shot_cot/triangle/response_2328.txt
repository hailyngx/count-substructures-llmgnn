Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Check for each node to see if there is a triangle formed.
- Triangle involving node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 6, 8), (0, 7, 9)
- Triangle involving node 1: (1, 0, 3), (1, 2, 3), (1, 0, 6)
- Triangle involving node 2: (2, 1, 3)
- Triangle involving node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 2, 1), (3, 0, 6)
- Triangle involving node 4: None
- Triangle involving node 5: (5, 8, 9)
- Triangle involving node 6: None
- Triangle involving node 7: None
- Triangle involving node 8: None
- Triangle involving node 9: (9, 0, 7), (9, 4, 5)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.
- Total number of triangles = 3 (triangles involving node 0) + 3 (triangles involving node 1) + 1 (triangle involving node 2) + 3 (triangles involving node 3) + 1 (triangle involving node 5) + 2 (triangles involving node 9) = 13

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <5, 8, 9>, <9, 4, 5>.
