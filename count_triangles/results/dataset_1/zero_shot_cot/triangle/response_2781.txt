Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the edges given in the graph.

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
6. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
7. Triangle <3, 8, 9>
8. Triangle <3, 1, 6>
9. Triangle <3, 1, 7>
10. Triangle <3, 6, 8>
11. Triangle <4, 2, 7>
12. Triangle <5, 7, 9>
13. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
