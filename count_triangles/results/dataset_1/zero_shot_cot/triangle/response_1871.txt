Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the triangles in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 4
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8
- Node 1 is connected to node 2
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 9
- Node 3 is connected to node 9
- Node 8 is connected to node 4
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 7

Now, let's list the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <2, 7, 9>

So, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
