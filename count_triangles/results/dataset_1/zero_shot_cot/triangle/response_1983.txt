Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the triangles in the given graph by identifying unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Looking at the edges provided, we can see the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 2, 7>
4. <0, 2, 9>
5. <0, 6, 7>
6. <0, 6, 9>
7. <0, 7, 9>
8. <2, 3, 4>
9. <3, 4, 7>
10. <4, 1, 7>
11. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
