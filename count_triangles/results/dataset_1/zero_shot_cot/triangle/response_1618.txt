Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 5, 3>
4. <0, 5, 9>
5. <0, 9, 3>
6. <3, 5, 9>
7. <1, 6, 4>
8. <1, 6, 8>
9. <1, 8, 7>
10. <1, 8, 9>
11. <8, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
