Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find all triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges to form a closed loop.

From the given edges, the possible triangles are as follows:
1. (0, 6, 4)
2. (0, 6, 1)
3. (0, 6, 5)
4. (0, 7, 4)
5. (0, 7, 3)
6. (0, 7, 9)
7. (0, 9, 1)
8. (0, 9, 3)
9. (1, 4, 6)
10. (1, 4, 7)
11. (1, 6, 5)
12. (1, 6, 0)
13. (1, 6, 4)
14. (1, 6, 7)
15. (1, 6, 9)
16. (1, 9, 7)
17. (2, 1, 3)
18. (3, 7, 0)
19. (3, 7, 4)
20. (3, 7, 9)
21. (3, 9, 0)
22. (3, 9, 1)
23. (3, 9, 7)
24. (4, 6, 0)
25. (4, 6, 1)
26. (4, 7, 0)
27. (4, 7, 3)
28. (4, 7, 9)
29. (5, 6, 0)
30. (6, 0, 7)
31. (6, 0, 4)
32. (6, 1, 4)
33. (6, 1, 7)
34. (6, 1, 9)
35. (6, 4, 7)
36. (6, 5, 0)
37. (7, 0, 9)
38. (7, 3, 9)
39. (7, 4, 1)
40. (7, 4, 3)
41. (7, 4, 6)
42. (9, 0, 1)
43. (9, 0, 3)
44. (9, 1, 6)
45. (9, 1, 7)
46. (9, 3, 7)

The total number of triangles in the graph is [46]. The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 9, 1>, <0, 9, 3>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 9, 7>, <2, 1, 3>, <3, 7, 0>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 9, 0>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 9, 7>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 0>, <6, 0, 7>, <6, 0, 4>, <6, 1, 4>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 5, 0>, <7, 0, 9>, <7, 3, 9>, <7, 4, 1>, <7, 4, 3>, <7, 4, 6>, <9, 0, 1>, <9, 0, 3>, <9, 1, 6>, <9, 1, 7>, <9, 3, 7>
