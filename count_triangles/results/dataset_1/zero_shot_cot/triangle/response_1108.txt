Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to node 3.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <3, 6, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
