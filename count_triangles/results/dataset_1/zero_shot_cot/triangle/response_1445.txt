Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for closed loops of length 3. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected with three edges to form a closed loop. Let's count the number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8.

Now let's identify the triangles in the graph:
- <2, 3, 9>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 7, 9>

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
