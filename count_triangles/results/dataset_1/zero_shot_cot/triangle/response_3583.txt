Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the edges provided. 

Let's denote the nodes as follows based on the given edges:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Looking at the edges, we find the following triangles:
1. <1, 4, 2>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <1, 6, 3>
4. <1, 6, 4>
5. <2, 4, 9>
6. <3, 6, 1>
7. <3, 6, 8>
8. <3, 8, 5>
9. <3, 8, 9>
10. <4, 1, 6>
11. <4, 1, 9>
12. <4, 2, 9>
13. <4, 9, 0>
14. <4, 9, 8>
15. <5, 8, 3>
16. <8, 3, 6>
17. <8, 3, 9>
18. <8, 5, 9>
19. <8, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [19].
