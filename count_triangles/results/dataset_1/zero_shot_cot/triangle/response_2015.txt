Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, and <2, 3, 9>.
