Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node based on the given edges.
- Node 0: degree 2 (connected to 5 and 9)
- Node 1: degree 0
- Node 2: degree 3 (connected to 7, 8)
- Node 3: degree 1 (connected to 4)
- Node 4: degree 3 (connected to 3, 8)
- Node 5: degree 3 (connected to 0, 6, 8)
- Node 6: degree 1 (connected to 5)
- Node 7: degree 1 (connected to 2)
- Node 8: degree 5 (connected to 2, 3, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 9: degree 2 (connected to 0, 8)

Step 2: Count the number of triangles present in the graph.
- Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 3.
- Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 5 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 8 forms triangles with nodes 2 and 3, nodes 3 and 4, nodes 4 and 8, nodes 8 and 5, and nodes 5 and 9.

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles are <0, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, and <5, 0, 8>.
