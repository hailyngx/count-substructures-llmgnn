Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify each unique triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges in the graph.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <2, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
