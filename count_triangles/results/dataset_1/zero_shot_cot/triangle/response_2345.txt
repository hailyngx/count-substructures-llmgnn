Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's find them step-by-step:

1. Looking at the given edges, we can see that a triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected.

2. We need to find all possible combinations of three nodes from the 10 given nodes.

3. Now, let's list down the unique triangles found in the graph:

   - <0, 5, 9>
   - <1, 3, 9>
   - <1, 4, 9>
   - <1, 5, 7>
   - <1, 6, 9>
   - <2, 5, 7>
   - <3, 5, 7>
   - <9, 5, 7>

4. Finally, count the total number of triangles in the given graph which is the total number of unique triangles found:

   Total number of triangles: [8]
