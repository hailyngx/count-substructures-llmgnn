Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Determine the degree of each node.

- Node 0: 3 edges
- Node 1: 3 edges
- Node 2: 1 edge
- Node 3: 3 edges
- Node 4: 2 edges
- Node 5: 4 edges
- Node 6: 3 edges
- Node 7: 3 edges
- Node 8: 3 edges
- Node 9: 5 edges

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles:
- Choose a node and find pairs of neighbors that are connected. For example, for Node 0:
  - (0, 1) and (0, 8)
  - (1, 0) and (1, 6)
  - (0, 8) and (0, 9)

Therefore, there are 3 triangles connected to Node 0. You can follow this process for all nodes and find the total number of triangles.  

After finding all the triangles in the graph, the total number of triangles found is [18], and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 9>.
