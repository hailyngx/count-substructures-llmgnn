Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles by looking for nodes that form a cycle of length 3. In this case, we look for nodes that are connected in a loop. We can see the following triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 2, 6>
2. Triangle 2: <2, 4, 5>
3. Triangle 3: <2, 6, 8>

Now, counting the total number of triangles found, we have [3] triangles in total.
