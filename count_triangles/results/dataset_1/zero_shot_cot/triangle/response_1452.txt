Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all possible triangles among the nodes based on the given edges. Here are the triangles that can be formed in the graph:

1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 4, 6>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <1, 2, 3>
5. <1, 2, 4>
6. <1, 2, 6>
7. <2, 3, 9>
8. <2, 4, 5>
9. <2, 4, 6>
10. <4, 5, 6>

Thus, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
