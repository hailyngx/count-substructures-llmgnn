Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's solve this step-by-step to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Identifying Triangles:**
   - A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges. We need to identify all the possible triangles formed by the given edges.
   
2. **Listing Possible Triangles:**
   - Possible triangles can be found by looking at nodes that share two edges with another node.

3. **Counting Triangles:**
   - Count the total number of unique triangles found in the graph.

Let's start by listing the possible triangles based on the given edges:
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 7, 2>
- <1, 0, 8>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <3, 7, 5>
- <4, 2, 8>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles = [10].
