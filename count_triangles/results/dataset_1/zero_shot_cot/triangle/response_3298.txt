Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) 

Response:
Let's first find all the triangles in this graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's list them:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 8, 2>
3. Triangle <2, 7, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
