Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all the triangles in this graph. A triangle is a set of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the set.

Let's list out the triangles present in this graph:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 1>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [15]
