Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:
- <0, 4, 9>
- <0, 7, 5>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 9, 4>
- <3, 1, 2>
- <3, 7, 5>
- <3, 9, 6>
- <4, 0, 9>
- <5, 0, 7>
- <7, 0, 8>
- <9, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [11].
