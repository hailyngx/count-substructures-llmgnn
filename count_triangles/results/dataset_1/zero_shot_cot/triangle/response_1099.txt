Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for cycles of length 3. A cycle of length 3 forms a triangle in the graph. Let's start by listing the unique triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 4, 6>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <2, 7, 9>
4. <4, 6, 7>
5. <4, 6, 0>
6. <4, 6, 1>
7. <8, 0, 3>
8. <8, 0, 4>
9. <8, 3, 9>

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles based on the unique triangles identified above.

Total number of triangles: [9]
