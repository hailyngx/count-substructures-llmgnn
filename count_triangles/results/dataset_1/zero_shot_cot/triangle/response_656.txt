Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by connecting three nodes with edges. 

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <1, 2, 7>
2. <1, 4, 7>
3. <1, 4, 9>
4. <1, 6, 2>
5. <1, 6, 7>
6. <2, 4, 7>
7. <2, 4, 9>
8. <2, 7, 9>
9. <2, 6, 1>
10. <4, 7, 8>
11. <4, 7, 9>
12. <4, 8, 7>
13. <9, 3, 4>
14. <9, 3, 5>
15. <9, 4, 5>

Total number of triangles: [15]
