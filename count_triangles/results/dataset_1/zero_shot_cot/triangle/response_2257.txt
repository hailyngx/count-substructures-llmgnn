Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected.

Let's start by listing all the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 7, 9>
3. <2, 4, 6>
4. <2, 6, 8>
5. <3, 7, 8>
6. <4, 6, 9>

There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
