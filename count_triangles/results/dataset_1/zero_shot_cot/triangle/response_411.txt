Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will examine all possible triangles formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other through edges.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <0, 4, 8>
5. <2, 5, 8>
6. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
