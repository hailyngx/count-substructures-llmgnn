Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 2.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 1.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 6.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles present in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <4, 5, 9>
- Triangle 2: <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
