Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the steps to find the total number of triangles in the graph:

1. Look for triangles involving each node:
- Node 0: (0, 5, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 4, 9)
- Node 2: No triangles
- Node 3: (3, 4, 9) and (3, 5, 7)
- Node 4: (1, 3, 9)
- Node 5: (0, 2, 5) and (5, 7, 8)
- Node 6: (2, 3, 7)
- Node 7: (3, 5, 9) and (5, 6, 7)
- Node 8: (1, 5, 8)
- Node 9: (0, 1, 3)

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:
- Total number of triangles = 10

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10]. The unique triangles found are <<0, 5, 9>>, <<1, 4, 9>>, <<3, 4, 9>>, <<3, 5, 7>>, <<0, 2, 5>>, <<5, 7, 8>>, <<2, 3, 7>>, and <<1, 5, 8>>.
