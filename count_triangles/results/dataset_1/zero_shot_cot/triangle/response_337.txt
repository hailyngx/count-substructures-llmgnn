Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine all possible combinations of three nodes and check if there is an edge between each pair of nodes in the combination. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Examining all possible triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 4)
   - Triangle 2: (1, 2, 8)
   - Triangle 3: (2, 5, 8)
   - Triangle 4: (3, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 5: (4, 5, 0)
   - Triangle 6: (5, 7, 2)
   - Triangle 7: (6, 7, 8)

2. Counting the total number of triangles found:
   - Total number of triangles: [7]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <4, 5, 0>
- <5, 7, 2>
- <6, 7, 8>
