Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify triangles using the given edges.
- Looking at each node, find out the common neighbors for each pair of nodes.

0: (3, 8, 9)
1: (3, 6, 8)
2: (7, 8)
3: (0, 1)
4: (7)
5: (6, 8)
6: (1, 5)
7: (2, 4, 8)
8: (0, 1, 2, 5, 7)
9: (0)

Step 2: Count the number of triangles formed.
- Based on the common neighbors identified above, we can see the following triangles:

<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<7, 4, 8>
<8, 5, 6>
<8, 5, 7>

Step 3: Provide the final answer.
- The total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
