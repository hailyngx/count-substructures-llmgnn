Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's count the number of triangles within the graph.

To determine the number of triangles, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

From the list of edges provided, we can identify the following triangles:
1) (0, 2, 9)
2) (0, 7, 9)
3) (1, 3, 9)
4) (5, 6, 9)
5) (7, 8, 9)

Now, we count the total number of unique triangles:
[5] 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
