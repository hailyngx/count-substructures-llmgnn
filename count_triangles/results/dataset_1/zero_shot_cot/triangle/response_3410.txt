Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find the number of unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Let's list all triangles in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 3, 2>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 3, 5>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 4: <0, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 5: <2, 3, 5>
   - Triangle 6: <2, 4, 5>
   - Triangle 7: <4, 5, 9>
   - Triangle 8: <7, 4, 8>
   - Triangle 9: <7, 8, 9>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles:
   - Total Number of Triangles: [9]

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
