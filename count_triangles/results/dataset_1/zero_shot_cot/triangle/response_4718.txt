Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify triangles in the graph
- (0, 8, 2)
- (1, 5, 3)
- (1, 6, 8)
- (1, 6, 9)
- (2, 3, 8)
- (4, 7, 9)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles
There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
