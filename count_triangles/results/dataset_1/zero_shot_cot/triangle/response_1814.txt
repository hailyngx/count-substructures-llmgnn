Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, and <7, 8, 9>.
