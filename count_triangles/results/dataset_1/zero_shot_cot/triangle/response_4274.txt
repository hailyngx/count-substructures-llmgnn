Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are mutually connected.

Let's break down the connections for each node:
- Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3)
- Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 8)
- Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 8), (5, 9)
- Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
- Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 9)
- Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Let's now identify the triangles by looking for nodes that form triangles:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <8, 5, 9>
- <8, 7, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
