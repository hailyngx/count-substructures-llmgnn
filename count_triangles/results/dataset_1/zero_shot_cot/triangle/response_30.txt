Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes that are connected by edges. Let's step through the process:

1. Identify all triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 3)
- Triangle 2: (2, 4, 8)
- Triangle 3: (1, 2, 5)
- Triangle 4: (6, 7, 9)

2. Count the total number of triangles:
There are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <2, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, and <6, 7, 9>.
