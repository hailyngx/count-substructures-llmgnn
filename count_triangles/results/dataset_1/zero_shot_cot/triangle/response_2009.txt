Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To calculate the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are interconnected by edges. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Starting with each node:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
   - Node 2 is connected to node 5.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
   - Node 5 is connected to node 2.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
   - Node 8 is connected to node 1.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.

2. Now, let's find the triangles:
   - Triangles: <0, 3, 9>, <1, 7, 4>, <3, 7, 4>, <6, 1, 7>, <6, 4, 7>, <0, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
