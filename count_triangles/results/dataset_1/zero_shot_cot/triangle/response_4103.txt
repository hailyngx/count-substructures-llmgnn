Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles in the graph
- To form a triangle, we need three nodes connected by edges. Let's consider each node pair and check if there is a third node completing the triangle.

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 3, 7>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <3, 4, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles
- There are 6 triangles in total in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
