Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the given graph, we can calculate the total number of triangles by examining each possible triangle.

Here's a list of unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
