Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle. Let's break it down step-by-step:
1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 3 and 6
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9
3. Node 2: Connected to node 3
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 9
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6
9. Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes 0, 3, 6
- Triangle 2: Nodes 1, 4, 9
- Triangle 3: Nodes 1, 5, 9
- Triangle 4: Nodes 3, 5, 9
- Triangle 5: Nodes 5, 6, 7

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Total number of triangles: [5]
