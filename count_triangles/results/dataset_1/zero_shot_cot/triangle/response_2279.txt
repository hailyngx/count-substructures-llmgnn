Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step by looking at each set of three nodes:

1. Looking at node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9. So, the triangle <0, 5, 7> is formed.

2. Looking at node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. However, there are no triangles involving node 2 in this graph.

3. Looking at node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 8. However, there are no triangles involving node 3 in this graph.

4. Looking at node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9. However, there are no triangles involving node 4 in this graph.

5. Looking at node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. However, there are no triangles involving node 5 in this graph.

6. Looking at node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8. So, the triangles <0, 7, 3> and <0, 7, 4> are formed.

7. Looking at node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9. So, the triangles <2, 8, 9> and <3, 8, 9> are formed.

8. Looking at node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8. However, there are no triangles involving node 9 in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles are <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 4>, <2, 8, 9>, and <3, 8, 9>.
