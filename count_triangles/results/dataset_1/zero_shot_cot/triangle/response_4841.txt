Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles are: 
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
