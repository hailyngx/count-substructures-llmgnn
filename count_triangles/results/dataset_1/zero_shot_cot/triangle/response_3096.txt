Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges. Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 1, 9)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 2, 5)
3. Triangle 3: (0, 2, 8)
4. Triangle 4: (0, 4, 9)
5. Triangle 5: (0, 5, 8)
6. Triangle 6: (0, 9, 7)
7. Triangle 7: (2, 4, 9)
8. Triangle 8: (2, 5, 8)
9. Triangle 9: (4, 5, 9)
10. Triangle 10: (5, 8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
