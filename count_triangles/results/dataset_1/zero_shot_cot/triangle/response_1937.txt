Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to consider all possible combinations of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Upon analyzing the provided edges, we can determine the triangles present in the graph:

- Triangle 1: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 2: <2, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
