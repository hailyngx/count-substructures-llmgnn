Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given graph has the following edges:
- (0, 2), (0, 5)
- (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9)
- (2, 0), (2, 1)
- (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 9)
- (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 9)
- (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 9)
- (7, 1), (7, 6)
- (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Let's calculate the total number of triangles in this graph.
