Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 4, 5>
4. <0, 5, 7>
5. <2, 4, 5>
6. <2, 5, 7>
7. <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
