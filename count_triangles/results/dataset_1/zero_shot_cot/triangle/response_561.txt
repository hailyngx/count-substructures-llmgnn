Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <2, 4, 5>
2. <2, 4, 9>
3. <2, 6, 8>
4. <2, 6, 9>
5. <4, 6, 9>
6. <8, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
