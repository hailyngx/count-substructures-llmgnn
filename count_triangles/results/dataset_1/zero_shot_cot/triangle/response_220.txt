Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To identify the triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <1, 2, 5>
5. <4, 5, 7>

There are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
