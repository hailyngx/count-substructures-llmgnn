Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list out the triangles:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
