Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes with their corresponding neighbours:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 6

2. Let's analyze the triangles based on the given edges:
- Triangle 1: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 2: <6, 4, 1>
- Triangle 3: <6, 9, 2>
- Triangle 4: <6, 8, 7>
- Triangle 5: <0, 6, 4>

The total number of triangles is [5].
