Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find all triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges, therefore we need to find all sets of three nodes that are interconnected.

By examining the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 3
- Node 4 is connected to node 8
- Node 5 is connected to node 1
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8

Now, let's list the unique triangles:
1. <0, 6, 8>
2. <0, 6, 9>
3. <0, 8, 9>
4. <1, 3, 5>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <2, 6, 9>
7. <2, 8, 9>
8. <6, 8, 9>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
