Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can list out the unique triangles present and then count them.

Unique triangles:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 5, 6>
3. <1, 8, 9>
4. <2, 7, 9>
5. <3, 5, 6>
6. <5, 7, 8>
7. <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
