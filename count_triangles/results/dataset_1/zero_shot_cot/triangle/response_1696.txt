Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triangles formed by each node individually. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected with each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
