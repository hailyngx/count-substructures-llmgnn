Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all the possible triangles that can be formed using the edges provided. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes with their connected edges:
   - Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
   - Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 7}
   - Node 2: {1}
   - Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
   - Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 7, 8}
   - Node 5: {1}
   - Node 6: {0, 4, 8}
   - Node 7: {1, 3, 4}
   - Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 6}
   - Node 9: {0}

2. Let's find the triangles:
   - Triangles involving Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 8}
   - Triangles involving Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 7}
   - Triangles involving Node 2: None
   - Triangles involving Node 3: {1, 4, 7, 8}
   - Triangles involving Node 4: {6, 7, 8}
   - Triangles involving Node 5: None
   - Triangles involving Node 6: {8}
   - Triangles involving Node 7: {4}
   - Triangles involving Node 8: None
   - Triangles involving Node 9: None

3. Counting unique triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 7
     [<3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
