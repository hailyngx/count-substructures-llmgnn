Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list out the triangles we can find in this graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <1, 4, 5>
5. <5, 6, 7>
6. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
