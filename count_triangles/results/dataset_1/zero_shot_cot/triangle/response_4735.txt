Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to analyze each possible triangle of three connected nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 1.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 2: <1, 3, 4>

As there are only 2 triangles in this graph, the total number of triangles is [2].
