Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for cycles of length 3. In this case, triangles are the cycles of length 3 in the graph. 

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 7, 2>
3. <0, 8, 2>
4. <1, 5, 0>
5. <2, 3, 9>
6. <2, 7, 0>
7. <2, 8, 0>
8. <2, 9, 3>
9. <3, 2, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
