Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Look for triangles involving node 0:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 3, 4)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 4, 6)

2. Look for triangles involving node 1:
   - No triangles involving node 1.

3. Look for triangles involving node 2:
   - Triangle 3: (2, 1, 3)
   - Triangle 4: (2, 1, 9)
   - Triangle 5: (2, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 6: (2, 4, 7)
   - Triangle 7: (2, 4, 9)
   - Triangle 8: (2, 5, 4)
   - Triangle 9: (2, 9, 1)

4. Look for triangles involving node 3:
   - No triangles involving node 3.

5. Look for triangles involving node 4:
   - Triangle 10: (4, 0, 3)
   - Triangle 11: (4, 0, 6)
   - Triangle 12: (4, 2, 5)
   - Triangle 13: (4, 2, 7)
   - Triangle 14: (4, 5, 2)
   - Triangle 15: (4, 7, 3)
   - Triangle 16: (4, 7, 9)
   - Triangle 17: (4, 9, 7)

6. Look for triangles involving node 5:
   - No triangles involving node 5.

7. Look for triangles involving node 6:
   - No triangles involving node 6.

8. Look for triangles involving node 7:
   - Triangle 18: (7, 3, 4)
   - Triangle 19: (7, 4, 9)

9. Look for triangles involving node 8:
   - No triangles involving node 8.

10. Look for triangles involving node 9:
    - Triangle 20: (9, 1, 2)
    - Triangle 21: (9, 1, 4)
    - Triangle 22: (9, 2, 4)
    - Triangle 23: (9, 2, 7)
    - Triangle 24: (9, 4, 7)
    
Counting all these triangles, we have found a total of 24 triangles.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [24].
