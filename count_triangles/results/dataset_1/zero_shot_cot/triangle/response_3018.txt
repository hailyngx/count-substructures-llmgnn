Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that form triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected such that each node is connected to the other two nodes.

1. Nodes with their respective connections:
   - Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 8
   - Node 1: 6, 7, 9
   - Node 2: 7, 8, 9
   - Node 3: 0, 5, 7
   - Node 4: 6
   - Node 5: 3
   - Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 8
   - Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
   - Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 7
   - Node 9: 1, 2

2. Let's identify the triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 6, 8>
   - Triangle 2: <1, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 3: <1, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 4: <2, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 5: <0, 7, 8>

3. Total number of triangles found: [5]
