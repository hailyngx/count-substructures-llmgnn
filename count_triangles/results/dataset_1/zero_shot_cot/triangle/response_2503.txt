Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node in the graph.
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4

Step 2: Identify triangles in the graph.
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 9>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles.
- Total number of triangles: [6]
