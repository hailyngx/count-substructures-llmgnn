Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique sets of three vertices that are all connected to each other. We can go through each combination of three vertices and check if they form a triangle by checking if each pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <1, 6, 7>
5. <2, 5, 8>
6. <3, 4, 6>
7. <4, 6, 8>
8. <5, 6, 8>
9. <6, 7, 4>
10. <6, 8, 0>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. So, the answer is [10].
