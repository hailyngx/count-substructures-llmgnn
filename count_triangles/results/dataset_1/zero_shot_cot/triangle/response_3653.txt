Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by three nodes connected by edges.
Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <2, 3, 7>
2. <2, 5, 9>
3. <2, 6, 4>
4. <2, 6, 7>
5. <3, 7, 6>
6. <6, 4, 2>
7. <6, 9, 5>
8. <6, 9, 7>

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [8].
