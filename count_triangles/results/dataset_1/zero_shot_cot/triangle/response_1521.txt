Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8)
