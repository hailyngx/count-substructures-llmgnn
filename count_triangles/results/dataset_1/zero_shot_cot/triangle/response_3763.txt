Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

1. Let's check each node to see which triangles exist:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.

2. From the connections, we can identify the following triangles:
- Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle <3, 6, 8>
- Triangle <3, 7, 9>

3. Finally, let's count the total number of triangles. So, the answer is:
