Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list down the triangles first and then count them:

1. <0, 2, 1>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 2, 7>
4. <0, 3, 8>
5. <1, 2, 9>
6. <2, 5, 9>
7. <4, 6, 7>
8. <4, 7, 6>
9. <4, 8, 9>
10. <4, 9, 5>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles inside brackets:

Total number of triangles: [10]
