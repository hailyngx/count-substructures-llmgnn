Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check each set of three nodes to see if they form a triangle. A triangle in a graph is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

In this case, looking at the given edges, we identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 5, 9>
5. <7, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
