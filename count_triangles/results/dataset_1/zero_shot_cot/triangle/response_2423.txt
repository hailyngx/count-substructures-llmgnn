Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8. Therefore, the possible triangles involving node 0 are <0, 1, 4> and <0, 4, 8>.

2. Node 1 is only connected to node 0, so there are no additional triangles involving node 1.

3. Node 2 is connected to node 9, but there are no triangles involving nodes 2 and 9 because they have no other common neighbors.

4. Node 3 is connected to node 7, but there are no triangles involving nodes 3 and 7 because they have no other common neighbors.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8. Therefore, the possible triangle involving node 4 is <0, 4, 7>.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 9, but there is no additional triangle involving node 5.

7. Node 6 is only connected to node 8, so there are no triangles involving node 6.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 4, but we already considered the triangle <0, 4, 7> for node 4.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6. Therefore, the possible triangle involving node 8 is <0, 5, 8>.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 5, but we already checked for triangles involving node 2.

Adding up all the unique triangles identified in the graph: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>. Hence, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.
