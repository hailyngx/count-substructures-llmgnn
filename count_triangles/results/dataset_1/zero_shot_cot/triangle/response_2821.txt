Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step. 

1. Node 0 is connected to node 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to node 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.

Now, let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (1, 6, 4)
- Triangle 2: (1, 7, 4)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <1, 6, 4> and <1, 7, 4>.
