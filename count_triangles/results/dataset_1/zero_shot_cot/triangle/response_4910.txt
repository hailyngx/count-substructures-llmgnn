Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node for later use.

Node 0: Degree 3  
Node 1: Degree 2  
Node 2: Degree 4  
Node 3: Degree 2  
Node 4: Degree 1  
Node 5: Degree 6  
Node 6: Degree 3  
Node 7: Degree 1  
Node 8: Degree 2  
Node 9: Degree 5  

Step 2: Calculate the number of triangles.

For a triangle to form, each of the three nodes must be connected to each other. Let's check each possible combination:

- Nodes 0, 2, 4: Not connected
- Nodes 0, 2, 9: Connected (triangle <0, 2, 9>)
- Nodes 0, 4, 9: Not connected
- Nodes 2, 4, 9: Not connected
- Nodes 1, 8, 9: Not connected
- Nodes 2, 5, 7: Not connected
- Nodes 3, 5, 6: Not connected
- Nodes 5, 6, 9: Connected (triangle <5, 6, 9>)
  
The total number of triangles in the graph is 2, shown as below:
