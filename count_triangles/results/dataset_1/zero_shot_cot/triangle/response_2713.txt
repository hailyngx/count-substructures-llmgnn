Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all triangles by checking each node pair for a third connecting node.
    - Triangle <0, 4, 5>
    - Triangle <0, 5, 7>
    - Triangle <0, 5, 8>
    - Triangle <0, 7, 8>
    - Triangle <3, 5, 9>
    - Triangle <4, 0, 5>
    - Triangle <4, 0, 2>
    - Triangle <4, 0, 5>
    - Triangle <4, 2, 5>
    - Triangle <5, 0, 7>
    - Triangle <5, 0, 8>
    - Triangle <5, 1, 7>
    - Triangle <5, 1, 3>
    - Triangle <5, 3, 9>
    - Triangle <5, 3, 4>
    - Triangle <7, 0, 8>
    - Triangle <8, 0, 7>
    - Triangle <8, 0, 9>
    - Triangle <9, 3, 6>
    - Triangle <9, 3, 8>
    - Triangle <9, 6, 8>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles found in step 1.
    - Total number of triangles = 21

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [21].
