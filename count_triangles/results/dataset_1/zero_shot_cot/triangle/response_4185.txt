Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for cycles of length 3. Let's list the triangles present in the graph:

1. <3, 2, 4>
2. <3, 4, 6>

Count of triangles: [2]
