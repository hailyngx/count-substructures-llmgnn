Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique combinations of three nodes that form a triangle. We can do this by examining each triplet of nodes and checking if there exist edges between each pair of nodes in the triplet.

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <1, 2, 6>
6. <1, 4, 7>
7. <1, 7, 9>
8. <2, 3, 7>
9. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
