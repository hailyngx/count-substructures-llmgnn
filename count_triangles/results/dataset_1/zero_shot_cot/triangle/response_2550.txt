Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique combinations of three nodes that form a triangle. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Check each possible combination of three nodes:
- For node 0: (0, 1, 8), (0, 1, 9), (0, 8, 9)
- For node 1: (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 6), (1, 6, 8), (1, 8, 0)
- For node 2: (2, 5, 9), (2, 7, 9), (2, 5, 7)
- For node 3: (3, 4, 1)
- For node 4: (4, 9, 1), (4, 9, 3)
- For node 5: (5, 9, 2)
- For node 6: (6, 9, 1)
- For node 7: (7, 9, 2)
- For node 8: (8, 0, 1), (8, 0, 2), (8, 1, 2)
- For node 9: (9, 0, 2), (9, 0, 4), (9, 2, 5), (9, 2, 7), (9, 4, 5), (9, 4, 6), (9, 5, 6), (9, 6, 7)

2. List the unique triangles found: 
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 7, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <8, 0, 1>
- <8, 0, 2>
- <8, 1, 2>
- <9, 0, 2>
- <9, 0, 4>
- <9, 2, 5>
- <9, 2, 7>
- <9, 4, 5>
- <9, 4, 6>
- <9, 5, 6>
- <9, 6, 7>

3. Finally, count the total number of triangles: 
The total number of triangles is [20].
