Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to each other:
   - Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
   - Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8
   - Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
   - Node 3: 1, 4
   - Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 6
   - Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 8
   - Node 6: 2, 4, 8, 9
   - Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 6
   - Node 9: 0, 2, 6

2. From the given edges, we can identify the triangles:
   - <0, 2, 5>
   - <0, 4, 5>
   - <0, 5, 8>
   - <2, 5, 8>
   - <4, 5, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
