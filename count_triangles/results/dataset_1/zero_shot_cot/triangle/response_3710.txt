Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected by edges. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles:

1. Nodes with their respective connections:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

2. Identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle 2: <1, 6, 8>
- Triangle 3: <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
