Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles by finding nodes that are interconnected to form a closed loop of length 3.

2. Since the graph is undirected, we consider a triangle as (a, b, c) where (a, b), (b, c), and (a, c) are edges in the graph.

Let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

The triangles in the graph are:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 6>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [3]
