Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 3 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are <0, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, and <5, 8, 9>. So, the total number of triangles is [3].
