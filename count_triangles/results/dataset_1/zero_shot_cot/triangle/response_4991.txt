Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We will go through each node and list the triangles it forms with its neighbors.

1. For node 0:
   - (0, 4, 1)

2. For node 1:
   - (1, 4, 5)

3. For node 2:
   - No triangles.

4. For node 3:
   - (3, 4, 9)

5. For node 4:
   - (4, 0, 7)
   - (4, 1, 5)
   - (4, 3, 9)

6. For node 5:
   - No triangles.

7. For node 6:
   - No triangles.

8. For node 7:
   - (7, 0, 1)

9. For node 8:
   - No triangles.

10. For node 9:
   - (9, 3, 4)
   - (9, 2, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7]. The unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 1>
<1, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 0, 7>
<7, 0, 1>
<9, 3, 4>
<9, 2, 8>
