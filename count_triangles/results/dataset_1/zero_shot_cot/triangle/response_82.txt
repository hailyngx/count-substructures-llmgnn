Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list out the triangles:

1. <3, 5, 9>
2. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
