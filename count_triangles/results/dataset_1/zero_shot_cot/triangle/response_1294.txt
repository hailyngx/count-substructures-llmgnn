Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <2, 3, 4>
   - Triangle 2: <2, 8, 9>
   - Triangle 3: <3, 6, 8>
   - Triangle 4: <5, 8, 9>

2. Now, let's count the total number of triangles found based on step 1:
   - Total number of triangles: [4]
