Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, let's look at each possible triangle formed by three nodes at a time:

1. (0, 8, 9)
2. (1, 7, 9)
3. (2, 4, 5)
4. (3, 6, 8)
5. (3, 8, 9)
6. (4, 5, 8)
7. (5, 8, 9)
8. (5, 4, 9)

Thus, there are 8 triangles in total [8].
