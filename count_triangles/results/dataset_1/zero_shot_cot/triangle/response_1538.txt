Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's iterate through all possible combinations of 3 nodes and check if there is an edge between every pair of nodes in the combination.

The total number of triangles in this graph is [12].

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 9, 5>
