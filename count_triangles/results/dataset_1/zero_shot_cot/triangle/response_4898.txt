Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by finding the triangles in this graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other. We can find triangles by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them in a way that forms a triangle.

Looking at the provided edges, we can find the following triangles:
1. Triangle: <0, 6, 7>
2. Triangle: <0, 6, 9>
3. Triangle: <0, 7, 1>
4. Triangle: <0, 8, 3>
5. Triangle: <0, 8, 9>
6. Triangle: <0, 9, 4>
7. Triangle: <7, 1, 7>
8. Triangle: <8, 3, 8>
9. Triangle: <8, 9, 9>
10. Triangle: <9, 4, 2>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. So, the output is [10].
