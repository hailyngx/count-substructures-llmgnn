Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Let's identify the triangles in the graph based on the given edges.
    - For a triangle, we need three vertices that are all connected to each other.

Step 2: List the triangles found in the graph:
    1. <0, 4, 8>
    2. <0, 4, 9>
    3. <0, 8, 9>
    4. <1, 2, 9>
    5. <4, 8, 9>
    
Step 3: Count the total number of triangles.
