Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected by edges to form triangles. Let's go step-by-step:

1. For each node, identify its neighbors based on the given edges:
   - Node 0: Neighbors are 5 and 7
   - Node 1: Neighbors are 2
   - Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 4, and 9
   - Node 3: Neighbors are 5, 6, and 8
   - Node 4: Neighbors are 2 and 7
   - Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 7, and 9
   - Node 6: Neighbors are 3, 5, and 8
   - Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 4, 5
   - Node 8: Neighbors are 3, 6, and 9
   - Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 5, and 8

2. Now, let's identify the triangles by checking which sets of three nodes are all interconnected:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 5, 7>
   - Triangle 2: <2, 4, 7>
   - Triangle 3: <2, 5, 9>
   - Triangle 4: <3, 5, 6>
   - Triangle 5: <3, 5, 7>
   - Triangle 6: <3, 6, 8>
   - Triangle 7: <5, 6, 8>
   - Triangle 8: <5, 8, 9>

3. Count the total number of triangles and list them:
   - Total number of triangles: [8]
