Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles by checking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here are the triangles in the given graph:

1. <2, 6, 9>
2. <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
