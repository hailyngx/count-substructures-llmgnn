Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Let's list down possible triangles based on the provided edges:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <4, 5, 7>
6. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
