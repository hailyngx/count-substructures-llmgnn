Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the following triangles:
1. (0, 4, 6)
2. (0, 6, 8)
3. (1, 6, 8)
4. (6, 5, 9)
5. There are no more triangles that can be found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4] as listed above.
