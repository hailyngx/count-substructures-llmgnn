Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
3. Triangle <3, 5, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
