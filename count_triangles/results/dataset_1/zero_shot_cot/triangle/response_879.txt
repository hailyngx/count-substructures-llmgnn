Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <0, 8, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
6. Triangle <2, 4, 5>
7. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
8. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
9. Triangle <4, 5, 8>
10. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
