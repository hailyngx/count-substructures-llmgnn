Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the steps to find and count the triangles:

1. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 4: <0, 2, 4>
2. Node 2 also forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 6: <2, 5, 6>
3. Node 2 forms another triangle with nodes 4 and 7: <2, 4, 7>
4. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 7: <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
