Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By examining the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <1, 2, 9>
2. <1, 5, 7>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <2, 5, 7>
5. <2, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
