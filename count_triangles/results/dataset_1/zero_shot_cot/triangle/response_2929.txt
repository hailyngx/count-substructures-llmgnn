Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

Triangles:
1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 9, 2>
4. <3, 5, 7>
5. <3, 5, 8>
6. <3, 6, 8>
7. <5, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [7]
