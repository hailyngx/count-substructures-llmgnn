Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triangles by checking for nodes that form closed loops of length 3. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <3, 5, 8>
7. <4, 6, 9>
8. <6, 7, 9>

Hence, there are 8 triangles in total in this graph. So, the output will be [8].
