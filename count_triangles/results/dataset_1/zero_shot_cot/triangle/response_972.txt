Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8

Edges:
- 0: (1, 5)
- 1: (0, 2), (3, 8)
- 2: (1, 5), (6)
- 3: (1, 5), (7)
- 5: (0, 2), (3, 8)
- 6: (2)
- 7: (3)
- 8: (1, 5)

Now, let's find the total number of triangles in this graph.
