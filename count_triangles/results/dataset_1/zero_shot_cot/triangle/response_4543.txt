Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected with each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <1, 2, 4>
5. <4, 5, 8>
6. <4, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [6]
