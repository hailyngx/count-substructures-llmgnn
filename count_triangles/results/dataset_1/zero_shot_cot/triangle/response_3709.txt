Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each possible triangle formed by the nodes. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <1, 2, 8>
5. <2, 3, 5>
6. <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
