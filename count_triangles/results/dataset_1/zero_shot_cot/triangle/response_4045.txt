Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Check each unique combination of 3 nodes to see if they form a triangle:
   - Triangle 1: Nodes <0, 1, 5>
   - Triangle 2: Nodes <0, 1, 8>
   - Triangle 3: Nodes <0, 2, 8>
   - Triangle 4: Nodes <0, 5, 1>
   - Triangle 5: Nodes <2, 3, 8>
   - Triangle 6: Nodes <2, 4, 9>
   - Triangle 7: Nodes <2, 5, 1>
   - Triangle 8: Nodes <2, 5, 1>
   - Triangle 9: Nodes <7, 8, 9>
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
