Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (1, 2, 8)
- Triangle 2: (2, 6, 4)
- Triangle 3: (3, 5, 6)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles:
The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

Unique triangles found:
- <1, 2, 8>
- <2, 6, 4>
- <3, 5, 6>
