Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each possible triangle formed by the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:

1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <2, 4, 5>
5. <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
