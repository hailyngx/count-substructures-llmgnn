Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Triangles occur when three nodes are interconnected with edges between each pair of nodes.

Given the edges in the graph are:
- (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7)
- (1, 5)
- (2, 8) (2, 9)
- (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9)
- (4, 0) (4, 3)
- (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8)
- (6, 8)
- (7, 0)
- (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6)
- (9, 2) (9, 3)

Let's count the number of triangles:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <2, 8, 5>
4. <3, 4, 0>
5. <3, 4, 5>
6. <8, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
