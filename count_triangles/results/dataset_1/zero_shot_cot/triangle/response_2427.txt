Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that form a triangle by being connected to each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:

<0, 1, 2>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 8, 2>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
