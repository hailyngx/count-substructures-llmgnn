Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Calculating the total number of triangles in the given graph:
- First, we will identify all triangles formed by taking each possible set of three nodes that are connected.
- Then, we will count the total number of unique triangles present in the graph.

List of unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
