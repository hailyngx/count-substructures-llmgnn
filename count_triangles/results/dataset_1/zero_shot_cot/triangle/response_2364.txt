Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. First, let's identify all the triangles in the graph by finding all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected by edges. We will go through each possible combination:
   
   - Triangles involving node 0: <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 7>
   - Triangles involving node 1: No triangles
   - Triangles involving node 2: No triangles
   - Triangles involving node 3: No triangles
   - Triangles involving node 4: <4, 1, 7>
   - Triangles involving node 5: <5, 4, 7>
   - Triangles involving node 6: No triangles
   - Triangles involving node 7: <7, 6, 8>
   - Triangles involving node 8: No triangles
   - Triangles involving node 9: No triangles
   
2. Counting the total number of triangles we found, we have 4 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
