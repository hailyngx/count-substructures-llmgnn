Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: (0, 5, 6)
- Triangle 2: (0, 6, 8)
- Triangle 3: (0, 6, 9)
- Triangle 4: (0, 7, 8)
- Triangle 5: (0, 7, 9)
- Triangle 6: (1, 7, 8)
- Triangle 7: (1, 7, 9)
- Triangle 8: (4, 8, 6)
- Triangle 9: (4, 8, 7)
- Triangle 10: (4, 9, 6)
- Triangle 11: (4, 9, 7)

Therefore, there are a total of [11] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are:
<0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 7>, <4, 9, 6>, <4, 9, 7>.
