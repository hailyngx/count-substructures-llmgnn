Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can simply examine all possible triangles by checking the connections between each triplet of nodes. A triangle exists when each node in the triplet is connected to the other two nodes.

From the given edges, let's identify all the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 8, 1>
2. Triangle <3, 9, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 2. So, the output will be [2].
