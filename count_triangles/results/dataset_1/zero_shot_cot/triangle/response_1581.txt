Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes. Let's first identify these triangles in the given graph:

1. Triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangles involving node 2: <>
3. Triangles involving node 3: <>
4. Triangles involving node 4: <>
5. Triangles involving node 5: <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 9>
6. Triangles involving node 6: <0, 6, 7>
7. Triangles involving node 7: <0, 1, 7>
8. Triangles involving node 8: <>
9. Triangles involving node 9: <2, 7, 9>

Based on the above list, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
