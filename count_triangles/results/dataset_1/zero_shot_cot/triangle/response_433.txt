Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in this graph by finding nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Considering the edges given, let's list the triangles:
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <3, 5, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles. The total number of triangles is [3].
