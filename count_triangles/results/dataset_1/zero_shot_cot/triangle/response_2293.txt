Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 4: <0, 6, 8>
- Triangle 5: <1, 5, 6>
- Triangle 6: <6, 8, 0>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
