Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the given edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 8, 3>
<6, 5, 1>
<6, 5, 3>
<6, 7, 0>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
