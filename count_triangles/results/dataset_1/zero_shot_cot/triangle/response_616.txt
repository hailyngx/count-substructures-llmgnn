Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the triangles in the graph
Triangles in a graph are formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. We will check each possible combination of three nodes to find the triangles. 

Step 2: List the unique triangles
Here are the unique triangles found in the graph: 

<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 9>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles
There are [2] triangles in the given graph.
