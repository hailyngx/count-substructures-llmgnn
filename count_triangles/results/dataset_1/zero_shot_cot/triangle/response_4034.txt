Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible combinations of three nodes that are connected in a triangle formation. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. For each node, identify its neighbors based on the given edges:
   - Node 0: Neighbors are nodes 2 and 4.
   - Node 1: Neighbor is node 2.
   - Node 2: Neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7.
   - Node 3: Neighbor is node 5.
   - Node 4: Neighbors are nodes 0 and 8.
   - Node 5: Neighbors are nodes 3 and 9.
   - Node 6: Neighbors are nodes 2 and 8.
   - Node 7: Neighbors are nodes 2 and 8.
   - Node 8: Neighbors are nodes 4, 6, and 7.
   - Node 9: Neighbor is node 5.

2. Identify the triangles formed by connecting nodes that are mutually neighbors to each other:
   - <0, 2, 4> is a triangle.
   - <2, 6, 8> is a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
