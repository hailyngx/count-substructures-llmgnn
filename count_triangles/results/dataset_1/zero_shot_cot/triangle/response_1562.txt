Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: List all triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle 3: <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle 4: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 5: <3, 5, 6>
- Triangle 6: <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle 7: <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle 8: <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle 9: <4, 5, 9>
- Triangle 10: <4, 7, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles found in the graph:
There are 10 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
