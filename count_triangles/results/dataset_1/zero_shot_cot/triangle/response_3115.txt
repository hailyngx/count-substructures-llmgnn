Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other.

Let's list down the unique triangles present in the graph:

1. <1, 2, 7>
2. <3, 4, 8>
3. <3, 9, 6>
4. <7, 8, 3>

After identifying the unique triangles, we count a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
