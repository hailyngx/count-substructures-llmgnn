Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph based on the given edges:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 3>
4. Triangle <2, 6, 4>
5. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <2, 7, 8>
7. Triangle <3, 4, 6>
8. Triangle <3, 4, 9>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [8]
