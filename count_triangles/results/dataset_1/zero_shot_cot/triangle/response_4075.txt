Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by sets of three connected nodes. Let's go through the edges provided to determine the triangles:

Edges:
- (0, 4)
- (1, 4)
- (2, 3)
- (2, 4)
- (3, 2)
- (3, 7)
- (3, 8)
- (4, 0)
- (4, 1)
- (4, 2)
- (4, 6)
- (4, 9)
- (5, 7)
- (5, 8)
- (5, 9)
- (6, 4)
- (7, 3)
- (7, 5)
- (8, 3)
- (8, 5)
- (9, 4)
- (9, 5)

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. <2, 3, 4>
2. <3, 4, 5>
3. <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
