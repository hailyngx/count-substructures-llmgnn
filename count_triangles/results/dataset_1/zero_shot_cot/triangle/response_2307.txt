Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node pairs that are connected by an edge:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
   - Node 6 is connected to node 1.
   - Node 7 is connected to node 8.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.

2. To form a triangle, we need to find nodes that are connected in a way that they form a closed loop.

3. Possible triangles can be formed by checking nodes that are interconnected:
   - <0, 2, 4>
   - <2, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
