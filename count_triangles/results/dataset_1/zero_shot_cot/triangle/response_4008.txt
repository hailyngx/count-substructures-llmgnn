Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
4. Triangle <0, 9, 6>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
6. Triangle <1, 8, 4>
7. Triangle <2, 5, 1>
8. Triangle <2, 7, 3>
9. Triangle <4, 8, 7>
10. Triangle <6, 3, 7>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total. So, the total number of triangles is [10].
