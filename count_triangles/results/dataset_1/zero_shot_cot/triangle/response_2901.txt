Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here is the list of unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
