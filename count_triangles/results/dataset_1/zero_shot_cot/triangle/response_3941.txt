Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can list all the unique triangles by looking at each possible triple of nodes and checking if there are edges between each pair of nodes in the triple. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
1. <1, 5, 6>
2. <1, 5, 2>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <1, 6, 9>
5. <1, 9, 8>
6. <2, 5, 6>
7. <4, 5, 6>
8. <6, 7, 8>
9. <6, 8, 9>
10. <6, 7, 4>
11. <9, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
