Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's check for triangles:
- Triangle 1: (1, 4, 7)
- Triangle 2: (2, 3, 9)
- Triangle 3: (2, 4, 8)
- Triangle 4: (3, 2, 9)
- Triangle 5: (4, 1, 7)
- Triangle 6: (4, 2, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is **6**. 

The unique triangles found are: <1, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 8>.
