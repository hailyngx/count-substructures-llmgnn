Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the graph, we can look for triangles by examining each triplet of nodes and checking if there are edges connecting all three nodes.

Let's list the triangles step-by-step along with their unique combinations:

1. Triangle <0, 3, 4>  
2. Triangle <2, 3, 4>  
3. Triangle <3, 6, 9>  
4. Triangle <4, 7, 8>  
5. Triangle <6, 7, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
