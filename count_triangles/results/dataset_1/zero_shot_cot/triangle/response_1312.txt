Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list out the triangles step-by-step by examining all possible combinations:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 1, 9>
4. <0, 2, 6>
5. <0, 2, 9>
6. <0, 4, 9>
7. <1, 2, 6>
8. <1, 2, 9>
9. <1, 5, 9>
10. <4, 7, 9>
11. <5, 8, 9>
12. <9, 6, 0>
13. <9, 6, 2>
14. <9, 6, 4>
15. <9, 6, 7>
16. <9, 6, 8>
17. <9, 7, 4>
18. <9, 7, 5>
19. <9, 7, 8>
20. <9, 8, 5>

Counting the total number of triangles found, we get a total of **20 triangles** in the given graph. Thus, the number of triangles would be stated as [20].
