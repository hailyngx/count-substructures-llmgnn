Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. 

Let's list down the triangles we can find:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <0, 3, 4>
5. <1, 2, 5>
6. <1, 2, 9>
7. <1, 5, 9>
8. <2, 5, 6>
9. <2, 6, 9>
10. <3, 4, 2>
11. <5, 6, 9>

There are 11 triangles in total. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
