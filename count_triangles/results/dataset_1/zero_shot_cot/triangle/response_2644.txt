Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle. For a triangle, each node must be connected to both of the other two nodes in the triplet.

2. The triangles in this graph are:
   - <0, 5, 8>
   - <1, 2, 3>
   - <2, 3, 7>
   - <5, 7, 8>

3. Count the total number of triangles: [4]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
