Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the adjacency matrix based on the given edges:

```
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
  +---------------------
0 | 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 | 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 | 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
3 | 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
4 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
5 | 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
6 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
7 | 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
8 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
9 | 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle 2: <0, 2, 3>
3. Triangle 3: <0, 2, 7>
4. Triangle 4: <0, 3, 9>
5. Triangle 5: <2, 3, 7>
6. Triangle 6: <3, 7, 4>
7. Triangle 7: <3, 9, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
