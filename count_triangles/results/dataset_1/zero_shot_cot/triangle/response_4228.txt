Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by 3 nodes that are connected by edges.

There are 8 triangles in this graph:
1. <1, 3, 5>
2. <3, 6, 9>
3. <4, 7, 9>
4. <5, 7, 8>
5. <1, 0, 3>
6. <1, 0, 5>
7. <5, 2, 8>
8. <9, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
