Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle formed by nodes 0, 2, and 8.
2. Triangle formed by nodes 0, 5, and 8.
3. Triangle formed by nodes 1, 2, and 6.
4. Triangle formed by nodes 2, 4, and 8.
5. Triangle formed by nodes 2, 4, and 9.

So, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, and <2, 4, 9>.
