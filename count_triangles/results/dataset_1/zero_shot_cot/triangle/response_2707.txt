Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 2 and 4
2. Node 1: Connected to node 8
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9
4. Node 3: Connected to node 7
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 0 and 8
6. Node 7: Connected to nodes 2 and 3
7. Node 8: Connected to nodes 1 and 4
8. Node 9: Connected to node 2

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <2, 7, 3>
  
There are total [2] triangles in this graph.
