Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all possible triangles formed by the edges. We will then check which triangles are present in the graph.

First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0,1,2>
2. Triangle <0,2,3>
3. Triangle <1,2,3>
4. Triangle <2,6,8>
5. Triangle <2,6,9>
6. Triangle <3,6,8>
7. Triangle <3,8,9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
