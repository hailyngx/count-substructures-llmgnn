Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, and 3.
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7.
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 3.
4. Node 3 forms triangles with nodes 0 and 7.
5. Node 4 does not participate in any triangle.
6. Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 3 and 9.
7. Node 6 does not participate in any triangle.
8. Node 7 forms a triangle with node 9.
9. Node 8 does not participate in any triangle.
10. Node 9 does not participate in any triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 2, 3>, <3, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, and <5, 7, 9>.
