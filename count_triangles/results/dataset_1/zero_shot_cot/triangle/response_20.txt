Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can do this by examining each possible triangle formed by the edges in the graph.

Let's list down the unique triangles and then count the total number of triangles.

Unique Triangles:
1. <1, 2, 6>
2. <3, 4, 6>
3. <3, 4, 9>
4. <4, 6, 9>
5. <4, 8, 9>
6. <6, 7, 9>
7. <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
