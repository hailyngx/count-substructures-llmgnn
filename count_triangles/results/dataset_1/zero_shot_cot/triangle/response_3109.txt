Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we'll look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After examining the given graph, the triangles found are:
- <3, 4, 2>
- <6, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
