Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. In other words, we are looking for triangles.

First, let's list all possible triangles by examining each triplet of nodes. Then, we'll check if these triplets form triangles based on the given edges.

Possible triangles:
1. (0, 1, 2)
2. (0, 1, 3)
3. (0, 1, 4)
4. (0, 2, 3)
5. (0, 4, 2)
6. (1, 2, 3)
7. (1, 3, 4)
8. (2, 3, 4)

Now, let's check which of these possible triangles are actually present in the graph based on the given edges:
1. (0, 1, 2) --> Not a triangle
2. (0, 1, 3) --> Triangle <0, 1, 3>
3. (0, 1, 4) --> Triangle <0, 1, 4>
4. (0, 2, 3) --> Not a triangle
5. (0, 4, 2) --> Triangle <0, 4, 2>
6. (1, 2, 3) --> Not a triangle
7. (1, 3, 4) --> Not a triangle
8. (2, 3, 4) --> Not a triangle

There are 3 triangles in the given graph: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, and <0, 4, 2>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
