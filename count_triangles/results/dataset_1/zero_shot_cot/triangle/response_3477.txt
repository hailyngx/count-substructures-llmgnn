Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all possible sets of three nodes that are interconnected. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 2>
4. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
5. Triangle <2, 9, 7>
6. Triangle <2, 0, 4>
7. Triangle <2, 0, 3>
8. Triangle <3, 8, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
