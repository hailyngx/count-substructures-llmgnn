Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be found by counting the number of triangles each node participates in. Let's calculate this step-by-step:

- Node 0: Triangles = 0
- Node 1: Triangles = 0
- Node 3: Triangles = 0
- Node 4: Triangles = 0
- Node 5: Triangles = 1 (<0, 5, 8>)
- Node 6: Triangles = 1 (<0, 6, 7>)
- Node 7: Triangles = 1 (<1, 7, 6>)
- Node 8: Triangles = 1 (<5, 8, 1>)
- Node 9: Triangles = 0

Total number of triangles: [4]
