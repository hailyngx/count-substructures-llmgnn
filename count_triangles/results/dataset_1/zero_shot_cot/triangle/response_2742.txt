Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
2. Triangle <2, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 8, 7>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 9>

There are 5 triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [5].
