Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: Nodes (0, 2, 4)
- Triangle 2: Nodes (1, 3, 5)
- Triangle 3: Nodes (4, 7, 5)
- Triangle 4: Nodes (4, 6, 5)
- Triangle 5: Nodes (5, 6, 9)
- Triangle 6: Nodes (7, 9, 5)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 6, 5>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 9, 5>
