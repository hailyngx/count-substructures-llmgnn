Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:

1. <1, 3, 9>
2. <1, 5, 9>
3. <2, 3, 6>
4. <2, 5, 6>
5. <5, 6, 7>
6. <2, 5, 8>
7. <2, 6, 8>
8. <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
