Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we can go through each possible triangle combination and check if they form a closed loop. Let's do this step-by-step:
1. Nodes connected to `0`: 2, 5
2. Nodes connected to `1`: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
3. Nodes connected to `2`: 0, 4, 7
4. Nodes connected to `3`: 1, 4
5. Nodes connected to `4`: 1, 2, 3, 6
6. Nodes connected to `5`: 0, 1
7. Nodes connected to `6`: 4, 8
8. Nodes connected to `7`: 2, 8
9. Nodes connected to `8`: 1, 6, 7, 9
10. Nodes connected to `9`: 1, 8

Now, we will list the unique triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <1, 8, 9>
5. <2, 4, 7>
6. <4, 6, 8>
7. <8, 9, 1>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
