Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique triangles based on the provided edges.

Let's list down the unique triangles:

<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 8, 9>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
