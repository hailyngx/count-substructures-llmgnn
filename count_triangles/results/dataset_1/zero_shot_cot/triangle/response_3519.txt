Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triangles by checking for nodes that are connected in such a way that they can form a triangle.

Let's list out the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
4. Triangle <0, 5, 2>
5. Triangle <0, 5, 4>
6. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
7. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
8. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
9. Triangle <4, 5, 7>
10. Triangle <4, 8, 9>
11. Triangle <5, 6, 7>
12. Triangle <5, 6, 9>
13. Triangle <6, 9, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [13]
