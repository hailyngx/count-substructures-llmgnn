Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other (form a triangle).

Here are the triangles found in the given graph:
1. <1, 7, 8>
2. <1, 7, 2>
3. <2, 1, 7>
4. <2, 1, 8>
5. <2, 7, 8>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
