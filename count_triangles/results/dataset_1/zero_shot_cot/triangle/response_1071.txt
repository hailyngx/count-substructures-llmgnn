Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges listed. Let's break it down:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7.

Now, let's identify the triangles:

- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 2: <2, 3, 5>
- Triangle 3: <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle 4: <4, 6, 7>

Counting the unique triangles above, we find that there are [4] triangles in total.
