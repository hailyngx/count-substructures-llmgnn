Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. For node 0: No triangles can be formed with node 0.
2. For node 1: Triangles can be formed with nodes 3 and 6.
3. For node 3: Triangles can be formed with nodes 1, 5, 6, and 7.
4. For node 4: Triangles can be formed with nodes 5 and 6.
5. For node 5: Triangles can be formed with nodes 3, 4, 6, and 7.
6. For node 6: Triangles can be formed with nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9.
7. For node 7: Triangles can be formed with nodes 3, 4, 5.
8. For node 8: No triangles can be formed with node 8.
9. For node 9: Triangles can be formed with nodes 4 and 6.

Now, let's list the unique triangles found:
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles, we find that there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
