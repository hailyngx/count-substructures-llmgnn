Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

1. One approach to count triangles is to count the number of paths of length 2 between all pairs of nodes. Any three nodes that are connected by three such paths form a triangle.

2. Another approach is to analyze each node individually:
   - For each node, we look at its neighbors and count how many triangles it participates in.
   - Then we sum up the counts for all nodes.

Let's follow the second approach in this case to count the number of triangles. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 6, 2>
- <9, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
