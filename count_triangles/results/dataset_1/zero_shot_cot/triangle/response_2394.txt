Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 9>
