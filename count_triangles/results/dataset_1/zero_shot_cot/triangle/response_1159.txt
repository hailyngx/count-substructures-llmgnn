Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's write down the nodes and their connections for easier understanding:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8  
Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8  
Node 2: 8, 9  
Node 3: 0  
Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 8  
Node 5: 0, 1, 7, 9  
Node 6: 4, 8  
Node 7: 1, 5, 8  
Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7  
Node 9: 2, 5  

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <0, 5, 7>
5. <1, 4, 8>
6. <1, 5, 7>
7. <4, 6, 8>
8. <5, 7, 9>

Since we have identified the unique triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
