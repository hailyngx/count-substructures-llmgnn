Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all possible triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Let's list out the triangles and then count the total number of unique triangles.

Possible triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <1, 4, 7>
4. <2, 3, 6>
5. <2, 3, 7>
6. <3, 6, 7>
7. <6, 5, 7>

Counting the total number of unique triangles inside brackets []:
