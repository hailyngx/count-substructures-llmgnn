Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check all possible triangles formed by three connected nodes. Let's consider each unique triangle:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 1, 7>
4. <0, 1, 8>
5. <0, 1, 9>
6. <0, 3, 5>
7. <0, 3, 9>
8. <0, 5, 9>
9. <1, 4, 7>
10. <1, 4, 8>
11. <1, 4, 9>
12. <1, 5, 7>
13. <1, 5, 8>
14. <1, 5, 9>
15. <3, 5, 7>
16. <3, 5, 8>
17. <3, 5, 9>
18. <4, 5, 7>
19. <4, 5, 8>
20. <4, 5, 9>

There are 20 unique triangles in total found in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
