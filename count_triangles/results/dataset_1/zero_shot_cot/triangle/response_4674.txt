Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected in such a way that they form a closed triangle. Triangles can be formed by having three nodes connected among themselves.

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <1, 2, 9>
4. <1, 4, 5>
5. <1, 6, 9>
6. <2, 4, 6>
7. <2, 4, 9>
8. <2, 6, 9>
9. <4, 5, 6>
10. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
