Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph as an adjacency list:
- Node 0: [1, 4, 8]
- Node 1: [0, 4, 7]
- Node 2: [9]
- Node 3: [6]
- Node 4: [0, 1, 7]
- Node 6: [3, 7, 9]
- Node 7: [1, 4, 6]
- Node 8: [0, 9]
- Node 9: [2, 6, 8]

Next, let's identify the triangles by looking for nodes that form a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected.

Now, let's list the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <4, 6, 7>
3. <6, 8, 9>

Counting the triangles, we have a total of 3 triangles in the given graph.
So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
