Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's count the number of triangles present. 

A triangle in a graph is formed when three nodes are connected in a closed loop. In this case, we can look for triangles by examining each trio of nodes to see if they are connected in the required manner.

For each node pair (i, j), we check if there is a third node k such that there are edges (i, j), (j, k), and (k, i). If such a triangle is found, we note it down.

Let's list the triangles found:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 0>
<6, 8, 0>
<8, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
