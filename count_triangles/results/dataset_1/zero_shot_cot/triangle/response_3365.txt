Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Check each possible triangle with the given edges:
   - Triangle with nodes (0, 3, 4): <0, 3, 4>
   - Triangle with nodes (0, 3, 9): <0, 3, 9>
   - Triangle with nodes (0, 4, 9): <0, 4, 9>
   - Triangle with nodes (3, 4, 9): <3, 4, 9>

2. The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
