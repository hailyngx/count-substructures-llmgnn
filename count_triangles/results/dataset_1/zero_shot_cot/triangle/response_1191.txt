Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find these triangles step by step:

1. Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 9, 1)
3. Triangle 3: (0, 9, 6)
4. Triangle 4: (2, 0, 8)
5. Triangle 5: (2, 8, 6)
6. Triangle 6: (3, 7, 8)
7. Triangle 7: (4, 6, 8)
8. Triangle 8: (4, 6, 9)
9. Triangle 9: (7, 8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
