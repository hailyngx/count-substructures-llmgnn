Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step to find the number of triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected with nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected with nodes 0, 3, and 4.
3. Node 2 is connected with nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected with nodes 1, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected with node 1.
6. Node 5 is connected with nodes 2 and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected with nodes 0 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected with nodes 0, 3, and 5.
9. Node 8 is connected with nodes 2, 3, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected with nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.

Now, let's identify the triangles by looking at each possible set of three nodes that form a triangle:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <0, 6, 9>
5. <0, 7, 3>
6. <1, 3, 7>
7. <2, 5, 7>
8. <2, 8, 3>
9. <2, 9, 8>
10. <3, 7, 5>
11. <6, 0, 9>
12. <8, 9, 2>

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in total. So, the output is [12].
