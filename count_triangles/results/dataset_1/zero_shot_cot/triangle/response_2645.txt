Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we first need to look for all possible triangles formed by the edges provided. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other directly or through other nodes.

Given the graph information, we can determine the total number of triangles and then list the unique triangles.

Let's start by identifying the triangles:

Possible triangles:
1. (0, 1, 5)
2. (0, 4, 7)
3. (0, 5, 7)
4. (0, 8, 1)

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, and <0, 8, 1>.
