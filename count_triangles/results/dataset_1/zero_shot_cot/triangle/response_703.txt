Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by sets of three connected nodes. Let's calculate this step-by-step:

1. Look for nodes that are connected to form triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 3)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 3, 9)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 3, 6)
   - Triangle 4: (2, 6, 9)

Therefore, there are 4 unique triangles in the given graph.

The total number of triangles is [4].
