Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in this graph, we need to identify all unique triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other in a triangular way. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Let's list all the unique triangles we can find:
   
   - <0, 1, 5>
   - <0, 1, 9>
   - <0, 4, 9>
   - <1, 5, 9>
   - <3, 5, 6>
   - <4, 5, 9>

2. Count the number of unique triangles: [6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 6.
