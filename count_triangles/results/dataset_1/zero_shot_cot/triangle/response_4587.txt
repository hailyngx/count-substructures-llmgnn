Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.

Let's find the triangles:
- Triangles involving node 0: None
- Triangles involving node 1: None
- Triangles involving node 2: None
- Triangles involving node 3: (2, 4, 9)
- Triangles involving node 4: None
- Triangles involving node 5: None
- Triangles involving node 7: None
- Triangles involving node 8: None
- Triangles involving node 9: (0, 5, 3)

Hence, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph: <2, 4, 9> and <0, 5, 3>.
