Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
3. Triangle <2, 1, 7>
4. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <3, 6, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
