Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 4, 8>
4. <1, 4, 9>
5. <2, 7, 8>
6. <4, 8, 9>
7. <5, 6, 7>
8. <7, 9, 8>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
