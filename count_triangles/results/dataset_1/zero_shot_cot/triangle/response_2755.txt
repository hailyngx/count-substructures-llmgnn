Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we'll follow these steps:

1. We'll identify all triangles by checking each combination of three nodes that are connected to each other (form a triangle).

2. We'll list the unique triangles found.

3. Finally, we'll count the total number of unique triangles.

Let's start by listing the unique triangles found:
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>

Now, counting the total number of unique triangles, we find that there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
