Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by sets of three nodes connected to each other.

Let's list all the triangles found:
1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <2, 7, 9>
5. <3, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [5]
