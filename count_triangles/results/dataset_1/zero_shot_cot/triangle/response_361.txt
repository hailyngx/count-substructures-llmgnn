Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges. We can see that several triangles can be formed based on the given edges. Let's list the triangles step-by-step:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 1>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <0, 7, 9>
5. <0, 8, 4>
6. <1, 2, 4>
7. <1, 9, 6>
8. <1, 9, 7>
9. <2, 4, 8>
10. <6, 9, 7>
11. <0, 2, 1>
12. <0, 3, 2>
13. <0, 6, 7>
14. <0, 7, 6>
15. <0, 8, 1>
16. <2, 3, 1>
17. <2, 1, 4>
18. <3, 1, 9>
19. <6, 9, 1>
20. <8, 4, 2>
21. <9, 7, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of [21] triangles in the given graph.
