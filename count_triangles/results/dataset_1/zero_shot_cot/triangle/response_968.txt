Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph using the given edges:
1. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <2, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <4, 5, 7>
5. Triangle <5, 7, 8>
6. Triangle <5, 7, 9>

Now, calculate the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = 6

Therefore, the answer is [6].
