Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 5, 2>, <3, 4, 9>, <5, 4, 2>, <5, 4, 9>.
