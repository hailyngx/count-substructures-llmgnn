Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can see that Node 1, Node 2, and Node 9 form a triangle as they are all connected to each other. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <1, 2, 9>.
