Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

Now, let's list the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <1, 2, 6>
4. <1, 5, 6>
5. <1, 9, 7>

Counting the number of triangles identified: [5]
