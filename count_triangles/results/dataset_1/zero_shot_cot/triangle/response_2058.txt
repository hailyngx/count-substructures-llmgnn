Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can analyze the triangles in the following way:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 0.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.

Now, let's count the triangles formed in the graph:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
