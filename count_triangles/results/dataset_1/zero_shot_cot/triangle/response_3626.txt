Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine each triplet of nodes and determine if there exists an edge between every pair of nodes in the triplet. 

Here are the triangles found in this graph:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <2, 4, 5>
4. <4, 5, 6>
5. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
