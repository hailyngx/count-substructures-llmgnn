Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
In this graph, we can count triangles by looking for nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
4. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
