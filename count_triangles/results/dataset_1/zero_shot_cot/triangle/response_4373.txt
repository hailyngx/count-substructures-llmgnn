Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Let's find the triangles:
- <0, 1, 2> (Node 0 connects to nodes 1 and 2)
- <1, 2, 8> (Node 1 connects to nodes 2 and 8)
- <2, 8, 9> (Node 2 connects to nodes 8 and 9)
- <2, 4, 9> (Node 2 connects to nodes 4 and 9)
- <6, 8, 9> (Node 6 connects to nodes 8 and 9)

So, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
