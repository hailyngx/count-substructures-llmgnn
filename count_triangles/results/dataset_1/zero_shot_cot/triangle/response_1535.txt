Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles present in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 1>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <2, 1, 5>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
7. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
