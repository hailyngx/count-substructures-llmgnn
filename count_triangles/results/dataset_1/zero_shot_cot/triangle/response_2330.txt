Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. Below are the unique triangles:
- <2, 4, 0>
- <2, 4, 3>
- <2, 9, 3>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 8, 4>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <6, 9, 2>
- <6, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
