Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. In other words, we are looking for triangles where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the triangle.

Here are the triangles in this graph:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <3, 5, 8>
3. <4, 7, 8>
4. <4, 7, 9>
5. <5, 6, 8>
6. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
