Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes have edges connecting each other.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <1, 4, 8>
2. <2, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
