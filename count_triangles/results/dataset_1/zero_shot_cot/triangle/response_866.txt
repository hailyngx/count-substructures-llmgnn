Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for all the possible triangles formed by nodes connected by edges. 

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
