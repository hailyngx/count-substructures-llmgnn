Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The triangles in this graph are formed by sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes. Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 4, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
5. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 6, 7>
8. Triangle <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 8 triangles in this graph. So, the answer is [8].
