Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Determine all triangles in the graph.  
Here are the triangles listed with their nodes:  
<0, 2, 3>  
<1, 3, 5>  
<1, 3, 8>  
<2, 5, 8>  
<8, 9, 7>  

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.  
Total number of triangles: [5]
