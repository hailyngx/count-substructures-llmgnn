Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 1
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 1

Step 2: Check for triangles in the graph by looking at each possible triangle combination.
- Triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle <0, 7, 4>
- Triangle <0, 7, 8>
- Triangle <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>
- Triangle <5, 8, 9>
- Total number of triangles = 9
