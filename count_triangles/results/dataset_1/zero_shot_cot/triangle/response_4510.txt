Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for every combination of 3 nodes that are connected to each other. A triangle is formed by 3 nodes where each node is connected to the other two.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 3, 9>
- <1, 8, 9>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [5].
