Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 4: <0, 3, 4>.
2. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 3: <1, 2, 3>.
3. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 8: <0, 4, 8>.
4. Node 4 forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 9: <4, 8, 9>.
5. Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 9: <6, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
