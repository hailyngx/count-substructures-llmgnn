Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's determine the total number of triangles present in the graph.

Looking at the given edges, we can see that the triangles can be formed by finding nodes that create cycles of length 3.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <2, 3, 5>
4. <6, 7, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
