Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given graph:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 8)

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by the nodes. Let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <0, 5, 4>
3. <0, 6, 2>
4. <4, 1, 2>
5. <4, 2, 6>
6. <4, 2, 9>
7. <4, 3, 5>
8. <5, 6, 7>
9. <8, 0, 3>
10. <8, 0, 5>
11. <8, 0, 6>
12. <8, 3, 4>
13. <8, 3, 9>
14. <8, 9, 2>
15. <9, 2, 6>

There are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.
