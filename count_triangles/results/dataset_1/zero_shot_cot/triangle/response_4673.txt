Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find out the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Let's list down the triangles and then count them:

1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 3, 4>
3. <0, 3, 8>
4. <2, 3, 5>
5. <2, 3, 8>
6. <3, 4, 9>
7. <3, 5, 8>
8. <4, 9, 7>
9. <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
