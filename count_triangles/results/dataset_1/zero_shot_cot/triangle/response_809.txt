Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degrees of each node.
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 1

Step 2: Look for triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.
- From the given edges, we can see the following triangles:
  1. <0, 1, 3>
  2. <0, 3, 8>
  3. <1, 3, 7>
  4. <4, 5, 7>
  5. <6, 7, 8>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles.
- Total number of triangles: [5]
