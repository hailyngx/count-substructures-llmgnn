Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of triangles in a graph can be calculated by counting the number of connected triples of nodes. In this case, we will analyze the given graph step-by-step.

Let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 5, 6>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
6. Triangle <0, 7, 9>
7. Triangle <2, 4, 3>
8. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
9. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
10. Triangle <2, 5, 7>
11. Triangle <2, 5, 9>
12. Triangle <2, 6, 7>
13. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
14. Triangle <2, 7, 9>
15. Triangle <4, 3, 7>
16. Triangle <4, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
