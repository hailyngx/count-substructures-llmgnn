Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the triangles that exist within the graph.

Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. **Node 0 (Edges with nodes 3 and 5):**
   - Triangle: <0, 3, 5>

2. **Node 1 (Edges with nodes 2, 6, and 7):**
   - No triangles with node 1.

3. **Node 2 (Edge with node 1):**
   - No triangles with node 2.

4. **Node 3 (Edges with nodes 0, 5, and 8):**
   - No additional triangles with node 3.

5. **Node 4 (Edges with nodes 5 and 9):**
   - No triangles with node 4.

6. **Node 5 (Edges with nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9):**
   - No additional triangles with node 5.

7. **Node 6 (Edges with nodes 1 and 8):**
   - No triangles with node 6.

8. **Node 7 (Edges with nodes 1 and 8):**
   - No triangles with node 7.

9. **Node 8 (Edges with nodes 3, 6, and 7):**
   - No additional triangles with node 8.

10. **Node 9 (Edges with nodes 4 and 5):**
    - No triangles with node 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1]. The unique triangle found is <0, 3, 5>.
