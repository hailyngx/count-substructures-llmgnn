Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 triangles in this graph. Here they are listed in the format <node1, node2, node3>: 
<0, 4, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
