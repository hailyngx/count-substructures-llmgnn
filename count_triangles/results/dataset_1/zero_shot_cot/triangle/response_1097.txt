Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by connecting three nodes that are mutually connected to each other.

Given the edges provided, we can determine the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
