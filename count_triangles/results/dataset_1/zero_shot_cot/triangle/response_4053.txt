Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles found in this graph:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
