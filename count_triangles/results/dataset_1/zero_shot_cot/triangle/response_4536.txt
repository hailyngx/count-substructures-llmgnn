Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify the sets of three nodes that form triangles. A triangle involves three nodes connected by edges in such a way that each node is connected to the other two.

Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles in this graph:

1. Look for triangles involving node 0:
   - Triangles involving node 0 are: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>.

2. Look for triangles involving node 1:
   - There are no triangles involving node 1.

3. Look for triangles involving node 2:
   - Triangle involving node 2 is: <2, 4, 6>.

4. Look for triangles involving node 3:
   - There are no additional triangles involving node 3.

5. Look for triangles involving node 4:
   - There are no additional triangles involving node 4.

6. Look for triangles involving node 5:
   - There are no triangles involving node 5.

7. Look for triangles involving node 6:
   - There are no additional triangles involving node 6.

8. Look for triangles involving node 7:
   - There are no triangles involving node 7.

9. Look for triangles involving node 8:
   - There are no triangles involving node 8.

10. Look for triangles involving node 9:
    - There are no triangles involving node 9.


After examining all nodes, the triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, and <2, 4, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
