Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 3.

Let's identify the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle 2: <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle 3: <1, 4, 7>

Total number of triangles: [3]
