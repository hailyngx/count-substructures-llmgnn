Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Looking at the edges, we find the triangles: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, and <7, 8, 5>.

2. To find more triangles, we can check if there's a common neighbor between pairs of nodes in these triangles. We find the additional triangle: <0, 5, 2>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
