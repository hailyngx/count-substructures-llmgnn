Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, we can determine the number of triangles by identifying sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

After examining all the edges, we can list down the triangles present in the graph:

1. <3, 5, 9>
2. <4, 7, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
