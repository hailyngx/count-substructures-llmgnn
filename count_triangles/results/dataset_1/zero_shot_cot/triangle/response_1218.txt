Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for every possible set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to identify the triangles in this graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 8>  
2. Triangle <0, 2, 9>  
3. Triangle <0, 8, 9>  
4. Triangle <2, 8, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
