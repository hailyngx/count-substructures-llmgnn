Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in this graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
