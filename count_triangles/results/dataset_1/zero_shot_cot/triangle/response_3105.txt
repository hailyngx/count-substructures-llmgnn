Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Check each unique combination of three nodes to see if there is an edge between all of them.
2. Count the total number of such triangles.

Let's start examining the possible triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 3> exists.
2. Triangle <2, 3, 4> exists.
3. Triangle <5, 6, 8> exists.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
