Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first list out all the triangles that we can observe in the given graph:

1. (0, 1, 7)
2. (1, 7, 5)
3. (1, 7, 0)
4. (1, 7, 8)
5. (1, 7, 9)
6. (1, 8, 9)
7. (2, 6, 3)
8. (6, 3, 2)
9. (6, 2, 3)
10. (7, 0, 1)
11. (7, 1, 8)
12. (7, 1, 9)
13. (7, 5, 1)
14. (8, 1, 9)

Now, let's count the number of unique triangles:
