Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's determine the triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to Node 2.
2. Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 8, and 9. This forms a triangle <0, 2, 8>.
3. Node 1 is connected to Node 6.
4. Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1 and 8.
5. Node 3 is connected to Node 5.
6. Node 5 is connected to Nodes 3 and 7.
7. Node 7 is connected to Nodes 5 and 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to Nodes 2, 6, 7, and 9. This forms another triangle <6, 8, 7>.
9. Node 9 is connected to Node 2.

After examining all connections, we have found two triangles: <0, 2, 8> and <6, 8, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
