Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's look for each possible triangle that can be formed by connecting three nodes.

1. Possible triangles involving node 0:
   - (0, 2), (0, 2), (2, 6) -- forms a triangle <0, 2, 6>.

2. Possible triangles involving node 1:
   - (1, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4) -- forms a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
   - (1, 4), (4, 1), (1, 5) -- forms a triangle <1, 4, 5>.

3. Possible triangles involving node 2:
   - (2, 0), (0, 2), (2, 6) -- forms a triangle <0, 2, 6>.

4. Possible triangles involving node 3:
   - No triangles.

5. Possible triangles involving node 4:
   - (4, 6), (6, 4), (4, 8) -- forms a triangle <4, 6, 8>.

6. Possible triangles involving node 5:
   - (5, 1), (1, 5), (5, 6) -- forms a triangle <1, 5, 6>.
   - (5, 6), (6, 5), (5, 9) -- forms a triangle <5, 6, 9>.

7. Possible triangles involving node 6:
   - (6, 2), (2, 6), (6, 4) -- forms a triangle <2, 4, 6>.
   - (6, 4), (4, 6), (6, 8) -- forms a triangle <4, 6, 8>.
   - (6, 5), (5, 6), (6, 9) -- forms a triangle <5, 6, 9>.

8. Possible triangles involving node 7:
   - No triangles.

9. Possible triangles involving node 8:
   - No triangles.

10. Possible triangles involving node 9:
   - No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [(0, 2, 6), (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 5), (4, 6, 8), (1, 5, 6), (5, 6, 9), (2, 4, 6)]. Thus, the answer is [7].
