Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, let's examine each possible triangle formed by three nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are pairwise connected.

Here are the unique triangles found in the given graph:
1. <0, 3, 6>
2. <1, 2, 9>
3. <4, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
