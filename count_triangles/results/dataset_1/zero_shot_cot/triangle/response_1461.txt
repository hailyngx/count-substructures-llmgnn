Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's solve this step-by-step to find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.

Now we will find the triangles based on the connections:

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <7, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
