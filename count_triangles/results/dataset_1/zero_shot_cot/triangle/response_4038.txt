Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for closed loops of length 3. Each triangle involves three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles in the graph:
1. <1, 3, 7>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <1, 3, 9>
4. <1, 5, 7>
5. <3, 5, 7>
6. <3, 5, 9>
7. <3, 6, 9>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
