Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify triangles that are formed by nodes connected to each other.

1. Nodes connected to node 0: [1, 5, 8]
2. Nodes connected to node 1: [0, 2, 3, 5]
3. Nodes connected to node 2: [1, 3, 6, 8, 9]
4. Nodes connected to node 3: [1, 2, 7, 8]
5. Nodes connected to node 4: [6]
6. Nodes connected to node 5: [0, 1, 7, 8]
7. Nodes connected to node 6: [2, 4]
8. Nodes connected to node 7: [3, 5, 8]
9. Nodes connected to node 8: [0, 2, 3, 5, 7]
10. Nodes connected to node 9: [2]

Step 2: Count the number of triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <2, 6, 8>
- [5 triangles]
