Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 7.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. Triangles involving node 0: <0, 2, 6> and <0, 3, 4>
2. Triangles involving node 1: No triangles as there is no node connected to all its neighbors.
3. Triangles involving node 2: No triangles as there is no node connected to all its neighbors.
4. Triangles involving node 3: No triangles as there is no node connected to all its neighbors.
5. Triangles involving node 4: <4, 1, 6>
6. Triangles involving node 5: No triangles as there is no node connected to all its neighbors.
7. Triangles involving node 6: No new triangles that haven't already been counted.
8. Triangles involving node 7: No triangles as there is no node connected to all its neighbors.
9. Triangles involving node 8: No triangles as there is no node connected to all its neighbors.
10. Triangles involving node 9: No triangles as there is no node connected to all its neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
