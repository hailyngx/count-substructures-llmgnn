Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in adjacency list format for easier visualization:

0: 1, 3, 4  
1: 0, 6  
2: 3, 5  
3: 0, 2, 4  
4: 0, 3, 8  
5: 2, 7  
6: 1, 9  
7: 5  
8: 4  
9: 6  

Now, let's calculate the triangles by looking for nodes that form triangles. We can see that the nodes {0, 3, 4} form a triangle as (0, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 0) are all edges in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [1] which is the triangle <0, 3, 4>.
