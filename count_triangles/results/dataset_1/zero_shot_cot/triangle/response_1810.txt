Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
3. Triangle <2, 5, 6>
4. Triangle <3, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 6, 7>
7. Triangle <5, 6, 9>
8. Triangle <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
