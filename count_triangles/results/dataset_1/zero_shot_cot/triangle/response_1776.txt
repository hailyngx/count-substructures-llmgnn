Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can do this by checking all possible combinations of 3 nodes and verifying if there exist edges between all pairs of these nodes.

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <1, 2, 3>
5. <1, 3, 4>
6. <5, 2, 9>
7. <6, 2, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]
