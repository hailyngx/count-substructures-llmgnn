Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the triangles in the graph by finding all possible sets of three nodes that are all interconnected.

Let's list the triangles:
1. <1, 3, 8>
2. <1, 8, 9>
3. <2, 4, 7>

Total number of triangles: [3]
