Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles in the graph:
1. Nodes (0, 3, 5)
2. Nodes (1, 3, 5)
3. Nodes (1, 5, 8)
4. Nodes (1, 5, 9)
5. Nodes (1, 6, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [5]
