Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].  
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, and <6, 7, 9>.
