Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step:

1. **Check each node pair to find triangles:**
    - For each node, check if there are two other nodes connected to it such that there is an edge between all three nodes.
    
2. **Identify triangles:**
    - List all unique triangles found.

3. **Count the total number of triangles:**
    - Once all unique triangles are listed, count the total number of triangles.

Let's start finding the triangles:

1. Triangle #1: <0, 9, 2>
2. Triangle #2: <3, 5, 7>
3. Triangle #3: <4, 5, 8>
4. Triangle #4: <4, 5, 6>
5. Triangle #5: <4, 6, 7>
6. Triangle #6: <4, 7, 9>
7. Triangle #7: <4, 8, 9>
8. Triangle #8: <5, 6, 7>
9. Triangle #9: <5, 6, 8>
10. Triangle #10: <5, 7, 9>
11. Triangle #11: <6, 7, 9>
12. Triangle #12: <6, 8, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
