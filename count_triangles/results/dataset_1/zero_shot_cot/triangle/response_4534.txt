Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, and <6, 7, 9>.
