Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. From the given edges, we can directly identify some triangles:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 3: (1, 4, 6)
   - Triangle 4: (3, 4, 6)
   - Triangle 5: (3, 6, 9)
   - Triangle 6: (4, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 7: (7, 0, 4)
   - Triangle 8: (8, 0, 5)
   
2. Now, let's look for more triangles by considering indirect connections:
   - Triangle 9: (0, 6, 1)
   - Triangle 10: (0, 6, 2)
   - Triangle 11: (0, 6, 3)
   - Triangle 12: (0, 6, 4)
   - Triangle 13: (0, 6, 5)
   - Triangle 14: (0, 7, 4)
   - Triangle 15: (0, 7, 5)
   - Triangle 16: (0, 7, 6)
   - Triangle 17: (0, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 18: (0, 8, 5)
   - Triangle 19: (0, 8, 6)
   - Triangle 20: (0, 8, 7)
   - Triangle 21: (1, 4, 3)
   - Triangle 22: (1, 4, 7)
   - Triangle 23: (1, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 24: (1, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 25: (1, 8, 0)
   - Triangle 26: (1, 8, 5)
   - Triangle 27: (2, 6, 3)
   - Triangle 28: (3, 4, 7)
   - Triangle 29: (3, 6, 7)
   - Triangle 30: (3, 6, 8)
   - Triangle 31: (3, 9, 8)
   - Triangle 32: (4, 1, 8)
   - Triangle 33: (5, 7, 6)
   - Triangle 34: (5, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 35: (5, 8, 0)
   - Triangle 36: (5, 8, 1)
   - Triangle 37: (6, 1, 8)
   - Triangle 38: (6, 2, 3)
   - Triangle 39: (6, 2, 4)
   - Triangle 40: (6, 2, 7)
   - Triangle 41: (6, 3, 9)
   - Triangle 42: (6, 4, 1)
   - Triangle 43: (6, 4, 7)
   - Triangle 44: (6, 7, 0)
   - Triangle 45: (6, 7, 4)
   - Triangle 46: (6, 7, 5)
   - Triangle 47: (6, 7, 8)
   - Triangle 48: (7, 0, 8)
   - Triangle 49: (8, 5, 7)
   - Triangle 50: (8, 5, 0)
   - Triangle 51: (8, 9, 3)
   - Triangle 52: (9, 3, 4)
