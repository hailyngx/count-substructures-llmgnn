Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given Graph:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 8), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (8, 4), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 8)

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we look for closed loops of length 3. Let's identify the triangles:

1. Triangle with nodes 0, 1, and 3
2. Triangle with nodes 3, 4, and 9

[2] triangles were found in the given graph.
