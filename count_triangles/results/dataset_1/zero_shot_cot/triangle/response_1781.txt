Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will examine every set of 3 nodes and check if they form a triangle by having all possible combinations connected by edges. A triangle is formed when all three nodes are connected to each other.

Let's go through each unique triangle in the graph:

1. Triangle <1, 3, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 3, 6>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 6, 9>
7. Triangle <4, 9, 6>
8. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
