Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can examine all possible triangles formed by the nodes and check if they are connected by edges. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <1, 4, 7>
3. <3, 4, 7>
4. <3, 5, 7>
5. <4, 6, 7>
6. <3, 4, 8>
7. <3, 5, 8>
8. <4, 6, 8>
9. <4, 7, 8>
10. <5, 6, 7>
11. <5, 7, 8>
12. <3, 6, 7>
13. <3, 7, 8>
14. <4, 6, 8>
15. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] triangles in the given graph.
