Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify unique triangles by looking for nodes that form closed loops of length 3. Here are the triangles found in the graph:

1. <3, 7, 8>
2. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
