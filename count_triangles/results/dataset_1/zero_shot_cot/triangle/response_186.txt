Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each unique set of three nodes that form a triangle. Keep in mind that for a triangle to exist, there should be edges connecting all three nodes.

Let's list the triangles first:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <0, 8, 6>
5. <1, 3, 2>
6. <2, 5, 7>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles: [6]
