Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges in the graph. Let's break this process down step by step:

1. We need to consider all possible triangles formed by connecting three nodes. 

2. Check each set of three nodes for triangles by verifying if each pair of nodes is connected by an edge.

Let's list the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 9>

Now, to find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we simply count the number of unique triangles we found. 

There are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
