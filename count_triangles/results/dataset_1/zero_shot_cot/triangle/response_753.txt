Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles, we need to look for loops of length 3 in the graph, which represent triangles. Let's find them step-by-step:

1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 3, 4>
4. <0, 3, 5>
5. <0, 8, 9>
6. <1, 2, 7>
7. <1, 4, 6>
8. <2, 7, 8>
9. <2, 8, 9>
10. <3, 4, 5>
11. <4, 6, 1>
12. <4, 8, 9>
13. <5, 7, 8>
14. <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [14].
