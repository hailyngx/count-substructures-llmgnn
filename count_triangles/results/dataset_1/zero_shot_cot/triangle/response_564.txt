Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Steps to find the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Identify all triangles by looking for nodes that are interconnected in a triangular pattern.
2. Count each unique triangle only once.
3. List the triangles found in step 2 inside <>.
4. Output the total number of triangles inside brackets [].

After examining the provided edges, the triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <2, 0, 5>
5. <3, 4, 5>
6. <3, 4, 8>
7. <3, 6, 8>
8. <4, 1, 5>
9. <4, 5, 9>
10. <8, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
