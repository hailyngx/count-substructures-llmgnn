Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected. We can go through each possible triangle combination and check if all the edges exist in the given list.

Let's start by listing all the triangles by inspecting the nodes and see if they form complete triangles:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <1, 2, 3>
3. <1, 3, 6>
4. <1, 3, 7>
5. <1, 6, 7>
6. <2, 3, 9>
7. <4, 0, 5>
8. <4, 0, 7>
9. <4, 5, 7>
10. <5, 3, 7>
11. <5, 3, 8>
12. <5, 4, 7>
13. <5, 4, 9>
14. <5, 7, 9>
15. <6, 1, 8>
16. <6, 1, 9>
17. <6, 8, 9>
18. <7, 1, 9>
19. <7, 4, 9>
20. <8, 5, 6>
21. <9, 2, 4>
22. <9, 2, 6>
23. <9, 2, 7>
24. <9, 4, 6>
25. <9, 4, 7>
26. <9, 6, 7>

There are 26 triangles in this graph, so the total number of triangles is [26].
