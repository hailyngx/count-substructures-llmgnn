Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each set of three nodes that are pairwise connected. Let's go step-by-step:

1. For node 0:
    - 0 is connected to 1, 6, 8, 9.
    - Check for triangles involving node 0:
        - <0, 1, 6>
        - <0, 8, 9>
        
2. For node 1:
    - 1 is connected to 0, 2, 5.
    - Check for triangles involving node 1:
        - No new triangles.
    
3. For node 2:
    - 2 is connected to 1, 4, 8.
    - Check for triangles involving node 2:
        - No new triangles.
    
4. For node 3:
    - 3 is connected to 9.
    - No triangles involving node 3.
    
5. For node 4:
    - 4 is connected to 2.
    - No triangles involving node 4.
    
6. For node 5:
    - 5 is connected to 1, 6, 7, 8, 9.
    - Check for triangles involving node 5:
        - <1, 5, 6>
        - <1, 5, 8>
        - <5, 8, 9>
    
7. For node 6:
    - 6 is connected to 0, 5.
    - No triangles involving node 6.
    
8. For node 7:
    - 7 is connected to 5.
    - No triangles involving node 7.
    
9. For node 8:
    - 8 is connected to 0, 2, 5.
    - Check for triangles involving node 8:
        - No new triangles.
    
10. For node 9:
    - 9 is connected to 0, 3, 5.
    - Check for triangles involving node 9:
        - No new triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 9>.
