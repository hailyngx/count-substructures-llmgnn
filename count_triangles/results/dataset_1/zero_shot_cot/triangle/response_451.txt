Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the steps to determine the total number of triangles:

1. Identify all possible triangles by checking each set of three nodes for connections between them.

From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 2: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 3: <3, 5, 7>
- Triangle 4: <5, 7, 8>
- Triangle 5: <0, 5, 8>
- Triangle 6: <0, 6, 8>
- Triangle 7: <2, 8, 9>
- Triangle 8: <0, 9, 2>
- Triangle 9: <7, 1, 3>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
