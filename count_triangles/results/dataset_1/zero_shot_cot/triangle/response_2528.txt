Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Calculate the degree of each node:
   - Node 0 has degree 4
   - Node 1 has degree 5
   - Node 2 has degree 3
   - Node 3 has degree 2
   - Node 4 has degree 3
   - Node 5 has degree 4
   - Node 6 has degree 3
   - Node 7 has degree 4
   - Node 8 has degree 3
   - Node 9 has degree 4

2. Count the number of triangles formed by each node:
   - Node 0: (0, 4, 5), (0, 5, 7), (0, 4, 7), (0, 4, 8)
   - Node 1: (1, 5, 7), (1, 5, 2), (1, 2, 9), (1, 2, 6), (1, 6, 3)
   - Node 2: (2, 5, 1), (2, 5, 9), (2, 1, 6)
   - Node 3: (3, 6, 1), (3, 7, 1)
   - Node 4: (4, 0, 5), (4, 0, 7), (4, 0, 8), (4, 9, 5), (4, 9, 6)
   - Node 5: (5, 0, 7), (5, 0, 8), (5, 1, 7), (5, 1, 2)
   - Node 6: (6, 1, 3), (6, 4, 9), (6, 3, 7)
   - Node 7: (7, 0, 8), (7, 0, 1), (7, 1, 8)
   - Node 8: (8, 0, 7), (8, 1, 7), (8, 7, 0)
   - Node 9: (9, 1, 2), (9, 1, 5), (9, 4, 6), (9, 4, 5)

3. Count the total number of triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 3>, <4, 0, 5>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 0, 8>, <4, 9, 5>, <4, 9, 6>, <5, 0, 7>, <5, 0, 8>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 1, 2>, <6, 1, 3>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 3, 7>, <7, 0, 8>, <7, 0, 1>, <7, 1, 8>, <8, 0, 7>, <8, 1, 7>, <8, 7, 0>, <9, 1, 2>, <9, 1, 5>, <9, 4, 6>, <9, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [29].
