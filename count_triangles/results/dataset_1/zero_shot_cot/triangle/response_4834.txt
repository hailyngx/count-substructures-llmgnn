Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. We will list these triangles and only count them once.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 3>
3. <2, 3, 4>
4. <4, 5, 6>
5. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
