Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <2, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <5, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 5>, <2, 9, 6>, <3, 4, 3>.
