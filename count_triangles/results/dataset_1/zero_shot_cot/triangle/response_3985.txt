Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: <0, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>, <7, 8, 9>
