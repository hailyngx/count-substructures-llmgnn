Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Triangles in the given graph are formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's find all the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the triangles by looking for nodes that are connected in a triangular pattern.
    
    - Triangle 1: (0, 6, 7)
    - Triangle 2: (1, 4, 5)
    - Triangle 3: (2, 5, 9)
    - Triangle 4: (2, 6, 7)
    - Triangle 5: (2, 7, 5)
    - Triangle 6: (4, 5, 7)
    - Triangle 7: (5, 6, 7)
    - Triangle 8: (5, 7, 9)
    - Triangle 9: (7, 8, 2)
    - Triangle 10: (7, 8, 4)

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles found.

    Total number of triangles: [10]
