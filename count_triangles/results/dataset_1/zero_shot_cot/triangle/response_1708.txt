Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will identify all possible triangles formed by connecting nodes through edges.

Let's list out the triangles step by step:
1. <0, 2, 1>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <1, 2, 5>
4. <1, 2, 9>
5. <1, 4, 5>
6. <1, 4, 9>
7. <1, 5, 9>
8. <1, 5, 4>
9. <1, 9, 4>
10. <2, 6, 8>
11. <4, 5, 9>
12. <6, 8, 9>

Hence, there are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph.
