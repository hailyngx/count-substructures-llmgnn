Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle involving nodes 0, 2, and 4: <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle involving nodes 2, 3, and 4: <2, 3, 4>
3. Triangle involving nodes 3, 8, and 9: <3, 8, 9>
4. Triangle involving nodes 5, 8, and 9: <5, 8, 9>

There are a total of 4 triangles. Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
