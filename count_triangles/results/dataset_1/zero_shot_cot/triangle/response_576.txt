Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's determine the triangles step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify all triangles in the graph.
- Triangle 1: (0, 3, 6)
- Triangle 2: (6, 5, 1)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.
- Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 6> and <6, 5, 1>.
