Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for each possible triangle formed by nodes connected by edges. A triangle in a graph consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Let's start by listing the triangles that can be formed in the graph:

1. <1, 3, 8>
2. <1, 4, 8>
3. <1, 9, 8>
4. <2, 3, 5>
5. <4, 5, 8>

Counting the number of triangles, we find that there are 5 triangles in total.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
