Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for unique triangles formed by three connected nodes. We will list each unique triangle found.

The triangles in the graph are:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles present in the graph.
