Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
    - Node 0 has degree 4
    - Node 1 has degree 3
    - Node 2 has degree 5
    - Node 3 has degree 4
    - Node 4 has degree 3
    - Node 5 has degree 3
    - Node 6 has degree 5
    - Node 7 has degree 3
    - Node 8 has degree 2
    - Node 9 has degree 2

Step 2: Identify triangles by examining each set of 3 nodes.
    - Triangle 1: <0, 2, 3>
    - Triangle 2: <0, 2, 6>
    - Triangle 3: <0, 3, 7>
    - Triangle 4: <1, 2, 3>
    - Triangle 5: <2, 3, 6>
    - Triangle 6: <2, 5, 6>
    - Triangle 7: <4, 1, 2>
    - Triangle 8: <6, 4, 9>
    - Triangle 9: <6, 0, 7>
    - Triangle 10: <6, 4, 1>
    - Triangle 11: <7, 5, 0>

Total number of triangles: [11]
