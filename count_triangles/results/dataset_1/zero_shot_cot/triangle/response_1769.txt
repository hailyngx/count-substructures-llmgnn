Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in this graph:
1. (0, 1, 2)
2. (1, 2, 4)
3. (1, 2, 5)
4. (1, 5, 8)

Given the above triangles, there are a total of [4] triangles in this graph.
