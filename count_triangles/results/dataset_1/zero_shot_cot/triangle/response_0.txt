Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by three connected nodes.

Looking at the graph, we can identify the triangles based on the connections between nodes. Let's list the triangles found: 

1. <1, 4, 7>
2. <3, 4, 6>
3. <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
