Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the graph:

1. (1, 6, 8)
2. (1, 6, 9)
3. (1, 7, 8)
4. (2, 0, 6)
5. (3, 6, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles inside brackets.
