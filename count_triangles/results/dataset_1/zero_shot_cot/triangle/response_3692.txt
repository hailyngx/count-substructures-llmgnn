Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by examining each combination of three connected nodes:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 9)
   - Triangle <0, 2, 4>
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5>
   - No other triangles can be formed with node 0.

2. Nodes connected to node 1: (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 8)
   - No triangles can be formed with node 1.

3. Nodes connected to node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 9)
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5>
   - No other triangles can be formed with node 2.

4. Nodes connected to node 3: (3, 5), (3, 9)
   - No triangles can be formed with node 3.

5. Nodes connected to node 4: (4, 0)
   - No triangles can be formed with node 4.

6. Nodes connected to node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7)
   - Triangle <0, 2, 5>
   - No other triangles can be formed with node 5.

7. Nodes connected to node 6: (6, 9)
   - No triangles can be formed with node 6.

8. Nodes connected to node 7: (7, 0), (7, 5), (7, 8)
   - No triangles can be formed with node 7.

9. Nodes connected to node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 7), (8, 9)
   - No triangles can be formed with node 8.

10. Nodes connected to node 9: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8)
   - No new triangles can be formed with node 9.

After examining all connected nodes, we found 2 unique triangles: <0, 2, 5> and <0, 2, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
