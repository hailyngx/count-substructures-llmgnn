Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, and <4, 6, 8>.
