Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible sets of three nodes that are interconnected. Below are the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <1, 3, 7>
4. <1, 3, 5>
5. <1, 5, 6>
6. <2, 3, 7>
7. <3, 4, 7>
8. <3, 7, 8>
9. <4, 6, 7>
10. <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
