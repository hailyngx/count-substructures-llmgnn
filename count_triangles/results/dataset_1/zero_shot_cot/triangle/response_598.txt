Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Analyzing the given graph for triangles:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 8.

Now, let's count the number of triangles based on the connections:

1. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
2. Triangle <4, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [2]
