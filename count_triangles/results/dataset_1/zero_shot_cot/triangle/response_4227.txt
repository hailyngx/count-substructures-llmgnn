Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles formed by the edges given. 

Let's list down the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 2>
<1, 4, 3>
<3, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
