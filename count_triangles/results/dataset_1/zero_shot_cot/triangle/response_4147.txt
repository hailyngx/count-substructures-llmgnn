Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each possible triangle formed by three nodes and check if there is an edge between each pair of those three nodes.

Let's list down the unique triangles present in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <0, 6, 9>
5. <1, 7, 8>
6. <2, 3, 6>
7. <2, 3, 9>
8. <2, 4, 5>
9. <3, 6, 7>
10. <3, 6, 9>
11. <4, 2, 5>
12. <8, 1, 9>
13. <8, 3, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
