Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step by step:
1. For each node, identify its neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2 and 5
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, and 3
- Node 3: Neighbors are 2 and 7
- Node 4: Neighbor is 9
- Node 5: Neighbor is 0
- Node 6: Neighbor is 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 3 and 9
- Node 9: Neighbors are 4, 6, 7

2. Now, let's look for the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 5> (Nodes 0, 2, and 5 form a triangle)
- Triangle 2: <3, 7, 9> (Nodes 3, 7, and 9 form a triangle)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5> and <3, 7, 9>.
