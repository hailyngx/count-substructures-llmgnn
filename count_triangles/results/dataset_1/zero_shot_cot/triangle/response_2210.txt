Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. First, let's list down all the triangles present in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: (0, 3, 1)
   - Triangle 2: (0, 4, 1)
   - Triangle 3: (0, 9, 1)
   - Triangle 4: (0, 5, 4)
   - Triangle 5: (0, 8, 2)
   - Triangle 6: (0, 9, 2)
   - Triangle 7: (0, 4, 5)
   - Triangle 8: (1, 3, 9)
   - Triangle 9: (3, 4, 6)
   - Triangle 10: (4, 5, 6)
   
2. Counting the number of unique triangles found: 10

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
