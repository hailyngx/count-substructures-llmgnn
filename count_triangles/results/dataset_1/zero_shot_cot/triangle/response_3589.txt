Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, let's consider each possible triangle formed by three nodes.

The possible triangles are:
1. (3, 4, 6)
2. (4, 5, 6)
3. (4, 6, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
