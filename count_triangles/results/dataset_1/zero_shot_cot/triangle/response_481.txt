Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. We will check each triplet of nodes to see if they form a triangle. 

Let's go step by step:
1. (0, 4, 8) form a triangle.
2. (5, 7, 9) form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. 

The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 8> and <5, 7, 9>.
