Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify each triangle first:

- Triangle 1: (1, 3, 4)
- Triangle 2: (1, 4, 7)
- Triangle 3: (4, 6, 8)
- Triangle 4: (4, 6, 9)

Let's count the total number of triangles and list them as unique sets inside <>:

Total number of triangles: [4] 
Unique triangles: <<1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>>
