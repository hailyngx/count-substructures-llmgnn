Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the total number of triangles in the graph.
- To find a triangle, we need to look for three nodes that are all interconnected to each other.
- Let's denote the nodes as {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
- Let's look at each combination of 3 nodes to see if they form a triangle.

Step 2: Find the triangles:
1. Possible triangles: <0, 2, 4> and <0, 2, 5>.
2. To count the total number of triangles: [2]
