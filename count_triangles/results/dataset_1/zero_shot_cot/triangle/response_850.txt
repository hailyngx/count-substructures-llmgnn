Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all the unique triangles by checking each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

By looking at the edges provided, we can list out the triangles one by one:
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <0, 7, 8>
3. <1, 0, 7>
4. <1, 7, 6>
5. <2, 6, 8>
6. <2, 4, 9>
7. <4, 2, 9>
8. <5, 7, 8>
9. <6, 1, 7>
10. <6, 2, 8>
11. <6, 7, 9>
12. <7, 0, 1>
13. <7, 1, 6>
14. <7, 5, 8>
15. <7, 6, 9>
16. <8, 0, 7>
17. <8, 2, 6>
18. <8, 5, 7>
19. <8, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are 19 triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [19].
