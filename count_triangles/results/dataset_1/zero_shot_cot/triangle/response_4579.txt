Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

1. <0, 7, 4>
2. <0, 9, 2>
3. <0, 9, 6>
4. <4, 1, 2>
5. <4, 2, 9>
6. <4, 3, 7>
7. <9, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [7]
