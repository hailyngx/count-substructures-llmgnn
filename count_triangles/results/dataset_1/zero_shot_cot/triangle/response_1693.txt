Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, let's calculate the total number of triangles.

To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all possible triangles by checking for nodes that have edges between them that could form a triangle.

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the following triangles:
1. Nodes 0, 2, and 4 form a triangle: <0, 2, 4>
2. Nodes 0, 3, and 5 form a triangle: <0, 3, 5>
3. Nodes 0, 4, and 5 form a triangle: <0, 4, 5>
4. Nodes 0, 5, and 6 form a triangle: <0, 5, 6>
5. Nodes 1, 4, and 8 form a triangle: <1, 4, 8>
6. Nodes 1, 5, and 7 form a triangle: <1, 5, 7>
7. Nodes 1, 8, and 9 form a triangle: <1, 8, 9>
8. Nodes 2, 3, and 7 form a triangle: <2, 3, 7>
9. Nodes 3, 4, and 8 form a triangle: <3, 4, 8>
10. Nodes 5, 7, and 8 form a triangle: <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total.

So, the answer is: [10]
