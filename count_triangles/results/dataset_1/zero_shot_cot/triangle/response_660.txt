Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's find the triangles present in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 7, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
3. Triangle <3, 4, 6>
4. Triangle <3, 6, 8>
5. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
6. Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
