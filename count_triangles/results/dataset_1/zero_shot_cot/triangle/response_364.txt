Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique combinations of three nodes that are interconnected to form triangles.

Let's list down the triangles based on the given edges:

1. Triangle 1: <1, 7, 4>
2. Triangle 2: <6, 9, 7>
3. Triangle 3: <8, 6, 9>
4. Triangle 4: <8, 5, 9>
5. Triangle 5: <7, 1, 4>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
