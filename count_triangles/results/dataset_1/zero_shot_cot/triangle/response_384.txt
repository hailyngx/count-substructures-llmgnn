Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes based on the given edges. 

Let's list out the unique triangles first:
1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 5, 8>
4. <2, 4, 6>
5. <4, 6, 9>
6. <5, 6, 8>
7. <6, 7, 9>

After listing the unique triangles, we count a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
