Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
We can count the number of triangles in the graph by looking for nodes that have edges connecting them to each other in a triangular manner. Let's list the triangles step by step:

1. Triangles including Node 0: 
   - <0, 2, 6>
   - <0, 6, 8>
   - <0, 6, 9>

2. Triangles including Node 1:
   - No triangles with Node 1.

3. Triangles including Node 2:
   - No triangles with Node 2. 

4. Triangles including Node 3:
   - No triangles with Node 3.

5. Triangles including Node 5:
   - No triangles with Node 5.

6. Triangles including Node 6:
   - <0, 6, 8>
   - <0, 6, 9>
   - <1, 6, 5>
   - <1, 6, 7>

7. Triangles including Node 7:
   - <0, 9, 6>

8. Triangles including Node 8:
   - No triangles with Node 8.

9. Triangles including Node 9:
   - No triangles with Node 9.

Total number of triangles: [6]
