Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

After analyzing the edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 6, 7>
4. <1, 0, 8>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <5, 7, 9>
7. <6, 4, 7>
8. <8, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
