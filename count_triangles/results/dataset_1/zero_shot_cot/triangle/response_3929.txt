Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges provided. Here is the list of unique triangles found:

<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 0, 5>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in total.
