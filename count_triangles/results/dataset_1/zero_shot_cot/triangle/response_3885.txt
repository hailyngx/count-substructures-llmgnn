Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

Before we start counting triangles, let's identify the triangles based on the given edges:

Triangles involving node 0: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 6>
Triangles involving node 1: <1, 4, 5>
Triangles involving node 2: <2, 3, 7>
Triangles involving node 3: <3, 7, 2>
Triangles involving node 4: <4, 5, 6>
Triangles involving node 5: <5, 6, 9>
Triangles involving node 6: None
Triangles involving node 7: None
Triangles involving node 8: None
Triangles involving node 9: None

Now, let's add up the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) = 6

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
