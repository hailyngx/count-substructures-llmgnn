Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles.

1. Nodes connected to Node 0: 2, 7
2. Nodes connected to Node 1: 2
3. Nodes connected to Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6
4. Nodes connected to Node 3: 4
5. Nodes connected to Node 4: 3
6. Nodes connected to Node 5: 2, 8
7. Nodes connected to Node 6: 2, 8
8. Nodes connected to Node 7: 0
9. Nodes connected to Node 8: 5, 6

Now, let's list the triangles:
1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <2, 5, 8>
3. <2, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
