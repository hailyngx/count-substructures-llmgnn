Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected (form a triangle).

From the given edge list, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <2, 1, 9>
3. <8, 3, 9>
4. <8, 5, 9>
5. <8, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
