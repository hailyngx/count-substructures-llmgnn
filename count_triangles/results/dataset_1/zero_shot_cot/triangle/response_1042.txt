Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles present. A triangle is formed when three nodes are interconnected to each other.

Let's list out the triangles present in the given graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 5, 4>
3. <1, 5, 7>
4. <3, 0, 2>
5. <3, 0, 7>
6. <3, 4, 5>
7. <7, 1, 5>
8. <7, 1, 9>
9. <7, 3, 4>

There are 9 triangles in total in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
