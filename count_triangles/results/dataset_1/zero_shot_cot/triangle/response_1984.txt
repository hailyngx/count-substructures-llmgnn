Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all triangles in the graph.
    - Triangle 1: (0, 1, 2)
    - Triangle 2: (0, 4, 9)
    - Triangle 3: (8, 9, 4)
  
Step 2: Count the total number of triangles.
    Total number of triangles = 3

Therefore, the answer is [3].
