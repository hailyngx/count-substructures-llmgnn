Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 4, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, and <7, 8, 9>.
