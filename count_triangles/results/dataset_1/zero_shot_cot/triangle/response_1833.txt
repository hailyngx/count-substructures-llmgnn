Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step, we will look for every unique triangle formed by three nodes connected to each other.

1. Starting with node 0:
   - Node 0 is not involved in any triangle.

2. Moving to node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
   - <0, 1, 3> forms a triangle.

3. Considering node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
   - No triangle forms with nodes 2, 4, and 9.

4. Moving on to node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 7.
   - <1, 3, 4> forms a triangle.
   - No other triangles can be formed with node 3.

5. Considering node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
   - <2, 4, 9> forms a triangle.
   - No other triangles for node 4.

6. Moving on to node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to node 3.
   - No triangle can be formed with node 5.

7. Considering node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
   - No triangle forms with node 6.

8. Moving to node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9.
   - <3, 4, 7> forms a triangle.
   - There is an additional triangle formed by nodes 6, 7, and 9: <6, 7, 9>.

9. Moving on to node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to node 4.
   - No triangle can be formed with node 8.

10. Considering node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
   - No triangle forms with node 9.

In total, we have found 5 unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, and <6, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
