Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's identify the triangles step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 9.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
3. Node 3 is connected to node 9.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to node 4.
8. Node 8 is connected to node 2.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Now, let's list the triangles:
1. <2, 5, 6>
2. <2, 6, 8>
3. <4, 5, 9>
4. <4, 6, 9>
5. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [5].
