Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have edges to each other forming a triangle.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 3, 7>
4. <0, 6, 9>
5. <0, 7, 9>
6. <1, 2, 7>
7. <2, 3, 8>
8. <3, 6, 9>
9. <0, 2, 7>
10. <0, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
