Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a simpler way to analyze it better:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 3, 4
- 1: 3, 6, 7
- 2: 3, 6
- 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
- 4: 0, 3, 8
- 5: 3, 6, 9
- 6: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- 7: 1
- 8: 4, 6, 9
- 9: 3, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's find the triangles in this graph:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <1, 3, 6>
3. <3, 5, 9>
4. <4, 6, 8>
5. <6, 8, 9>

Counting the total number of triangles, we have [5].
