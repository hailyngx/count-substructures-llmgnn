Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list down the triangles first before counting them.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <2, 3, 6>
2. <2, 4, 9>
3. <4, 5, 8>
4. <4, 6, 9>
5. <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
