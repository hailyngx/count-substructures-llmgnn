Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step by step to determine the triangles in this graph:

1. Looking at the edges, we see that nodes 0, 3, and 4 form a triangle because all three are connected to each other.
2. Similarly, nodes 1, 2, and 5 form another triangle as they are all connected to each other.
3. Nodes 1, 5, and 7 also form a triangle in the graph.
4. Nodes 3, 5, and 7 form another triangle.
5. Finally, nodes 5, 7, and 8 form a triangle as well.

Therefore, the graph has a total of 5 triangles. Hence, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, and <5, 7, 8>.
