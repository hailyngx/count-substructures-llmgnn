Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the triangles present in the given graph:

1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <1, 6, 7>
4. <2, 5, 8>
5. <3, 4, 5>
6. <4, 5, 8>
7. <1, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
