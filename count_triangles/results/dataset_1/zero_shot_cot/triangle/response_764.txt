Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 5, 7>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <0, 7, 9>
5. <2, 0, 5>
6. <3, 5, 9>
7. <5, 6, 9>
8. <5, 7, 9>

There are a total of 8 triangles in the given graph. So, the answer is [8].
