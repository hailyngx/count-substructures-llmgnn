Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.
To count the triangles, we can iterate through all possible triplets of nodes and check if they form a triangle by checking the existence of edges between them.

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 8>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <2, 3, 8>
5. <2, 3, 9>
6. <2, 7, 9>
7. <3, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
