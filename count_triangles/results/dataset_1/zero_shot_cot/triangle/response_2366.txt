Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Let's analyze the graph step-by-step:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Triangles can be formed from the following combinations:
1. (0, 1, 7)
2. (0, 5, 9)
3. (1, 7, 9)
4. (5, 7, 9)

Total number of triangles = 4

[Total number of triangles: 4]
