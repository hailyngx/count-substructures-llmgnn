Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles in the given graph:
1. Nodes (0, 1, 5)
2. Nodes (0, 2, 5)
3. Nodes (0, 4, 8)
4. Nodes (1, 5, 7)
5. Nodes (1, 6, 7)
6. Nodes (4, 8, 9)
7. Nodes (5, 7, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of 7 unique triangles in the graph. So, the number of triangles in the graph is [7].
