Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by three nodes connected by edges.

Looking at the given edges, we can find the triangles:
1. <0, 7, 1>
2. <0, 7, 9>
3. <0, 8, 2>
4. <0, 9, 5>
5. <6, 4, 9>
6. <6, 4, 6>
7. <6, 9, 5>
8. <7, 1, 3>
9. <9, 0, 8>

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in total in the given graph. So, the output is [9].
