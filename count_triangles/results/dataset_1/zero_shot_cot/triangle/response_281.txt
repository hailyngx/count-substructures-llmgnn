Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph.

To count the number of triangles, we need to check for each set of 3 nodes if they form a triangle by having edges between each pair of nodes.

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 3, 9>
4. <1, 3, 9>
5. <3, 4, 9>
6. <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
