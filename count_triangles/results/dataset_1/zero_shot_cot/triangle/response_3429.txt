Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are as follows:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
