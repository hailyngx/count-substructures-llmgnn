Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to check each set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list out the triangles we can find in this graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <1, 6, 7>
3. <1, 7, 8>
4. <2, 5, 7>
5. <2, 6, 7>
6. <3, 6, 7>
7. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
