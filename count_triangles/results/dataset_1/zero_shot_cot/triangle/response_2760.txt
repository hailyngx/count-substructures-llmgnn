Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of adjacency list for better visualization:
    
0: 3, 6
1: 3, 4, 5
2: 7
3: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
4: 1, 3, 5
5: 1, 4
6: 0, 7, 8, 9
7: 2, 3, 6
8: 3, 6
9: 3, 6

Now, let's identify the triangles. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other. Let's list down the triangles present in the graph:
<0, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
