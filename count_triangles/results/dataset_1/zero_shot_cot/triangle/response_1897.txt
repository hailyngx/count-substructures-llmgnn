Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected, i.e., they form a triangle.

After analyzing the provided edges, we find the following triangles:
1. <1, 2, 3>
2. <1, 3, 6>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <2, 3, 5>
5. <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
