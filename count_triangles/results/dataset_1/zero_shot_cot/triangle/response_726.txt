Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify all triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.
2. List the unique triangles found.

Let's start by listing the unique triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
