Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for all possible sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. We can identify triangles by examining each possible combination of three nodes.

Let's list down all the unique triangles in the graph:

1. <2, 4, 6>
2. <2, 4, 8>
3. <2, 6, 8>
4. <3, 6, 8>
5. <3, 6, 7>
6. <3, 7, 8>
7. <4, 6, 8>
8. <4, 5, 9>
9. <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
