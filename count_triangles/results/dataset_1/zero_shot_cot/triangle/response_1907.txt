Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to both of the other two nodes. Let's analyze the graph based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 4 and 9
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 6 and 7
- Node 2: Connected to node 5
- Node 3: Connected to node 4
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 6
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 5, 6
- Node 9: Connected to node 0

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
3. Triangle <5, 6, 8>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
