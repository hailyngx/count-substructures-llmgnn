Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
     1 -- 4
    /|    |\
   0 |    | 5
    \|    |/
     2 -- 3
      \  /
       \| 
        8

Let's find the total number of triangles in this graph.

There are three different types of triangles we need to consider:
1. Triangles with all three nodes connected directly to each other.
2. Triangles where two nodes are directly connected and the third node is indirectly connected through the two.
3. Triangles that are part of a square shape.

1. Triangles with all three nodes connected directly:
- (0, 1, 8) form a triangle.
- (0, 1, 9) form a triangle.
- (1, 4, 5) form a triangle.

2. Triangles where two nodes are directly connected and the third node is indirectly connected:
- No such triangles in this graph.

3. Triangles that are part of a square shape:
- (0, 1, 8, 9) form a square with two triangles: (0, 1, 8) and (0, 8, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4] as follows: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <0, 1, 8, 9>.
