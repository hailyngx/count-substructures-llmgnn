Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles by checking every set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 

Let's list the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 8, 9>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <0, 8, 3>
4. <0, 9, 2>
5. <0, 9, 3>
6. <2, 7, 1>
7. <2, 7, 9>
8. <3, 8, 9>
9. <8, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
