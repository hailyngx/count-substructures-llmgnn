Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that form triangles. 

Here are the triangles found in the graph:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 4, 8>
<7, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
