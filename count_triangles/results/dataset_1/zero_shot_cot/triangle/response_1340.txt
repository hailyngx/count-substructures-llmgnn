Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible combinations of 3 nodes that form a triangle. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <2, 5, 7>
3. <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
