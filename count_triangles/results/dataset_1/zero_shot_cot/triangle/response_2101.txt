Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node.
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 7

Step 2: Check for triangles involving each node.
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique triangles.
- Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [8]
