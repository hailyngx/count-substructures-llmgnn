Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. 

After analyzing the graph based on the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
