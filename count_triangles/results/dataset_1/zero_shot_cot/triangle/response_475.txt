Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

For a triangle to exist, we need three nodes connected by edges to form a closed loop.

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <0, 4, 8>
5. <1, 4, 8>
6. <2, 6, 7>
7. <2, 6, 9>
8. <3, 6, 7>
9. <3, 6, 9>
10. <4, 1, 8>

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
