Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other (i.e., form a triangle).

Let's identify the triangles in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <2, 4, 6>
4. <2, 5, 7>
5. <4, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
