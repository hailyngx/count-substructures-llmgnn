Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in this graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.

This gives us the following triangles:
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 5, 1>
- <7, 1, 5>
- <7, 2, 9>
- <3, 0, 9>
- <6, 5, 0>
- <6, 5, 1>
- <6, 5, 7>
- <6, 7, 1>
- <6, 7, 2>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <8, 7, 1>
- <8, 7, 2>
- <8, 7, 6>
- <8, 6, 5>
- <8, 6, 7>
- <8, 6, 9>
- <9, 2, 3>
- <9, 3, 0>
- <9, 3, 6>
- <9, 6, 5>
- <9, 6, 7>
- <9, 6, 2>

Therefore, there are 24 triangles in total. <24>
