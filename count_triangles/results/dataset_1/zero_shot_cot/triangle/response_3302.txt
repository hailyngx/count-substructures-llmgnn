Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Since we have 10 nodes in the graph, we can calculate the total number of triangles by examining each set of three connected nodes. Here is the list of triangles found in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 5, 6>
4. <1, 0, 5>
5. <2, 4, 8>
6. <2, 5, 8>
7. <2, 5, 3>
8. <2, 5, 6>
9. <2, 8, 9>
10. <3, 5, 9>
11. <5, 3, 9>
12. <5, 6, 9>
13. <6, 9, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
