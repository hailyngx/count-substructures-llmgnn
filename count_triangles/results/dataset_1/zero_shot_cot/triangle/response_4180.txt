Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all possible unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges.

After analyzing the given edges, we can list down the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 8, 4>
2. <0, 5, 1>
3. <0, 5, 3>
4. <1, 5, 3>
5. <2, 4, 5>
6. <2, 4, 8>
7. <3, 5, 4>
8. <3, 5, 1>
9. <3, 5, 0>
10. <3, 5, 4>
11. <3, 5, 0>
12. <3, 5, 4>
13. <3, 5, 0>
14. <4, 5, 8>
15. <6, 9, 3>

There are a total of 15 unique triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [15].
