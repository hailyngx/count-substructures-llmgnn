Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the triangles in the graph by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other:

1. Possible triangles involving node 0: 
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 8>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 7, 8>

2. Possible triangles involving node 1:
   - Triangle 3: <1, 2, 3>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 4, 8>
   
3. Possible triangles involving node 2:
   - Triangle 5: <2, 3, 9>
   
4. Possible triangles involving node 3:
   - No new triangles can be formed.

5. Possible triangles involving node 4:
   - No new triangles can be formed.
   
6. Possible triangles involving node 5:
   - No new triangles can be formed.
   
7. Possible triangles involving node 6:
   - No new triangles can be formed.
   
8. Possible triangles involving node 7:
   - No new triangles can be formed.

9. Possible triangles involving node 8:
   - Triangle 6: <8, 9, 2>

10. Possible triangles involving node 9:
    - No new triangles can be formed.

Hence, there are a total of 6 unique triangles in the given graph. So, the total number of triangles is [6].
