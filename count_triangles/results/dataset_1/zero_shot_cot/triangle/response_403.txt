Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the triangles in the given graph:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 1>
- Triangle 2: <1, 4, 2>
- Triangle 3: <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle 4: <2, 5, 4>
- Triangle 5: <2, 6, 1>
- Triangle 6: <4, 5, 2>
- Triangle 7: <4, 8, 5>
- Triangle 8: <6, 3, 9>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is 8. Therefore, the output should be [8].
