Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we analyze the given graph to count the number of triangles within it.

A triangle is formed by three nodes connected by edges. Let's identify the triangles by checking each triplet of nodes if they form a triangle. 

In this case, the triangles are formed by the following node triplets: 

1. (0, 5, 7)
2. (0, 7, 8)
3. (0, 5, 4)
4. (2, 3, 7)
5. (2, 3, 4)
6. (2, 7, 9)
7. (3, 7, 9)
8. (7, 4, 9)
9. (0, 8, 6)
10. (6, 8, 9)

Counting these unique triangles gives us a total of [10] triangles within the graph.
