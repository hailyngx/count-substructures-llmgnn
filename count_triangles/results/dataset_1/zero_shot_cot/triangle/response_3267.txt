Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify and count all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. Here are the unique triangles found in this graph:
  
  1. <4, 9, 6>
  2. <5, 7, 9>
  
There are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
