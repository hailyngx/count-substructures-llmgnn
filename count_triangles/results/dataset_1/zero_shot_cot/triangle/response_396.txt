Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 8, 3>
4. <1, 2, 5>
5. <1, 2, 9>

There are a total of 5 triangles in the graph. Hence, the number of triangles is [5].
