Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, the total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles found are <2, 4, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, and <6, 7, 8>.
