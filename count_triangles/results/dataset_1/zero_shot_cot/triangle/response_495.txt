Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 8, 9>.
