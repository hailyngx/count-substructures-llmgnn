Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify the unique triangles formed by the given edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step:
1. For each node, determine its neighbors based on the given edges:
   - Node 0 neighbors: 1, 6
   - Node 1 neighbors: 0, 4, 7
   - Node 2 neighbors: 5, 8, 9
   - Node 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 9
   - Node 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6
   - Node 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 9
   - Node 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 4
   - Node 7 neighbors: 1, 9
   - Node 8 neighbors: 2, 3, 9
   - Node 9 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8

2. Identify the triangles by checking nodes that are connected to each other:
   - Possible triangles are: {0, 1, 4}, {2, 5, 9}, {3, 4, 6}, {3, 8, 9}
   
3. Count the number of triangles and list the unique triangles:
   - Total number of triangles: [4]
   - Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 8, 9>
