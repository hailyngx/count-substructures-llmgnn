Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each unique triplet of nodes and check if there exist edges between all pairs of nodes in the triplet. If there are edges between all pairs, then we have found a triangle.

Let's list down the unique triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <1, 6, 9>
3. <2, 5, 7>
4. <2, 5, 9>
5. <3, 5, 7>
6. <5, 6, 7>
7. <5, 6, 9>

So the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
