Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify sets of three nodes that are all mutually connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles step by step:

1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 3, 8>
4. <0, 4, 2>
5. <0, 4, 5>
6. <0, 5, 2>
7. <0, 5, 8>
8. <1, 3, 2>
9. <1, 3, 7>
10. <1, 5, 2>
11. <2, 3, 7>
12. <2, 5, 4>
13. <2, 5, 7>
14. <3, 7, 8>
15. <5, 7, 8>
16. <7, 8, 9>

There are a total of 16 unique triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
