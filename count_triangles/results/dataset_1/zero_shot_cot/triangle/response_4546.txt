Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify those triangles step by step:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 8>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <0, 5, 8>
5. <1, 2, 4>
6. <1, 4, 6>
7. <1, 5, 9>
8. <2, 4, 6>
9. <4, 5, 9>
10. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of 10 triangles in the given graph, which can be represented as [10].
