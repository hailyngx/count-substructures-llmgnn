Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Prepare the adjacency matrix based on the given edges.
The adjacency matrix for the given graph is as follows:

```
