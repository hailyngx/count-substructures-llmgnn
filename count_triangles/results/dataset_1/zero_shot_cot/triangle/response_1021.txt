Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph step by step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
