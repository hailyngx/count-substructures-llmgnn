Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all possible triangles where each node is connected to the other two nodes forming a closed loop.

After examining the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 4, 7>
3. <1, 8, 4>
4. <2, 1, 4>
5. <2, 1, 7>
6. <2, 3, 7>
7. <4, 1, 7>
8. <4, 7, 3>
9. <8, 1, 4>
10. <8, 1, 7>
11. <8, 2, 1>
12. <8, 2, 3>
13. <8, 2, 9>
14. <8, 6, 0>
15. <8, 9, 4>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
