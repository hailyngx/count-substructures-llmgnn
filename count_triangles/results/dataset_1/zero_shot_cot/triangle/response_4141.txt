Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the given graph to make it easier to identify triangles:

```
   1 -- 5
  /|     |
 0 |     |
  \|     |
   2 -- 6
  /|   / |
 8 | 9   |
  \|/    |
   4 -- 7
    \
     3
```

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 5>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
4. Triangle <0, 8, 2>
5. Triangle <2, 4, 7>
6. Triangle <2, 4, 3>
7. Triangle <2, 6, 3>
8. Triangle <3, 4, 7>
9. Triangle <4, 7, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
