Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. A triangle in a graph is formed by three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Let's list the unique triangles:

1. <0, 2, 6>
2. <2, 1, 3>
3. <2, 3, 5>
4. <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
