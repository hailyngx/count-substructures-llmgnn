Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are interconnected forming a triangle. Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:

<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 5, 3>
<3, 5, 0>
<3, 5, 2>
<4, 7, 9>

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
