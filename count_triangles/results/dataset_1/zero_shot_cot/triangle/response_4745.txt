Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the existing edges. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges to form a closed loop. Let's determine the total number of triangles step-by-step:

1. Let's list down the triangles:
   - <0, 4, 1>
   - <0, 4, 9>
   - <1, 3, 4>
   - <1, 3, 9>
   - <1, 4, 9>
   - <4, 3, 9>
   - <4, 5, 7>
   - <5, 7, 8>
   - <6, 0, 1>
   - <6, 0, 4>
   - <6, 1, 4>
   - <6, 1, 8>
   - <7, 2, 8>
   - <8, 2, 9>
   - <8, 5, 4>
   - <8, 5, 7>
   - <9, 1, 3>
   - <9, 1, 4>
   - <9, 3, 4>
   - <9, 3, 8>
   - <9, 4, 8>

2. Count the total number of unique triangles: [21]

Therefore, there are a total of 21 triangles in the given graph.
