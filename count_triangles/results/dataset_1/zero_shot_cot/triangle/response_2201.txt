Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can check all possible combinations of three nodes to see if they form a triangle. We need to check whether each combination of three nodes is connected by edges in the graph.

Let's start by listing all the triangles in the graph:

1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <1, 7, 8>
3. <2, 4, 7>
4. No other triangles can be formed based on the given edges.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
