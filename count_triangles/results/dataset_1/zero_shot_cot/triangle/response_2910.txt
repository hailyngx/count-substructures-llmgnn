Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 8, 9>, and <4, 5, 6>.
