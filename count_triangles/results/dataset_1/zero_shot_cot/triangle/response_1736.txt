Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 9), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4)]

Now, let's count the number of triangles in this graph. 
Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
