Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

1. From the list of edges, we can see that the possible triangles involving each node are as follows:
   - Node 0: (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 7)
   - Node 1: No triangles
   - Node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 3, 4), (2, 4, 7), (2, 7, 8)
   - Node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 2, 4), (3, 4, 6), (3, 4, 7), (3, 7, 9)
   - Node 4: (4, 1, 2), (4, 2, 3), (4, 3, 5), (4, 3, 7), (4, 3, 9), (4, 5, 9)
   - Node 5: No triangles
   - Node 6: No triangles
   - Node 7: (7, 0, 3), (7, 2, 3), (7, 3, 4), (7, 4, 6)
   - Node 8: No triangles
   - Node 9: (9, 3, 4), (9, 4, 5)

2. Let's count the total number of unique triangles:
   - Total number of unique triangles: 10

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [10]. The unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <7, 0, 3>, <7, 4, 6>.
