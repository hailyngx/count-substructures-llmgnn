Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify and count all the unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other in a triangle formation.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 0.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.

Now, let's list the triangles:

1. <2, 5, 6>
2. <2, 5, 8>

Counting the total number of triangles, the answer is [2].
