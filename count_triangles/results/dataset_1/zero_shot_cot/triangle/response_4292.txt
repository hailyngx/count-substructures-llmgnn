Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.

1. Triangle 1: (0, 2, 6)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 2, 8)
3. Triangle 3: (2, 4, 7)
4. Triangle 4: (3, 5, 7)
5. Triangle 5: (6, 1, 9)
6. Triangle 6: (6, 5, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
