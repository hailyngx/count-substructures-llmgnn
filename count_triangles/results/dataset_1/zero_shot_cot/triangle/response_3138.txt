Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two.

Let's take a systematic approach:
1. For each node, check its neighbors.
2. Once we find a set of three nodes that are all connected to each other, we have found a triangle.

Now, let's list the triangles found:

1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <1, 4, 7>
3. <1, 7, 9>
4. <2, 5, 7>
5. <5, 7, 8>

Count of triangles = [5]
