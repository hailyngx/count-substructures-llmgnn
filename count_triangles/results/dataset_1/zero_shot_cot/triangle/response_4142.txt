Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will identify the triangles in this graph by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles found in this graph:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 8, 5>
<7, 8, 1>

Now, let's count the total number of triangles inside brackets []: [7]
