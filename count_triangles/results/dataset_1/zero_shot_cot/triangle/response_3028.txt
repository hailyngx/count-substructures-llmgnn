Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Below are the unique triangles found in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 3, 9>
4. <3, 4, 6>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
