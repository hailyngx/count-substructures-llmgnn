Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify all the possible triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the unique triangles:

1. <2, 7, 1>
2. <2, 7, 3>
3. <2, 5, 3>
4. <2, 5, 6>
5. <2, 6, 3>
6. <0, 4, 8>
7. <3, 4, 8>
8. <5, 4, 8>
9. <3, 5, 6>
10. <1, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
