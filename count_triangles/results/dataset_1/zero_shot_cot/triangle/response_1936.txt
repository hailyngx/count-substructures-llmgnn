Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2

Step 2: Find triangles using the degree of nodes
- Count the number of triangles formed by nodes with degree at least 2

Step 3: Calculate the total number of triangles in the graph
