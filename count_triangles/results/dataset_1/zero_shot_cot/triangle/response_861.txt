Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's identify the triangles step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 8 (forming a loop), but this does not form a triangle.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 1.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Now, let's check for the triangles by examining each possible combination of three connected nodes:

1. Triangle 1: <1, 3, 8>
2. Triangle 2: <1, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
