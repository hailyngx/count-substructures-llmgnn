Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles formed by the edges. Let's start by listing each possible triangle and then count the total number of unique triangles:

1. <0, 2, 1>
2. <0, 2, 4>
3. <1, 2, 7>
4. <1, 7, 4>
5. <1, 7, 6>
6. <2, 0, 1>
7. <2, 1, 7>
8. <4, 7, 6>
9. <6, 7, 4>
10. <3, 8, 5>
11. <5, 8, 6>
12. <6, 8, 3>

Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles: [12]
