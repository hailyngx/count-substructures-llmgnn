Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node  
- Node 0: degree=2  
- Node 1: degree=1  
- Node 2: degree=3   
- Node 3: degree=2   
- Node 4: degree=1   
- Node 5: degree=4    
- Node 6: degree=4    
- Node 7: degree=2   
- Node 8: degree=2
- Node 9: degree=3    

Step 2: Consider each node and calculate the number of triangles passing through that node.  
- For node 0: (5, 6) and (5, 2) are connected, creating a triangle with node 0. So, one triangle.   
- For node 1: No triangles.   
- For node 2: (5, 6) and (5, 9) are connected, creating a triangle with node 2. So, two triangles.  
- For node 3: (5, 8) and (5, 5) are connected, creating a triangle with node 3. So, one triangle.   
- For node 4: No triangles.   
- For node 5: (6, 9) and (6, 3) are connected, creating a triangle with node 5. So, three triangles.   
- For node 6: (0, 2) and (2, 9) are connected, creating a triangle with node 6. So, three triangles.   
- For node 7: No triangles.   
- For node 8: (3, 7) and (7, 5) are connected, creating a triangle with node 8. So, one triangle.   
- For node 9: (2, 6) and (2, 1) are connected, creating a triangle with node 9. So, two triangles.   

Total number of triangles = 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 13  
Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
