Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
By counting the number of triangles in the given graph:
1. Check each node and its neighbors to find triangles.
2. Count each triangle only once.
3. Skip nodes with fewer than 2 connected edges or those with no path to form a triangle.

After checking the given graph, we find that there are [8] triangles in total. They are:
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 5, 4>
<1, 0, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
