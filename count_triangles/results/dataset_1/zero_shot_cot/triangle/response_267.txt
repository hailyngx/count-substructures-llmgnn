Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for triangles formed by three nodes connected by edges. Here's a step-by-step approach to counting the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Identify Triangles:
   - From the given edges, we can identify the triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.
   - For example, if nodes A, B, and C are connected forming a triangle, the edges should exist such as (A, B), (B, C), and (C, A).

2. Count Triangles:
   - <0, 4, 6>
   - <0, 4, 7>
   - <0, 6, 7>
   - <1, 2, 9>
   - <1, 4, 7>
   - <2, 1, 9>
   - <4, 1, 7>
   - <0, 4, 6> (counted earlier)
   - <0, 4, 7> (counted earlier)
   - <0, 6, 7> (counted earlier)
   - <1, 2, 9> (counted earlier)
   - <1, 4, 7> (counted earlier)
   - <2, 1, 9> (counted earlier)
   - <4, 1, 7> (counted earlier)

3. Calculate Total Number of Triangles:
   - Total number of triangles = 7
   - Hence, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
