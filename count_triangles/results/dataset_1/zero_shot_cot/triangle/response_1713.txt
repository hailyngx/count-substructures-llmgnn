Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the sets of three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's list out the unique triangles:

1. <1, 6, 4>
2. <1, 6, 7>  

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
