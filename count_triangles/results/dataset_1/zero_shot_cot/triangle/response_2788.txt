Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges given. Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 1.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 1.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 1.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.

Now, let's find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle 4: <1, 5, 6>
- Triangle 5: <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle 6: <1, 6, 7>

Counting the total number of triangles: [6]
