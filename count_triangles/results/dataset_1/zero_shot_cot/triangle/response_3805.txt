Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's denote each node with a number from 0 to 9 and then list the triangles:
1. <1, 3, 6>
2. <1, 4, 7>
3. <1, 4, 8>
4. <2, 4, 7>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <4, 5, 8>
7. <5, 7, 8>
8. <7, 9, 0>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
