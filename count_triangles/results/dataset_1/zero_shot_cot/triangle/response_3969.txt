Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 triangles in the given graph. The triangles are: 
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
