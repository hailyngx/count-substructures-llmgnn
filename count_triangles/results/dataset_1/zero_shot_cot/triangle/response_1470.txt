Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

Looking at the nodes common between the edges, we can identify the triangles as follows:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 9>
2. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
3. Triangle <6, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 3, 8>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
