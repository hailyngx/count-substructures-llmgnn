Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all possible triangles among the nodes. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected by edges such that they form a closed loop.

Given the edges in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 6.
- Node 4 is connected to node 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.

Let's list down the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 5, 9>
4. <0, 7, 4>
5. <0, 7, 5>
6. <0, 7, 9>
7. <0, 8, 5>
8. <0, 9, 2>
9. <1, 2, 6>

From the triangles listed above, we have found 9 unique triangles in the graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
