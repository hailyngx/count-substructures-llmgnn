Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle 1: (0, 5, 9)
2. Triangle 2: (1, 3, 5)
3. Triangle 3: (1, 4, 9)
4. Triangle 4: (2, 3, 8)
5. Triangle 5: (8, 7, 9)

Next, let's count the total number of triangles: [5]
