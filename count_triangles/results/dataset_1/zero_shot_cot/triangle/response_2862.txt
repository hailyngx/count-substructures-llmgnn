Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in this graph is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 2>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 9>.
