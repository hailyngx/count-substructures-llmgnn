Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for each unique combination of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's list the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <0, 5, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 2>
4. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <1, 9, 3>
6. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
7. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
8. Triangle <2, 6, 4>
9. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
10. Triangle <2, 7, 5>
11. Triangle <3, 5, 9>
12. Triangle <5, 7, 9>
13. Triangle <6, 4, 9>
14. Triangle <6, 9, 5>

There are 14 triangles in total. So, the answer is [14].
