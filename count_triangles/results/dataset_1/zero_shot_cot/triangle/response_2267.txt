Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by nodes connected by edges.

Let's list down the triangles one by one:
1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <0, 1, 9>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <1, 6, 9>
5. <2, 6, 7>
6. <2, 6, 9>
7. <2, 7, 4>
8. <3, 4, 8>
9. <4, 6, 7>
10. <5, 6, 8>
11. <6, 7, 4>
12. <6, 9, 0>
13. <6, 9, 2>
14. <6, 9, 1>
15. <6, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
