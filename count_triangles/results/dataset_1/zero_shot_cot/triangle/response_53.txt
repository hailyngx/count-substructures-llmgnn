Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles:
1. (0, 1, 2)
2. (0, 4, 6)
3. (0, 4, 9)
4. (0, 5, 6)
5. (1, 2, 7)
6. (2, 7, 9)
7. (4, 6, 7)
8. (4, 6, 9)
9. (7, 8, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:
