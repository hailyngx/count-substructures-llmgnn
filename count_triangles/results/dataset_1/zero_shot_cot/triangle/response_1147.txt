Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of 3 nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's start by listing the triangles we can find in the graph:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 3, 5>
3. <0, 4, 9>
4. <0, 6, 7>
5. <0, 8, 2>
6. <2, 3, 5>
7. <2, 4, 0>
8. <2, 8, 0>
9. <3, 5, 1>
10. <4, 9, 5>

Therefore, there are total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
