Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.

Let's identify the triangles:
1. Triangle: <1, 5, 8>
2. Triangle: <1, 8, 9>
3. Triangle: <2, 7, 8>
4. Triangle: <2, 7, 9>

After exploring the graph, we have found a total of [4] triangles.
