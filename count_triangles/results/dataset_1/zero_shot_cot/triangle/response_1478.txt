Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all interconnected. Here are the steps to find the number of triangles:

1. Identify the triangles:
   - By looking at the edges, we can identify the triangles in the graph. For example, if nodes A, B, and C are connected by edges A-B, B-C, and C-A, then they form a triangle.

2. List the triangles:
   - By examining the edges, we find the following triangles:
     - <0, 4, 6>
     - <0, 4, 7>
     - <0, 4, 9>
     - <0, 6, 7>
     - <0, 6, 9>
     - <0, 7, 9>
     - <3, 0, 9>
     - <4, 1, 5>
     - <4, 1, 7>
     - <4, 5, 7>
     - <4, 6, 7>
     - <5, 7, 4>
     - <7, 2, 4>

3. Count the total number of triangles:
   - There are 13 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
