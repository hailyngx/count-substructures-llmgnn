Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

**Step 1:** Identify the triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other forming a closed loop.

1. Triangle 1: (0, 3) - (0, 6) - (3, 6)
2. Triangle 2: (0, 3) - (0, 7) - (3, 7)
3. Triangle 3: (0, 7) - (0, 6) - (6, 7)
4. Triangle 4: (1, 3) - (1, 4) - (3, 4)
5. Triangle 5: (1, 4) - (1, 6) - (4, 6)
6. Triangle 6: (1, 6) - (1, 9) - (6, 9)
7. Triangle 7: (7, 5) - (7, 8) - (5, 8)
8. Triangle 8: (7, 8) - (7, 9) - (8, 9)

**Step 2:** Count the total number of unique triangles found in the graph.

Total number of triangles: [8]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
