Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Observe the connections between the nodes to identify the triangles.
2. Check each possible triangle combination from the given edges.

Let's list down the triangles and then count the total number of unique triangles:

1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 1, 5>
4. <0, 2, 6>
5. <0, 7, 8>
6. <1, 3, 6>
7. <1, 4, 6>
8. <1, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [8]
