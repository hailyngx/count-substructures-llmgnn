Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to find all the sets of three nodes that are connected by edges. Let's identify the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 6, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
4. Triangle <3, 7, 9>

Since the above triangles are unique, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
