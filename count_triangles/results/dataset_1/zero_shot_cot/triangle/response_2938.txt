Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify the unique triangles formed by checking the triangles involving each node. Let's denote the nodes as follows:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's list the unique triangles found:
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 7>
<0, 9, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 6, 9>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 4, 0>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 4, 0>
<9, 7, 6>
<9, 7, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [14] triangles in the given graph.
