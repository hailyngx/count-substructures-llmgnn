Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 6, 7>
2. <3, 4, 7>
3. <4, 5, 8>
4. <6, 3, 7>
5. <7, 4, 8>

There are 5 triangles in total, which can be seen above. So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
