Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to node 2.

Now, we will identify the triangles in the graph. A triangle exists when three nodes are all connected to each other.

The triangles in this graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
