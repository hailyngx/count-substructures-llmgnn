Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we can identify the triangles in the graph by finding nodes that are connected in a way that forms a closed loop of three edges. 

Let's list the triangles present in this graph:
1. <0, 3, 5>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 7, 1>
4. <0, 7, 5>
5. <0, 8, 1>
6. <0, 8, 5>
7. <1, 4, 5>
8. <1, 7, 5>
9. <1, 8, 0>
10. <1, 8, 4>
11. <3, 5, 4>
12. <7, 0, 4>
13. <7, 5, 4>
14. <8, 0, 4>
15. <8, 0, 1>
16. <8, 1, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [16].
