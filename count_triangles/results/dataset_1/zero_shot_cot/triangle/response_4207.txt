Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the triangles:
   - (0, 5, 4)
   - (0, 5, 9)
   - (0, 9, 4)
   - (5, 4, 9)
   - (7, 3, 8)
   - (4, 7, 6)
   - (4, 7, 9)
   - (4, 6, 9)
   - (5, 8, 6)
   - (5, 8, 7)
   - (5, 8, 9)

2. Count the number of unique triangles:  <1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
