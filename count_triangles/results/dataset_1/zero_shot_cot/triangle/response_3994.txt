Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges given. 

Let's list down the triangles:
1. (0, 6, 2)
2. (0, 6, 9)
3. (5, 6, 0)
4. (5, 6, 8)
5. (6, 5, 8)
6. (9, 6, 3)

So, there are 6 unique triangles in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
