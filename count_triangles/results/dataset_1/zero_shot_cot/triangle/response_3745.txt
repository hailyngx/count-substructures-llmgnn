Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the triangles within the graph based on the edges provided. 

Let's find the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 3, 6>
4. Triangle <0, 3, 8>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 8, 9>

From the above list, we have identified 6 unique triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
