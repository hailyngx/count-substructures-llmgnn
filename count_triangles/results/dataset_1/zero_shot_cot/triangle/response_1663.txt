Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Look for nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle.
2. Check if each pair of connected nodes has a third node that is also connected to them.

The triangles found are:
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 8, 9>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the graph.
