Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 8. However, node 2 is also connected to node 8, forming a triangle <0, 2, 8>.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7. However, there is no triangle formed with these connections.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. However, we have already considered this triangle in step 1.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8. This connection forms a triangle <1, 3, 7>.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 6. However, there is no triangle formed with these connections.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9. No additional triangles are formed.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 8. However, no triangle is formed.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8. This connection already forms a triangle <1, 3, 7> and does not create any new triangles.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 6. However, all triangles involving node 8 have already been considered.

10. Node 9 is connected to node 5. However, no triangle is formed with this connection.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8> and <1, 3, 7>. Hence, the total number of triangles is [2].
