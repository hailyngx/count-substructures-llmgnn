Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges given. Let's start by listing the triangles:

1. <1, 2, 6>
2. <3, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
