Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Count of triangles: [14]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 9, 3>, <1, 5, 4>, <4, 5, 1>
