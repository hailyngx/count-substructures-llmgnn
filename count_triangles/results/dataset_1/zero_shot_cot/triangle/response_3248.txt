Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of three nodes that are fully connected, i.e., form a triangle.

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <2, 3, 4>
4. <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
