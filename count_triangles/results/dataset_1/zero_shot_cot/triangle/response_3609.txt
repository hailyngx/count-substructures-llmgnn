Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Checking the given graph for triangles:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.

Now, let's list the triangles that we find:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 6>
3. <0, 3, 7>
4. <0, 4, 3>
5. <0, 5, 9>
6. <1, 0, 7>
7. <1, 3, 9>
8. <3, 4, 0>
9. <3, 6, 0>
10. <3, 7, 0>
11. <4, 0, 3>
12. <5, 0, 9>

There are **12** triangles in total. The triangles are <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 0>, <3, 6, 0>, <3, 7, 0>, <4, 0, 3>, and <5, 0, 9>. The total number of triangles is **[12]**.
