Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's first identify all triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other in a triangular manner.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <1, 2, 5>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <1, 5, 7>
4. <5, 4, 6>
5. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
