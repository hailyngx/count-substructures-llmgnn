Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other (i.e., a triangle).

Calculating the triangles can be a bit time-consuming, so let's go step by step:

Step 1: Let's identify all the triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 2>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <0, 4, 7>
5. <1, 2, 9>
6. <1, 3, 7>
7. <1, 9, 4>
8. <2, 9, 4>
9. <4, 6, 9>
10. <4, 7, 8>
11. <7, 8, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles:
