Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we must identify sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's calculate this step by step:

1. Nodes with their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.

2. Let's identify the triangles:
- <0, 3, 1>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
