Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for the triangles by examining each set of three nodes that are interconnected.

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <0, 7, 4>
3. <2, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
