Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other.

Let's list down the unique triangles present in this graph and then count them:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 8>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
