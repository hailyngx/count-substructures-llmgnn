Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
Looking at the given graph, we can try to identify the triangles formed:

1. Triangle formed by nodes 0, 1, and 9: <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle formed by nodes 2, 5, and 8: <2, 5, 8>
3. Triangle formed by nodes 3, 5, and 6: <3, 5, 6>

Now let's count the total number of triangles: [3]
