Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph.

To count the triangles, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's list out the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 4>
3. <0, 1, 9>
4. <1, 4, 5>
5. <2, 7, 8>
6. <4, 5, 1>
7. <7, 6, 8>
8. <7, 6, 9>
9. <7, 8, 2>
10. <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in this graph. So, the total number of triangles is [10].
