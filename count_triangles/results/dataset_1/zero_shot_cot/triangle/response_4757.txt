Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for each possible triangle formed by 3 nodes. A triangle is formed when there are edges connecting all 3 nodes with each other.

Let's identify the unique triangles present in the given graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 6, 8>
4. Triangle <4, 6, 5>
5. Triangle <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
