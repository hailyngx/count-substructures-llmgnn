Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can iterate through all possible triangles formed by the nodes and check if each triangle is complete i.e., all three edges are present in the given graph. 

Here are the triangles present in the given graph:
1. <0, 1, 5>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 7, 5>
4. <0, 2, 8>
5. <2, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
