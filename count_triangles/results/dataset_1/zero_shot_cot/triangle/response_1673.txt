Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that form a triangle. A triangle is formed when three nodes are mutually connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find the total number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)
   - The nodes connected to Node 1 are 2, 6, 7, 8.

2. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 7)
   - The nodes connected to Node 2 are 1, 7.

3. Node 3: (3, 5)
   - The node connected to Node 3 is 5.

4. Node 4: (4, 6), (4, 8)
   - The nodes connected to Node 4 are 6, 8.

5. Node 5: (5, 3)
   - The node connected to Node 5 is 3.

6. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 4)
   - The nodes connected to Node 6 are 1, 4.

7. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)
   - The nodes connected to Node 7 are 0, 1, 2.

8. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 9)
   - The nodes connected to Node 8 are 1, 4, 9.

9. Node 9: (9, 8)
   - The node connected to Node 9 is 8.

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph:

- Triangle 1: <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle 2: <1, 7, 8>
- Triangle 3: <1, 6, 4>
- Triangle 4: <8, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
