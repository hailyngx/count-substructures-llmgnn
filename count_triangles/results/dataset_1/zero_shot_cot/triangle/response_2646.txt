Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes based on the given edges. Let's go step-by-step to determine the total number of triangles:

Step 1: Find the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2
- Node 4: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6
- Node 9: 4, 5

Step 2: Look for triangles by checking nodes connected to the same node:
- Triangles involving Node 0: (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)
- Triangles involving Node 3: (0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2)
- Triangles involving Node 4: (2, 8)
- Triangles involving Node 6: (5, 7), (7, 8), (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the total number of unique triangles found:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <2, 3, 0>
- <2, 3, 1>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <6, 5, 7>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <6, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
