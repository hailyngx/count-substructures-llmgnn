Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list all the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
4. Triangle <0, 5, 2>
5. Triangle <1, 5, 2>
6. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
7. Triangle <1, 4, 8>
8. Triangle <3, 1, 5>
9. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
10. Triangle <4, 8, 9>
11. Triangle <5, 2, 6>
12. Triangle <7, 1, 8>
13. Triangle <7, 4, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] triangles in the given graph.
