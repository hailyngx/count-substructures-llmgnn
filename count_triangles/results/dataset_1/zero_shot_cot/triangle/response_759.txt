Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Finding triangles in a graph involves finding sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step to find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 1 and 8.
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 9.
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 4 and 8.
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 3.
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 5 and 9.
8. Node 7: Connected to node 5.
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.

Next, let's find the triangles:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>

Now, count the total number of triangles: [5].
