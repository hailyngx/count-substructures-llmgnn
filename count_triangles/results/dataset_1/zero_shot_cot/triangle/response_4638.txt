Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 does not form a triangle with any other nodes.
2. Node 1 forms triangles with nodes 3, 6, and 7.
3. Node 2 does not form a triangle with any other nodes.
4. Node 3 forms a triangle with nodes 9.
5. Node 4 does not form a triangle with any other nodes.
6. Node 5 forms triangles with nodes 6 and 9.
7. Node 6 forms triangles with nodes 8 and 9.
8. Node 7 does not form a triangle with any other nodes.
9. Node 8 does not form a triangle with any other nodes.
10. Node 9 does not form a triangle with any other nodes.

Now, let's list the unique triangles:
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
