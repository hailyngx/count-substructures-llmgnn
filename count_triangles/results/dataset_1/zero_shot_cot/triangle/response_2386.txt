Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will look for unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's analyze the graph to identify the triangles:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to node 8.

Let's now identify the unique triangles:
1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <0, 7, 8>
3. <3, 7, 8>
4. <4, 6, 8>
5. <6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles in the given graph: [5]
