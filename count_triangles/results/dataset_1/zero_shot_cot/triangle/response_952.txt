Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we need to count the number of triangles.

Let's list the triangles found in the graph:

<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 0, 5>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<6, 3, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
