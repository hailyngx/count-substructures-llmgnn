Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

There are three nodes that form a triangle if they are all connected to each other. Let's list them:
1. <0, 4, 8>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <3, 4, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the graph.
