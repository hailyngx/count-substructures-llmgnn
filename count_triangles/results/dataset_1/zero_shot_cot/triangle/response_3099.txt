Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Here are the steps to find and count the triangles:

1. Look for each node in the graph and identify its neighbors based on the given edges.
   
2. For each node, check if there exist edges between pairs of its neighbors. If such edges exist, then there is a triangle formed with the original node.

3. Count the total number of triangles in the graph.

From the given graph information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.

Based on the connections above, the triangles in the graph are:

1. <1, 7, 8>
2. <1, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
