Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the triangles in the graph using the given edges:
- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
- Triangle 2: (0, 4, 6)

Next, let's count the total number of unique triangles: [2]
