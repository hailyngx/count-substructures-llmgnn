Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <1, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
