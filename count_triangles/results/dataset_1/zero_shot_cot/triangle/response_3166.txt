Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's determine the triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 0.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.

Now, let's find the triangles (closed loops of length 3) in this graph:

1. Triangles involving Node 0: None
2. Triangles involving Node 1: (0, 1, 4)
3. Triangles involving Node 2: None
4. Triangles involving Node 3: None
5. Triangles involving Node 4: None
6. Triangles involving Node 5: None
7. Triangles involving Node 6: None
8. Triangles involving Node 7: None
9. Triangles involving Node 8: None
10. Triangles involving Node 9: None

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 1, 4>.
