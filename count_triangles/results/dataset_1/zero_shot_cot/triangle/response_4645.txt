Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the existing edges.

After analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 3, 9>
3. <3, 5, 9>
4. <3, 7, 9>
5. <4, 6, 9>
6. <5, 6, 9>
7. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
