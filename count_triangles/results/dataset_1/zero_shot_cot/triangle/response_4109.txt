Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all triangles by looking for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.
2. Count each unique triangle found.

After analyzing the provided graph, we find the following triangles:

<0, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<5, 2, 7>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
