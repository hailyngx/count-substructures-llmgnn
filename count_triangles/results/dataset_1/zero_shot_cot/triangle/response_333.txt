Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's follow the step-by-step process:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Now, let's determine the triangles present in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 8>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
