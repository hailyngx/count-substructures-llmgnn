Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, let's first identify the triangles by looking for cycles of length 3.

The triangles in the given graph are:
1. <2, 6, 7>
2. <3, 6, 8>
3. <4, 5, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
