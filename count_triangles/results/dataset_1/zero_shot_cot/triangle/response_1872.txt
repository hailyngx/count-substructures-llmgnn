Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step using the provided information:

Step 1: Identify the triangles formed by each node:
- Node 0: No triangles
- Node 1: Triangles formed with (1, 6, 4), (1, 8, 4), (1, 9, 4), (1, 6, 9)
- Node 2: No triangles
- Node 3: No triangles
- Node 4: Triangles formed with (4, 6, 1), (4, 8, 1), (4, 9, 1), (4, 6, 9)
- Node 5: Triangles formed with (5, 2, 9), (5, 2, 3), (5, 3, 6), (5, 3, 9), (5, 6, 1), (5, 6, 4), (5, 6, 9)
- Node 6: Triangles formed with (6, 1, 4), (6, 1, 9), (6, 4, 8), (6, 4, 9), (6, 9, 1)
- Node 7: No triangles
- Node 8: No triangles
- Node 9: No additional triangles

Step 2: Count the total number of unique triangles:
- Unique triangles: <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 3>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
