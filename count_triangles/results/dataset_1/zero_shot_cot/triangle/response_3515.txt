Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Determine the triangles in the graph by finding all possible combinations of nodes connected by edges.
Since we have 10 nodes, we will check all possible triangles with 3 nodes.

Step 2: List down all the unique triangles found.
After checking all possible combinations, we found the following unique triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 6, 7>
<8, 5, 9>

Step 3: Count the total number of triangles.
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
