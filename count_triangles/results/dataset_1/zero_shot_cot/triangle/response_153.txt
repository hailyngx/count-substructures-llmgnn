Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can first identify all the triangles by looking for nodes that are connected to each other in a triangular manner. Let's list down the unique triangles:<1, 5, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
