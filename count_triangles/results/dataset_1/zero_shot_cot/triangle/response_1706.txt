Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the triangles in the graph by finding the nodes that form triangles when connected together.

The unique triangles found in the given graph are:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
