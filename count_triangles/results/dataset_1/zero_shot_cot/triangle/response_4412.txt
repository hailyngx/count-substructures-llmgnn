Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph, we can identify all the unique triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. Then we can count the total number of unique triangles found.

Let's list the unique triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <1, 2, 8>
3. <3, 4, 8>
4. <5, 8, 9>
5. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
