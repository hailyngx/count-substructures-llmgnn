Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 1>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
4. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
5. Triangle <0, 6, 1>
6. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
7. Triangle <2, 4, 8>
8. Triangle <2, 8, 5>
9. Triangle <2, 9, 6>
10. Triangle <3, 7, 5>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total in the given graph. So, the output is [10].
