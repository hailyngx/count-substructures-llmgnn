Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we can identify unique triangles by examining each possible set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Here are the unique triangles found in the graph:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
