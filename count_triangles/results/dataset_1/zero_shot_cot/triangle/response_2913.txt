Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the given edges.

Let's list the triangles one by one:
1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <1, 3, 6>
3. <2, 4, 5>
4. <2, 5, 6>
5. <5, 6, 7>
6. <6, 7, 8>
7. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
