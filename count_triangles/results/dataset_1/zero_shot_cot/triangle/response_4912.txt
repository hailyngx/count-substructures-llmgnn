Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Determine the neighbors of each node.
- Node 0: neighbors [3, 6, 7]
- Node 1: neighbors [2, 3, 5, 9]
- Node 2: neighbors [1, 6]
- Node 3: neighbors [0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8]
- Node 4: neighbors [3, 7, 8]
- Node 5: neighbor [1]
- Node 6: neighbors [0, 2, 3, 7]
- Node 7: neighbors [0, 3, 4, 6, 8]
- Node 8: neighbors [3, 4, 7, 9]
- Node 9: neighbors [1, 8]

Step 2: Count the triangles.
- Possible triangles involving each node:
  - Node 0: (0, 3, 6), (0, 3, 7), (0, 6, 7)
  - Node 1: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 9)
  - Node 2: (1, 2, 6)
  - Node 3: (0, 1, 3), (0, 3, 6), (0, 3, 7), (0, 3, 8), (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 9), (3, 4, 7), (3, 7, 8)
  - Node 4: (3, 4, 7), (3, 4, 8), (4, 7, 8)
  - Node 5: No triangles
  - Node 6: (0, 2, 6), (0, 3, 6), (0, 6, 7), (2, 6, 7), (3, 6, 7)
  - Node 7: (0, 3, 7), (0, 6, 7), (3, 4, 7), (3, 7, 8), (4, 7, 8)
  - Node 8: (3, 4, 8), (3, 7, 8), (4, 7, 8), (8, 9, 1)
  - Node 9: No triangles
  
Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
