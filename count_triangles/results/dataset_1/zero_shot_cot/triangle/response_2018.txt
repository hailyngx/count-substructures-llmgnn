Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in a graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6, forming three potential triangles <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, and <0, 5, 6>.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8, forming four potential triangles <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, and <2, 5, 8>.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5, forming three potential triangles <3, 2, 4>, <3, 2, 5>, and <3, 4, 5>.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 9, forming four potential triangles <4, 0, 3>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 0, 9>, and <4, 3, 7>.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 8, forming five potential triangles <5, 0, 2>, <5, 0, 3>, <5, 0, 7>, <5, 2, 3>, and <5, 2, 8>.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7, forming three potential triangles <6, 0, 2>, <6, 0, 7>, and <6, 2, 7>.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6, forming three potential triangles <7, 4, 5>, <7, 4, 6>, and <7, 5, 6>.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9, forming three potential triangles <8, 2, 5>, <8, 2, 9>, and <8, 5, 9>.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 8, forming one potential triangle <9, 4, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
