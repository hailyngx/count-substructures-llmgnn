Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for cycles of length three, also known as triangles.

Let's identify the triangles present in the graph by examining each potential triangle:

1. Nodes 0, 1, 3 do not form a triangle as edge (1, 3) is missing.
2. Nodes 0, 1, 4 form a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
3. Nodes 0, 1, 5 do not form a triangle as edge (0, 5) is missing.
4. Nodes 0, 1, 6 do not form a triangle as edge (1, 6) is missing.
5. Nodes 0, 1, 7 do not form a triangle.
6. Nodes 0, 1, 8 do not form a triangle.
7. Nodes 0, 1, 9 form a triangle <0, 1, 9>.
8. Nodes 0, 3, 4 do not form a triangle as edge (3, 4) is missing.
9. Nodes 0, 3, 6 do not form a triangle as edge (3, 6) is missing.
10. Nodes 0, 3, 8 do not form a triangle.
11. Nodes 0, 3, 9 do not form a triangle.
12. Nodes 0, 4, 6 do not form a triangle.
13. Nodes 0, 4, 8 do not form a triangle.
14. Nodes 0, 4, 9 do not form a triangle.
15. Nodes 0, 6, 8 form a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
16. Nodes 0, 6, 9 do not form a triangle.
17. Nodes 0, 8, 9 do not form a triangle.
18. Nodes 1, 5, 7 do not form a triangle.
19. Nodes 1, 5, 8 do not form a triangle.
20. Nodes 1, 5, 9 do not form a triangle.
21. Nodes 1, 7, 8 do not form a triangle.
22. Nodes 1, 7, 9 do not form a triangle.
23. Nodes 1, 8, 9 do not form a triangle.
24. Nodes 2, 7, 5 do not form a triangle as edge (2, 5) is missing.
25. Nodes 2, 7, 6 do not form a triangle.
26. Nodes 2, 7, 8 do not form a triangle.
27. Nodes 2, 8, 5 do not form a triangle.
28. Nodes 2, 8, 1 do not form a triangle.
29. Nodes 3, 6, 4 do not form a triangle.
30. Nodes 4, 6, 7 do not form a triangle.
31. Nodes 5, 6, 7 do not form a triangle.
32. Nodes 5, 6, 8 do not form a triangle.
33. Nodes 6, 8, 7 do not form a triangle.

From the identified triangles, we have found two unique triangles: <0, 1, 4> and <0, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
