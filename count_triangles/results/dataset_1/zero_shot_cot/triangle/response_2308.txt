Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the triangles in the graph by finding the nodes that form triangles. A triangle consists of three nodes where each node is connected to the other two nodes.

Triangle 1:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2

Triangle 2:
- Nodes: 0, 5, 4

Triangle 3:
- Nodes: 0, 6, 4

Triangle 4:
- Nodes: 0, 8, 2

Triangle 5:
- Nodes: 1, 2, 4

Triangle 6:
- Nodes: 1, 7, 4

Triangle 7:
- Nodes: 2, 6, 4

Hence, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles are as follows: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 8, 2>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 7, 4>, <2, 6, 4>.
