Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the edges. Let's start by listing the triangles one by one:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 8>
2. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 6, 8>
4. Triangle <0, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <1, 8, 3>
6. Triangle <4, 7, 8>
7. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
8. Triangle <4, 8, 5>
9. Triangle <4, 8, 6>
10. Triangle <4, 9, 5>
11. Triangle <5, 6, 8>
12. Triangle <5, 8, 7>
13. Triangle <5, 9, 4>
14. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
15. Triangle <7, 8, 4>
16. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 16 unique triangles in the given graph. Hence, the total number of triangles is [16].
