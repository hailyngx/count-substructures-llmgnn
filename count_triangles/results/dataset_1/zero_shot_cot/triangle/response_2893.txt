Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are mutually connected to each other. In order to do this, let's analyze each node's connections:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 1: Connected to node 4.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 3: Connected to node 0.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 8: Connected to node 2.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 5 and 6.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 4, 5>
2. Triangle <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
