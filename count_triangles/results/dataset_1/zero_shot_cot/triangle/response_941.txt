Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:
- First, let's identify the triangles: A triangle is formed when three nodes are all connected to each other.
- For example, if nodes A, B, and C are connected forming a triangle, the edges (A, B), (B, C), and (A, C) should exist in the graph.

The triangles in this graph are:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 1, 7>
4. <0, 4, 7>
5. <1, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
