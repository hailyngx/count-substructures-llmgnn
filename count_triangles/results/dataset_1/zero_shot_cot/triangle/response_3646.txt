Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find all the triangles in the given graph:

- Triangle 1: (0, 2, 4)
- Triangle 2: (1, 6, 7)
- Triangle 3: (2, 7, 3)
- Triangle 4: (3, 9, 7)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
