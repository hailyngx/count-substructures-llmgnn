Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].  

The unique triangles are:  
<0, 2, 8>  
<0, 4, 8>  
<0, 5, 6>  
<4, 5, 6>
