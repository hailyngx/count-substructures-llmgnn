Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected. A triangle is formed when three nodes are connected to each other in such a way that each pair of nodes shares an edge. Let's identify the triangles in this graph:

- Triangle 1: <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle 2: <4, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles in the graph: [2]
