Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's count the number of triangles.

To count the number of triangles, we can look for triangles formed by cycles of length 3 in the graph.

The unique triangles found in this graph are:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 7, 9>
4. <2, 3, 0>
5. <2, 3, 8>
6. <2, 8, 4>
7. <2, 8, 7>
8. <7, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
