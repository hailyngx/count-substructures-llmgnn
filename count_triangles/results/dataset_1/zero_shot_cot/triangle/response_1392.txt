Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the triangles
- For a triangle to exist in a graph, there should be three nodes connected in a closed loop.
- We will search for every instance of a connection of three nodes to form a triangle.

Triangles found:
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 9>

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles
- The total number of triangles in this graph is [6].
