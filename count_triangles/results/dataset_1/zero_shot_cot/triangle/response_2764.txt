Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify unique triangles formed by three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 0 forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, and 3.
2. Node 1 forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 4.
3. Node 2 forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 7.
4. Node 0, 1, and 7 form a triangle.
5. Node 0, 2, and 5 form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 4>, and <2, 5, 7>.
