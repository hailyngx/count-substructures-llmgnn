Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for all the possible triangles formed by the nodes connected by edges. 

Let's list the triangles based on the given edges:
1. <0, 4, 1>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <1, 4, 5>
4. <1, 4, 0>
5. <4, 5, 1>
6. <4, 5, 0>
7. <1, 5, 4>
8. <4, 0, 5>
9. <0, 1, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
