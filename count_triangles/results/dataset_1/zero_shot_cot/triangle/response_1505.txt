Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with its adjacency matrix:

```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
0 [ 0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  1 ]
1 [ 0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0 ]
2 [ 0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0 ]
3 [ 0  0  1  0  0  1  1  0  0  1 ]
4 [ 0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0 ]
5 [ 1  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  1 ]
6 [ 0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0 ]
7 [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 ]
8 [ 0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1 ]
9 [ 1  0  0  1  0  1  0  0  1
