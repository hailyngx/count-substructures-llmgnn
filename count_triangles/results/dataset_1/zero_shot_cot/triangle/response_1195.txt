Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, and <5, 8, 9>.
