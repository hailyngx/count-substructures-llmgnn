Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of three nodes that are fully connected to each other. 

Let's list all the unique triangles present in the graph:

1. <2, 3, 4>
2. <3, 4, 7>
3. <3, 7, 8>
4. <4, 7, 9>
5. <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
