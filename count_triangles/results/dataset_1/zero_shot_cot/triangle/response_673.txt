Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all the unique sets of three nodes that are connected by edges. Here are the triangles found in the given graph:

<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 8, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 9, 5>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 3, 9>
<9, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
