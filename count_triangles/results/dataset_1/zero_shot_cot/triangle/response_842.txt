Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible triangles in the given graph. A triangle is formed by three nodes connected by edges that form a closed loop.

Let's list the possible triangles:
1. <0, 3, 8>
2. <1, 2, 6>
3. <1, 5, 9>
4. <2, 3, 4>
5. <2, 4, 6>
6. <3, 4, 5>
7. <3, 5, 8>
8. <4, 5, 6>
9. <5, 6, 8>

Now, let's count the total number of unique triangles in this graph: [9]
