Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Starting with <0, 2, 4>:
1. Check if there is a connection between node 0 and node 4. There is no direct connection.
2. Check if there is a connection between node 0 and node 2. There is an edge between node 0 and node 2.
3. Check if there is a connection between node 2 and node 4. There is an edge between node 2 and node 4.
Therefore, <0, 2, 4> is a triangle.

Continuing:
- <0, 2, 7>: No triangle since there is no direct edge between node 0 and node 7.
- <0, 4, 6>: No triangle since there is no direct edge between node 0 and node 6.
- <0, 7, 1>: No triangle since there is no direct edge between node 0 and node 1.
- <1, 2, 7>: No triangle since there is no direct edge between node 1 and node 7.
- <2, 4, 3>: No triangle since there is no direct edge between node 2 and node 3.
- <2, 4, 9>: No triangle since there is no direct edge between node 2 and node 9.
- <2, 4, 6>: No triangle since there is no direct edge between node 2 and node 6.
- <2, 8, 3>: No triangle since there is no direct edge between node 2 and node 8.
- <3, 4, 6>: No triangle since there is no direct edge between node 3 and node 6.
- <3, 5, 8>: No triangle since there is no direct edge between node 3 and node 5.
- <4, 6, 9>: No triangle since there is no direct edge between node 4 and node 9.
- <7, 8, 0>: No triangle since there is no direct edge between node 7 and node 8.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
