Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's list down the triangles found in the graph:
1. <2, 4, 6>
2. <2, 4, 7>

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
