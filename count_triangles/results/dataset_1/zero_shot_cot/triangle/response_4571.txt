Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique triangles formed by the relationships between the nodes.

Let's list down the triangles found in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <1, 4, 9>
3. <1, 5, 3>
4. <2, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
