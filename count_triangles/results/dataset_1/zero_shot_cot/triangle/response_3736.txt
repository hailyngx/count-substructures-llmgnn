Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for sets of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Let's go step-by-step to find the triangles:

1. For node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6)
   - Potential triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>
   
2. For node 1: (1, 0), (1, 9)
   - Potential triangle: <1, 0, 9>
   
3. For node 2: (2, 0), (2, 5)
   - Potential triangle: <2, 0, 5>
   
4. For node 3: (3, 6)
   - No potential triangles
   
5. For node 4: (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 8)
   - Potential triangles: <4, 0, 6>, <4, 0, 8>, <4, 6, 8>
   
6. For node 5: (5, 2), (5, 7)
   - No potential triangles
   
7. For node 6: (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 9)
   - Potential triangles: <6, 0, 4>, <6, 0, 8>, <6, 0, 9>, <6, 3, 4>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 8, 9>
   
8. For node 7: (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9)
   - No potential triangles
   
9. For node 8: (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7)
   - Potential triangle: <8, 4, 6>
   
10. For node 9: (9, 1), (9, 6), (9, 7)
   - Potential triangle: <9, 1, 6>

Counting the unique triangles found, the output is: [12]
