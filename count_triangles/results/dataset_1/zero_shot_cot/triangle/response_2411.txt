Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of triangles in the given graph, we need to find all sets of nodes that are connected to each other forming a triangle. Let's follow these steps to identify the triangles:

Step 1: Identify the triangles in the graph:
- Looking at the edges, we can see that there are three types of triangles possible: 
  1. Triangles formed by nodes (0, 3, 6)
  2. Triangles formed by nodes (3, 4, 7)
  3. Triangles formed by nodes (6, 8, 9)

Step 2: Count the total number of triangles: 
- We have found 3 unique triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 3, 6>,
<3, 4, 7>,
<6, 8, 9>.
