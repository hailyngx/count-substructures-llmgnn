Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to look for cycles of length 3, where each node is connected to the other two nodes in the cycle.

Let's list the triangles present in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <2, 3, 5>
4. <5, 4, 6>
5. <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in total. So, the answer is [5].
