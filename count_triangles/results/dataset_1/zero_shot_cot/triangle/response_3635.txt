Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look at each possible triangle formed by 3 nodes.

Let's list the triangles one by one:
1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
