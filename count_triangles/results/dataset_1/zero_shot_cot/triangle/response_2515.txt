Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the triangles in the graph. A triangle is formed when there are three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Given the edges provided, the triangles in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 6>
3. <0, 1, 7>
4. <0, 5, 6>
5. <1, 4, 8>
6. <1, 6, 9>
7. <4, 6, 9>
8. <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
