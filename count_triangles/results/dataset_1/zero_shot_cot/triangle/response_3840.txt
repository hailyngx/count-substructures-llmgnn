Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we can look for any set of three nodes that are all connected to each other.

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 5, 8>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 4>
3. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
4. Triangle <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
